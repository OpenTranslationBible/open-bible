## Isaiah 40:3
A voice of one calling out: “In the wilderness prepare the way for the Lord; make straight in the desert a highway for our God.

Then the majesty of the Lord will be unveiled, and all people will witness it together. For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.”

## Isaiah 40:12
Who has gauged the waters in the hollow of His hand, or with the span of His hand set the heavens in place? Who has gathered the dust of the earth in a measure, or weighed the mountains on the scales and the hills in a balance?

## Isaiah 40:13
Who can comprehend the Spirit of the Lord, or serve as the Lord's advisor?

## Isaiah 40:14
Whom did He consult to enlighten Him, and who taught Him the right way? Who was it that taught Him knowledge, or showed Him the path of understanding?

## Isaiah 40:15
Surely the nations are like a drop in a bucket; they are regarded as dust on the scales; He lifts up the islands like fine dust.

## Isaiah 40:16
Even Lebanon is not sufficient for altar fires, nor its animals enough for burnt offerings.

## Isaiah 40:17
Before Him all the nations are as nothing; they are regarded by Him as less than nothing and meaningless.

## Isaiah 40:18
With whom, then, will you compare God? To what likeness will you liken Him?

## Isaiah 40:19
As for an idol, a craftsman casts it, and a goldsmith overlays it with gold and fashions silver chains for it.

## Isaiah 40:20
A person too impoverished for such an offering selects wood that will not rot; they look for a skilled craftsman to set up an idol that will not totter.

## Isaiah 40:21
Do you not know? Have you not heard? Has it not been told to you from the beginning? Have you not understood since the foundations of the earth?

## Isaiah 40:22
He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth, and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers. He stretches out the heavens like a canopy and spreads them out like a tent to live in.

## Isaiah 40:23
He brings princes to insignificance and reduces the rulers of this world to nothing.

## Isaiah 40:26
Lift up your eyes and look to the heavens: Who created all these? It is He who brings out the starry host one by one and calls forth each of them by name. Because of His great power and mighty strength, not one of them is missing.

## Isaiah 40:27
Why do you complain, Jacob? Why do you say, Israel, “My way is concealed from the Lord; my cause is overlooked by my God”?

## Isaiah 40:28
Do you not know? Have you not heard? The Lord is the eternal God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He will not grow tired or weary, and His understanding is beyond human reach.

## Isaiah 40:29
He provides strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak.

## Isaiah 40:30
Even youths grow tired and weary, and vigorous young men stumble and fall;

## Isaiah 40:31
but those who wait for the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.
