# Isaiah Chapter 40

## Isaiah 40:1  
“Comfort, comfort My people,” says your God.

## Isaiah 40:2  
“Speak kindly to Jerusalem;  
And call out to her, that her warfare has ended,  
That her guilt has been removed,  
That she has received of the Lord’s hand  
Double for all her sins.”

## Isaiah 40:3  
The voice of one calling out,  
“Clear the way for the Lord in the wilderness;  
Make straight in the desert a highway for our God.

## Isaiah 40:4  
Let every valley be lifted up,  
And every mountain and hill be made low;  
And let the uneven ground become a plain,  
And the rugged terrain a broad valley;

## Isaiah 40:5  
Then the glory of the Lord will be revealed,  
And all flesh will see it together;  
For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.”

## Isaiah 40:6  
A voice says, “Call out.”  
Then he answered, “What shall I call out?”  
All flesh is grass, and all its loveliness is like the flower of the field.

## Isaiah 40:7  
The grass withers, the flower fades,  
When the breath of the Lord blows upon it;  
The people are indeed grass!

## Isaiah 40:8  
The grass withers, the flower fades,  
But the word of our God stands forever.

## Isaiah 40:9  
Go up on a high mountain, Zion, messenger of good news,  
Raise your voice forcefully, Jerusalem, messenger of good news;  
Raise it up, do not fear.  
Say to the cities of Judah,  
“Here is your God!”

## Isaiah 40:10  
Behold, the Lord God will come with might,  
With His arm ruling for Him.  
Behold, His compensation is with Him,  
And His reward before Him.

## Isaiah 40:11  
Like a shepherd He will tend His flock,  
In His arm He will gather the lambs  
And carry them in the fold of His robe;  
He will gently lead the nursing ewes.

## Isaiah 40:12  
Who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand,  
And measured the heavens with a span,  
And calculated the dust of the earth with a measure,  
And weighed the mountains in a balance,  
And the hills in a pair of scales?

## Isaiah 40:13  
Who has directed the Spirit of the Lord,  
Or as His counselor has informed Him?

## Isaiah 40:14  
With whom did He consult, and who gave Him understanding?  
And who taught Him in the path of justice,  
And taught Him knowledge,  
And informed Him of the way of understanding?

## Isaiah 40:15  
Behold, the nations are like a drop from a bucket,  
And are regarded as a speck of dust on the scales;  
Behold, He lifts up the islands like fine dust.

## Isaiah 40:16  
Even Lebanon is not enough to burn,  
Nor its animals enough for a burnt offering.

## Isaiah 40:17  
All the nations are as nothing before Him,  
They are regarded by Him as less than nothing and meaningless.

## Isaiah 40:18  
To whom then will you liken God?  
Or what likeness will you compare with Him?

## Isaiah 40:19  
As for the idol, a craftsman casts it,  
A goldsmith plates it with gold,  
And a silversmith fashions chains of silver.

## Isaiah 40:20  
He who is too impoverished for such an offering  
Selects a tree that does not rot;  
He seeks out for himself a skillful craftsman  
To prepare an idol that will not totter.

## Isaiah 40:21  
Do you not know? Have you not heard?  
Has it not been declared to you from the beginning?  
Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?

## Isaiah 40:22  
It is He who sits above the circle of the earth,  
And its inhabitants are like grasshoppers,  
Who stretches out the heavens like a curtain  
And spreads them out like a tent to live in.

## Isaiah 40:23  
It is He who reduces rulers to nothing,  
Who makes the judges of the earth meaningless.

## Isaiah 40:24  
Scarcely have they been planted,  
Scarcely have they been sown,  
Scarcely has their stock taken root in the earth,  
But He merely blows on them, and they wither,  
And the storm carries them away like stubble.

## Isaiah 40:25  
“To whom then will you compare Me,  
That I would be his equal?” says the Holy One.

## Isaiah 40:26  
Raise your eyes on high  
And see who has created these stars,  
The One who brings out their multitude by number,  
He calls them all by name;  
Because of the greatness of His might and the strength of His power,  
Not one of them is missing.

## Isaiah 40:27  
Why do you say, Jacob, and you assert, Israel,  
“My way is hidden from the Lord,  
And the justice due me escapes the notice of my God”?

## Isaiah 40:28  
Do you not know? Have you not heard?  
The Everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth  
Does not become weary or tired.  
His understanding is unsearchable.

## Isaiah 40:29  
He gives strength to the weary,  
And to the one who lacks might He increases power.

## Isaiah 40:30  
Though youths grow weary and tired,  
And vigorous young men stumble badly,

## Isaiah 40:31  
Yet those who wait for the Lord  
Will gain new strength;  
They will mount up with wings like eagles,  
They will run and not get tired,  
They will walk and not become weary.
