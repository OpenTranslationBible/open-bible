# Isaiah Chapter 26

## Isaiah 26:1
On that day, this song will be sung in the land of Judah: “We have a strong city; God sets up salvation as its walls and ramparts for security.

## Isaiah 26:2
Open the gates, that the righteous nation may enter, the nation that remains faithful.

## Isaiah 26:3
You will keep in perfect peace those whose minds are steadfast, because they trust in you.

## Isaiah 26:4
Trust in the Lord forever, for the Lord God is the eternal Rock.

## Isaiah 26:5
He has brought low those who dwell on high; the lofty city he lays low, he levels it to the ground and casts it to the dust.

## Isaiah 26:6
The foot will trample it down— the feet of the poor, the steps of the oppressed.

## Isaiah 26:7
The path of the righteous is level; O Upright One, you make the way of the righteous smooth.

## Isaiah 26:8
Indeed, while following the way of your laws, Lord, we have waited for you; your name and your renown are the desire of our souls.

## Isaiah 26:9
At night my soul longs for you, indeed, my spirit within me seeks you diligently; for when your judgments come upon the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.

## Isaiah 26:10
Though compassion is shown to the wicked, they do not learn righteousness; they continue to act unjustly in a land of uprightness and do not perceive the majesty of the Lord.

## Isaiah 26:11
Lord, your hand is lifted high, yet they do not see it. Let them see your zeal for your people and be put to shame; indeed, let the fire reserved for your enemies consume them.

## Isaiah 26:12
Lord, you will establish peace for us, since you have also performed for us all our works.

## Isaiah 26:13
Lord our God, other lords besides you have ruled over us, but your name alone do we honour.

## Isaiah 26:14
The dead will not live, the departed spirits will not rise; therefore you have punished and destroyed them, and you have wiped out all memory of them.

## Isaiah 26:15
You have increased the nation, Lord; you have increased the nation. You have gained glory for yourself; you have extended all the borders of the land.

## Isaiah 26:16
Lord, they sought you in their distress; when you disciplined them, they could only whisper a prayer.

## Isaiah 26:17
As a pregnant woman about to give birth writhes and cries out in her labour pains, so were we in your presence, Lord.

## Isaiah 26:18
We were pregnant, we writhed in labour, but we gave birth to wind. We could not accomplish deliverance for the earth, nor were the inhabitants of the world born.

## Isaiah 26:19
Your dead will live; their bodies will rise. You who dwell in the dust, awake and shout for joy, for your dew is like the dew of the dawn, and the earth will give birth to the departed spirits.

## Isaiah 26:20
Come, my people, enter your rooms and close your doors behind you; hide for a little while until the indignation has passed by.

## Isaiah 26:21
For behold, the Lord is coming out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their wrongdoing; the earth will reveal her bloodshed and will no longer cover her slain.
