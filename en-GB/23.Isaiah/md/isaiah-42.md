# Isaiah Chapter 42

## Isaiah 42:1

“Behold, my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved chosen one in whom my soul delights. I have put my Spirit upon him; he shall bring forth justice to the nations.

## Isaiah 42:2

He will not cry out nor raise his voice, nor make his voice heard in the streets.

## Isaiah 42:3

A bruised reed he will not break, and a dimly burning wick he will not snuff out; he will faithfully bring forth justice.

## Isaiah 42:4

He will not falter or be discouraged until he has established justice on the earth; and the coastlands shall wait expectantly for his teaching.”

## Isaiah 42:5

This is what God the Lord says, who created the heavens and stretched them out, who spread out the earth and all that springs from it, who gives breath to its people and spirit to those who walk on it:

## Isaiah 42:6

“I am the Lord; I have called you in righteousness, I will hold you by the hand and watch over you, and I will appoint you as a covenant to the people, a light to the nations,

## Isaiah 42:7

to give sight to the blind, to free captives from confinement, and those who reside in darkness from their imprisonment.

## Isaiah 42:8

I am the Lord; this is my name! I will not share my glory with another, nor my praise with idols.

## Isaiah 42:9

Behold, the former things have come to pass, and new things I declare; before they spring forth I announce them to you.”

## Isaiah 42:10

Sing to the Lord a new song, his praise from the ends of the earth, you who go down to the sea and all that is in it, you islands and those who live on them.

## Isaiah 42:11

Let the wilderness and its towns raise their voices, the settlements where Kedar inhabits. Let the inhabitants of Sela sing for joy; let them shout from the mountaintops.

## Isaiah 42:12

Let them give glory to the Lord and declare his praise in the coastlands.

## Isaiah 42:13

The Lord will go out like a warrior; he will stir up his zeal like a man of war. With a shout he will raise the battle cry and will triumph over his enemies.

## Isaiah 42:14

“I have kept silent for a long time; I have been quiet and restrained myself. Now, like a woman in labour, I will groan, I will both gasp and pant.

## Isaiah 42:15

I will lay waste the mountains and hills and wither all their vegetation; I will turn rivers into coastlands and dry up the ponds.

## Isaiah 42:16

I will lead the blind by ways they have not known, along unfamiliar paths I will guide them. I will turn darkness into light before them and make the rough places smooth. These are the things I will do, and I will not forsake them.

## Isaiah 42:17

They will be turned back and utterly shamed, those who trust in idols, who say to cast images, ‘You are our gods.’

## Isaiah 42:18

Listen, you deaf; look, you blind, and see!

## Isaiah 42:19

Who is blind but my servant, or so deaf as my messenger whom I send? Who is so blind as the one in covenant with me, or so blind as the servant of the Lord?

## Isaiah 42:20

You have seen many things, but you do not remember them; your ears are open, but no one listens.

## Isaiah 42:21

The Lord was pleased, for his righteousness’ sake, to make his law great and glorious.

## Isaiah 42:22

But this is a people plundered and pillaged; all of them trapped in pits or hidden away in prisons. They have become plunder, with no one to rescue them; they have been made loot, with no one to say, “Send them back.”

## Isaiah 42:23

Who among you will heed this? Who will pay attention and listen for the future?

## Isaiah 42:24

Who gave Jacob up for spoil, and Israel to the plunderers? Was it not the Lord, against whom we have sinned? For they would not follow his ways, nor did they obey his law.

## Isaiah 42:25

So he poured out on them the heat of his anger and the violence of war; it enveloped them in flames, yet they did not understand; it consumed them, but they paid no attention.
