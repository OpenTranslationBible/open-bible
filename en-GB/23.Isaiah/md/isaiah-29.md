# Isaiah Chapter 29

## Isaiah 29:1
Woe to you, Ariel, Ariel, the city where David encamped! Add year upon year, let your cycle of festivals continue.

## Isaiah 29:2
Yet I will bring distress upon Ariel, and she shall be a city of sorrow and lamentation; she will be to me like an altar hearth.

## Isaiah 29:3
I will encamp against you all around; I will besiege you with towers and raise up siegeworks against you.

## Isaiah 29:4
Brought low, you shall speak from the ground; your words will come from the dust where you lie prostrate. Your voice will be like that of a spirit from the earth, and your speech will whisper from the dust.

## Isaiah 29:5
But the multitude of your foes shall become like fine dust, and the ruthless hordes like chaff that blows away; it shall happen suddenly, in an instant.

## Isaiah 29:6
From the Lord of Hosts you shall be visited with thunder, earthquake, and a great noise, with whirlwind and tempest, and the flame of a devouring fire.

## Isaiah 29:7
The multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, that besiege her and her stronghold, shall be as a dream, a vision of the night.

## Isaiah 29:8
It will be like when a hungry person dreams of eating but wakes up hungry, or when a thirsty person dreams of drinking but wakes up faint and thirsty. So shall it be with the multitude of all the nations that fight against Mount Zion.

## Isaiah 29:9
Be stunned and amazed; blind yourselves and be sightless; they are drunk, but not with wine, they stagger, but not with strong drink.

## Isaiah 29:10
For the Lord has poured upon you a spirit of deep sleep; He has closed your eyes, the prophets, and covered your heads, the seers.

## Isaiah 29:11
This entire vision will be to you like the words of a sealed book. When it is given to one who can read, saying, “Read this, please,” he will say, “I cannot, for it is sealed.”

## Isaiah 29:12
Or if it is given to one who cannot read, saying, “Read this, please,” he will say, “I do not know how to read.”

## Isaiah 29:13
The Lord says: “These people draw near to me with their mouth and honour me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. Their reverence for me is based on human rules taught by men.

## Isaiah 29:14
Therefore, behold, I will again do a marvellous work among this people, a wondrous work; the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hidden.”

## Isaiah 29:15
Woe to those who seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord, whose deeds are done in darkness, and who say, “Who sees us? Who knows us?”

## Isaiah 29:16
You turn things upside down! Shall the potter be regarded as the clay, that the thing made should say of its maker, “He did not make me,” or the thing formed say of him who formed it, “He has no understanding”?

## Isaiah 29:17
Is it not yet a very little while until Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be regarded as a forest?

## Isaiah 29:18
On that day the deaf shall hear the words of a book, and out of their gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind shall see.

## Isaiah 29:19
The humble shall increase their joy in the Lord, and the needy among mankind shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.

## Isaiah 29:20
For the ruthless shall come to an end, and the mockers shall be finished, and all who watch for iniquity shall be cut off—

## Isaiah 29:21
those who make a man an offender by a word, and lay a snare for him who reproves in the gate, and with false testimony turn aside the just.

## Isaiah 29:22
Therefore, thus says the Lord, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: “Jacob shall not now be ashamed, nor shall his face now grow pale.

## Isaiah 29:23
But when he sees his children, the work of my hands, in his midst, they shall sanctify my name; they shall sanctify the Holy One of Jacob and stand in awe of the God of Israel.

## Isaiah 29:24
Those who err in spirit shall come to understanding, and those who grumble shall accept instruction.”
