# Isaiah Chapter 29

## Isaiah 29:1

Woe, Ariel, Ariel the city where David encamped!  
Add year to year, observe your festivals on schedule.

## Isaiah 29:2

I will bring distress to Ariel,  
And she will be mourning and crying;  
And she will be like an Ariel to Me.

## Isaiah 29:3

I will camp against you encircling you,  
And I will set up siegeworks against you,  
And I will raise up battle towers against you.

## Isaiah 29:4

Then you will be brought low, you will speak from the earth,  
And your speech will whisper from the dust;  
Your voice will be like that of a spirit from the ground,  
And your speech will whisper from the dust.

## Isaiah 29:5

But the multitude of your enemies will become like fine dust,  
And the multitude of the ruthless ones like the chaff which blows away;  
And it will happen instantly, suddenly.

## Isaiah 29:6

From the Lord of armies you will be punished with thunder and earthquake and loud noise,  
With whirlwind and tempest and the flame of a consuming fire.

## Isaiah 29:7

And the multitude of all the nations who wage war against Ariel,  
Even all who wage war against her and her stronghold, and who distress her,  
Will be like a dream, a vision of the night.

## Isaiah 29:8

It will be as when a hungry person dreams—and behold, he is eating;  
But when he awakens, his hunger is not satisfied.  
Or as when a thirsty person dreams—and behold, he is drinking;  
But when he awakens, behold, he is faint and his thirst is not quenched.  
So will the multitude of all the nations be  
Who wage war against Mount Zion.

## Isaiah 29:9

Be delayed and wait,  
Blind yourselves and be blind;  
They become drunk, but not with wine,  
They stagger, but not with intoxicating drink.

## Isaiah 29:10

For the Lord has poured over you a spirit of deep sleep,  
He has shut your eyes—the prophets;  
And He has covered your heads—the seers.

## Isaiah 29:11

The entire vision will be to you like the words of a sealed book,  
Which, when they give it to one who is literate, saying, “Please read this,” he will say, “I cannot, because it is sealed.”

## Isaiah 29:12

Then the book will be given to the one who is illiterate, saying, “Please read this.”  
And he will say, “I cannot read.”

## Isaiah 29:13

Then the Lord said,  
“Because this people approaches Me with their words  
And honors Me with their lips,  
But their heart is far from Me,  
And their reverence for Me consists of tradition learned by rote,

## Isaiah 29:14

Therefore behold, I will once again deal marvelously with this people, wondrously marvelous;  
And the wisdom of their wise men will perish,  
And the understanding of their men who have understanding will be hidden.”

## Isaiah 29:15

Woe to those who deeply hide their plans from the Lord,  
And whose deeds are done in a dark place,  
And they say, “Who sees us?” or “Who knows us?”

## Isaiah 29:16

You turn things around!  
Shall the potter be considered the same as the clay,  
That what is made would say to its maker, “He did not make me”;  
Or what is formed say to him who formed it, “He has no understanding”?

## Isaiah 29:17

Is it not yet just a little while  
Before Lebanon will be turned into a fertile field,  
And the fertile field will be considered as a forest?

## Isaiah 29:18

On that day the deaf will hear words of a book,  
And out of their gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind will see.

## Isaiah 29:19

The afflicted also will increase their joy in the Lord,  
And the needy of mankind will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.

## Isaiah 29:20

For the ruthless will come to an end and the scorner will be finished,  
Indeed all who are intent on doing evil will be eliminated;

## Isaiah 29:21

Who cause a person to be indicted by a word,  
And set a trap for the arbitrator at the gate,  
And defraud the one in the right with meaningless arguments.

## Isaiah 29:22

Therefore this is what the Lord, who redeemed Abraham, says concerning the house of Jacob:  
“Jacob will not be ashamed now, nor will his face turn pale;

## Isaiah 29:23

But when he sees his children, the work of My hands, in his midst,  
They will sanctify My name;  
Indeed, they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob,  
And will stand in awe of the God of Israel.

## Isaiah 29:24

Those who err in mind will know the truth,  
And those who criticize will accept instruction.”
