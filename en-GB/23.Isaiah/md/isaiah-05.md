# Isaiah Chapter 5

## Isaiah 5:1

Let me sing for my beloved a song about his vineyard: My beloved had a vineyard on a fertile hillside.

## Isaiah 5:2

He dug it up, cleared it of stones, and planted it with the choicest vines. He built a watchtower in the midst of it and carved out a winepress as well. Then he looked for a crop of good grapes, but it produced only worthless fruit.

## Isaiah 5:3

“And now, you dwellers in Jerusalem and people of Judah, judge between me and my vineyard.

## Isaiah 5:4

What more could have been done for my vineyard than I have done for it? When I expected good grapes, why did it yield only bad ones?

## Isaiah 5:5

Now I will tell you what I am going to do to my vineyard: I will remove its hedge, and it will be consumed; I will break down its wall, and it will be trampled.

## Isaiah 5:6

I will lay it waste; it will neither be pruned nor cultivated, and briers and thorns will grow there. I will command the clouds not to rain on it.”

## Isaiah 5:7

For the vineyard of the Lord Almighty is the house of Israel, and the people of Judah are the vines he delighted in. He looked for justice, but saw bloodshed; for righteousness, but heard cries of distress.

## Isaiah 5:8

Woe to those who add house to house and join field to field, until there is no space left and you are alone in the land.

## Isaiah 5:9

The Lord Almighty has declared in my hearing: “Many houses will become desolate, even great and fine ones, without occupants.

## Isaiah 5:10

A ten-acre vineyard will yield only a bath of wine, and a homer of seed will yield only an ephah of grain.”

## Isaiah 5:11

Woe to those who rise early in the morning to pursue strong drink, who stay up late at night till they are inflamed with wine.

## Isaiah 5:12

Their banquets are accompanied by lyres and harps, by tambourines and flutes, and by wine; but they have no regard for the deeds of the Lord, nor do they consider the work of his hands.

## Isaiah 5:13

Therefore my people will go into exile for their lack of understanding; their nobles will die of hunger, and the multitude will be parched with thirst.

## Isaiah 5:14

Therefore Sheol has enlarged its throat and opened its mouth beyond measure; into it will descend their nobles and masses, with all their revelry and jubilance.

## Isaiah 5:15

So people will be humbled and everyone brought low, the eyes of the haughty will be humbled.

## Isaiah 5:16

But the Lord Almighty will be exalted by his justice, and the holy God will show himself holy by his righteousness.

## Isaiah 5:17

Then lambs will graze as in their own pasture, and strangers will eat among the ruins of the wealthy.

## Isaiah 5:18

Woe to those who drag sin along with cords of deceit, and wickedness as with cart ropes,

## Isaiah 5:19

to those who say, “Let God hurry, let him hasten his work so we may see it; let the plan of the Holy One of Israel approach and come to pass, so we may know it.”

## Isaiah 5:20

Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who substitute darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter.

## Isaiah 5:21

Woe to those who consider themselves wise and perceive themselves as clever.

## Isaiah 5:22

Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine and valiant in mixing strong drink,

## Isaiah 5:23

who acquit the guilty for a bribe, and deny justice to the innocent.

## Isaiah 5:24

Therefore, as a tongue of fire consumes stubble and dry grass collapses in the flames, so their roots will decay and their blossoms blow away like dust; for they have rejected the law of the Lord Almighty and spurned the word of the Holy One of Israel.

## Isaiah 5:25

Therefore the Lord’s anger burns against his people; his hand is raised and he strikes them down. The mountains shake, and their corpses lie like refuse in the streets. Yet for all this, his anger is not turned away, his hand is still upraised.

## Isaiah 5:26

He lifts up a banner for distant nations and whistles for those at the ends of the earth. Here they come, swiftly and speedily!

## Isaiah 5:27

No one among them grows tired or stumbles, no one slumbers or sleeps; not a belt is loosened at the waist, nor a sandal strap broken.

## Isaiah 5:28

Their arrows are sharp, all their bows are bent; their horses’ hooves seem like flint, and their chariot wheels like a whirlwind.

## Isaiah 5:29

Their roar is like that of a lioness, they roar like young lions; they growl as they seize their prey and carry it off with no one to rescue.

## Isaiah 5:30

In that day they will roar over it like the roaring of the sea. And if one looks at the land, there is only darkness and distress; even the light is darkened by clouds.
