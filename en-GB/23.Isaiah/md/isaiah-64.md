# Isaiah Chapter 64

## Isaiah 64:1
If only you would open the heavens and come down, so that the mountains might tremble at your presenceâ€”

## Isaiah 64:2
As fire kindles brushwood and causes water to boil, come down to make your name known to your adversaries, that the nations may tremble at your presence!

## Isaiah 64:3
When you did awesome things that we did not expect, you came down, and the mountains quaked at your presence.

## Isaiah 64:4
Since ancient times, no one has heard or perceived by ear, nor has the eye seen any God besides you, who acts on behalf of those who wait for him.

## Isaiah 64:5
You meet those who rejoice in doing righteousness, who remember you in your ways. Behold, you were angry, for we sinned; we continued in our sins for a long time. How then shall we be saved?

## Isaiah 64:6
For all of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment; we all wither like a leaf, and our wrongdoings, like the wind, carry us away.

## Isaiah 64:7
There is no one who calls on your name or stirs himself to take hold of you; for you have hidden your face from us and have surrendered us to the power of our wrongdoings.

## Isaiah 64:8
Yet you, Lord, are our Father. We are the clay, and you are our potter; we are all the work of your hand.

## Isaiah 64:9
Do not be angry beyond measure, Lord, nor remember our wrongdoings forever. Behold, please look, for we are all your people.

## Isaiah 64:10
Your holy cities have become a wilderness; Zion has become a wasteland, Jerusalem a desolation.

## Isaiah 64:11
Our holy and beautiful temple, where our ancestors praised you, has been burned with fire, and all our treasured things have become a ruin.

## Isaiah 64:12
Will you hold back at these things, Lord? Will you remain silent and let us suffer beyond measure?
