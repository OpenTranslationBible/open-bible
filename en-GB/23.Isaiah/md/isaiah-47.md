## Isaiah 47:1
“Descend and sit in the dust, Virgin Daughter of Babylon; sit on the ground without a throne, Daughter of the Chaldeans. You will no longer be called tender and delicate.

## Isaiah 47:2

## Isaiah 47:3

## Isaiah 47:4
Our Redeemer, the Lord of Hosts is His name, the Sacred One of Israel.

## Isaiah 47:5
“Sit in silence and enter into darkness, Daughter of the Chaldeans; for you will no longer be called the queen of kingdoms.

## Isaiah 47:6
I was angry with My people, I desecrated My inheritance and delivered them into your hand. You showed them no mercy; even on the elderly, you laid a heavy yoke.

## Isaiah 47:7
You said, ‘I will be queen forever,’ but you did not consider these things or reflect on their outcome.

## Isaiah 47:8
“Now then, listen, you who indulge in pleasure, dwelling securely, saying in your heart, ‘I am, and there is none besides me. I will never be a widow or know the loss of children.’

## Isaiah 47:9
These two things will come upon you suddenly in one day: loss of children and widowhood. They will come upon you in full despite your many sorceries and potent spells.

## Isaiah 47:10
You have felt secure in your wickedness and said, ‘No one sees me.’ Your wisdom and knowledge have misled you, for you have said in your heart, ‘I am, and there is none besides me.’

## Isaiah 47:11
But disaster will come upon you, and you will not know how to charm it away. Calamity will fall upon you that you cannot avert; destruction you cannot foresee will come upon you suddenly.

## Isaiah 47:12
“Continue with your spells and your many sorceries, which you have practised since your youth. Perhaps you will succeed, perhaps you will cause trembling.

## Isaiah 47:13
You are wearied by your many counsels; let your astrologers stand up, those who gaze at the stars and predict by the new moons, let them save you from what is coming upon you.

## Isaiah 47:14
Surely they are like stubble; the fire will consume them. They cannot save themselves from the power of the flame. This is not a coal for warming, nor a fire to sit by.

## Isaiah 47:15
This is what they have become to you, those with whom you have laboured, those who have dealt with you from your youth; each wanders in his own direction; there is no one to save you.
