# Isaiah Chapter 47

## Isaiah 47:1  
Come down and sit in the dust,  
Virgin daughter of Babylon;  
Sit on the ground without a throne,  
Daughter of the Chaldeans!  
For you shall no longer be called tender and delicate.

## Isaiah 47:2  
Take the millstones and grind flour.  
Remove your veil, strip off the skirt,  
Uncover the leg, cross the rivers.

## Isaiah 47:3  
Your nakedness will be uncovered,  
Your shame will also be exposed;  
I will take vengeance and will not spare a person.

## Isaiah 47:4  
Our Redeemer, the Lord of armies is His name,  
The Holy One of Israel.

## Isaiah 47:5  
Sit silently, and go into darkness,  
Daughter of the Chaldeans;  
For you will no longer be called  
The queen of kingdoms.

## Isaiah 47:6  
I was angry with My people,  
I profaned My heritage,  
And I turned them over to you.  
You did not show mercy to them,  
On the aged you made your yoke very heavy.

## Isaiah 47:7  
Yet you said, ‘I will be a queen forever.’  
These things you did not consider  
Nor remember the outcome of them.

## Isaiah 47:8  
Now, then, hear this, you luxuriant one,  
Who lives securely,  
Who says in her heart,  
‘I am, and there is no one besides me.  
I will not sit as a widow,  
Nor know the loss of children.’

## Isaiah 47:9  
But these two things will come on you suddenly in one day:  
Loss of children and widowhood.  
They will come on you in full measure  
In spite of your many sorceries,  
In spite of the great power of your spells.

## Isaiah 47:10  
You felt secure in your wickedness and said,  
‘No one sees me,’  
Your wisdom and your knowledge, they have led you astray;  
For you have said in your heart,  
‘I am, and there is no one besides me.’

## Isaiah 47:11  
But evil will come on you  
Which you will not know how to charm away;  
And disaster will fall on you  
For which you cannot atone;  
And destruction about which you do not know  
Will come on you suddenly.

## Isaiah 47:12  
Persist now in your spells  
And in your many sorceries  
With which you have labored from your youth;  
Perhaps you will be able to benefit,  
Perhaps you may cause trembling.

## Isaiah 47:13  
You are tired from your many consultations;  
Let them stand now and save you,  
Those who study the heavens,  
Who gaze at the stars,  
Who predict by the new moons  
From month to month what will happen to you.

## Isaiah 47:14  
Behold, they have become like stubble,  
Fire burns them;  
They cannot save themselves from the power of the flame;  
There will be no coal to warm by  
Nor a fire to sit before!

## Isaiah 47:15  
So have those become to you with whom you have labored,  
Who have trafficked with you from your youth;  
Each has wandered in his own way;  
There is no one to save you.
