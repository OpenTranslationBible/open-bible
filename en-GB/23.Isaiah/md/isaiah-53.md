# Isaiah Chapter 53

## Isaiah 53:1

Who then has received our report? Who then has witnessed the strong arm of the Lord?

## Isaiah 53:2

He grew up before Him like a tender shoot, and like a root out of dry ground. He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to Him, nor any appearance that we should desire Him.

## Isaiah 53:3

He was despised and rejected by humanity, a man of suffering, familiar with pain. Like one from whom people hide their faces, He was despised, and we held Him in low regard.

## Isaiah 53:4

Surely He took up our pain and bore our suffering, yet we considered Him stricken by God, afflicted, and humiliated.

## Isaiah 53:5

But He was pierced for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon Him, and by His wounds we are healed.

## Isaiah 53:6

We all have wandered like sheep, each of us has turned to our own path; and the Lord has placed upon Him the iniquity of us all.

## Isaiah 53:7

He was oppressed and afflicted, yet He remained silent; He was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before its shearers is silent, so He remained silent.

## Isaiah 53:8

Through oppression and judgment He was taken away. Yet who among His generation considered it? For He was cut off from the land of the living; for the transgression of my people He was punished.

## Isaiah 53:9

He was given a grave with the wicked, and with the rich in His death, though He had done no violence, nor was any deceit found in His mouth.

## Isaiah 53:10

Yet it was the Lordâ€™s will to crush Him and cause Him to suffer. When He makes His life an offering for sin, He will see His offspring and prolong His days, and the will of the Lord will prosper in His hand.

## Isaiah 53:11

After He has suffered, He will see the light of life and be satisfied; by His knowledge, my righteous servant will justify many, for He will bear their iniquities.

## Isaiah 53:12

Therefore, I will allot Him a portion among the great, and He will share the spoils with the strong, because He poured out His life unto death and was counted among the transgressors. For He bore the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors.
