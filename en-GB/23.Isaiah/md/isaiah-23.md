# Isaiah Chapter 23

## Isaiah 23:1
A message concerning Tyre: Lament, you ships of Tarshish, for Tyre is laid waste, without house or harbour; it is reported to them from the land of Cyprus.

## Isaiah 23:2
Be silent, you who dwell on the coast, you merchants of Sidon; your envoys have crossed the sea.

## Isaiah 23:3
On the vast waters came the grain of the Nile; her harvest was the revenue of Tyre, and she was the marketplace of the nations.

## Isaiah 23:4
Be ashamed, Sidon, for the sea has spoken, the stronghold of the sea, saying, “I have neither been in labour nor given birth; I have neither raised young men nor brought up daughters.”

## Isaiah 23:5
When the news reaches Egypt, they will be in distress at the news of Tyre.

## Isaiah 23:6
Journey to Tarshish; lament, you inhabitants of the coast.

## Isaiah 23:7
Is this your city of joy, whose origin is from ancient times, whose feet carried her to settle in distant lands?

## Isaiah 23:8
Who has devised this against Tyre, the crown-giver, whose merchants were princes, whose traders were honoured across the earth?

## Isaiah 23:9
The Lord of Hosts has purposed it, to defile the pride of all splendour, to humble all who are honoured on the earth.

## Isaiah 23:10
Overflow your land like the Nile, Daughter of Tarshish, for you no longer have restraint.

## Isaiah 23:11
The Lord has stretched out his hand over the sea, he has made kingdoms tremble; he has given a command concerning Canaan to destroy its fortresses.

## Isaiah 23:12
He has declared, “You shall no longer exult, O crushed virgin daughter of Sidon. Arise, cross over to Cyprus; even there you will find no rest.”

## Isaiah 23:13
Look at the land of the Chaldeans—this is the people that was not; Assyria appointed it for desert creatures—they set up their siege towers, stripped its palaces, and made it a ruin.

## Isaiah 23:14
Lament, you ships of Tarshish, for your stronghold is destroyed.

## Isaiah 23:15
In that time Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years, like the days of one king. At the end of seventy years, it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the harlot:

## Isaiah 23:16
“Take up a harp, go around the city, you forgotten harlot; play the harp well, sing many songs, so that you may be remembered.”

## Isaiah 23:17
At the end of seventy years, the Lord will attend to Tyre. She will return to her trade and will engage in commerce with all the kingdoms on the face of the earth.

## Isaiah 23:18
Yet her earnings and her wages will be set apart for the Lord; they will not be stored or hoarded, but her profits will provide abundant food and splendid clothing for those who dwell in the presence of the Lord.
