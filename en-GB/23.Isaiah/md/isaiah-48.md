# Isaiah Chapter 48

## Isaiah 48:1
“Hear this, descendants of Jacob, you who are called by the name of Israel and have come forth from the waters of Judah, who swear by the name of the Lord and invoke the God of Israel— but not in truth or righteousness—

## Isaiah 48:2
For you name yourselves after the holy city and rely on the God of Israel; the Lord of Armies is His name:

## Isaiah 48:3
I declared the former things long ago; they came out of My mouth, and I made them known. Suddenly I acted, and they came to pass.

## Isaiah 48:4
Because I knew how obstinate you are, your neck is an iron sinew and your forehead bronze,

## Isaiah 48:5
Therefore I told you these things long ago; before they happened I announced them to you so that you could not say, ‘My idol did them; my carved image and my cast metal image ordained them.’

## Isaiah 48:6
You have heard these things; observe them all. Will you not declare it? From now on I will tell you of new things, hidden things unknown to you.

## Isaiah 48:7
They are created now, and not long ago; you have not heard of them before today, so you cannot say, ‘Yes, I knew them.’

## Isaiah 48:8
You have neither heard nor understood; from of old your ear has not been open. I knew you would deal very treacherously; you have been called a rebel from birth.

## Isaiah 48:9
For the sake of My name I delay My wrath; for My praise I restrain it for you, so as not to cut you off.

## Isaiah 48:10
Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver; I have tested you in the furnace of affliction.

## Isaiah 48:11
For My own sake, for My own sake, I do this. How can My name be profaned? I will not give My glory to another.

## Isaiah 48:12
“Pay attention to Me, Jacob, Israel whom I have called: I am the One; I am the first, and I am the last.

## Isaiah 48:13
My own hand laid the foundations of the earth, and My right hand spread out the heavens; when I call to them, they stand up together.

## Isaiah 48:14
Assemble, all of you, and listen: Who among them has declared these things? The Lord’s chosen ally will carry out His purpose against Babylon; His arm will be against the Chaldeans.

## Isaiah 48:15
I, even I, have spoken; indeed I have called him. I have brought him, and he will succeed in his mission.

## Isaiah 48:16
“Come near to Me and listen to this: From the beginning I have not spoken in secret; from the time it happens, I am there.” And now the Sovereign Lord has sent Me, endowed with His Spirit.

## Isaiah 48:17
This is what the Lord says— your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: “I am the Lord your God, who teaches you to benefit, who directs you in the way you should go.

## Isaiah 48:18
If only you had paid attention to My commandments, your peace would have been like a river, and your righteousness like the waves of the sea.

## Isaiah 48:19
Your descendants would have been like the sand, your offspring like its numberless grains; their name would never be blotted out nor destroyed from My presence.”

## Isaiah 48:20
Leave Babylon, flee from the Chaldeans! Announce this with shouts of joy and proclaim it. Send it out to the ends of the earth; say, “The Lord has redeemed His servant Jacob.”

## Isaiah 48:21
They did not suffer thirst when He guided them through the deserts; He made water flow for them from the rock; He split the rock, and water gushed out.

## Isaiah 48:22
“There is no peace for the wicked,” says the Lord.
