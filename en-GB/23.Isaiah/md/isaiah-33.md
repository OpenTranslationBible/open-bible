# Isaiah Chapter 33

## Isaiah 33:1  
Woe to you, destroyer,  
While you were not destroyed;  
And he who is treacherous, while others did not deal treacherously with him.  
As soon as you finish destroying, you will be destroyed;  
As soon as you stop dealing treacherously, others will deal treacherously with you.

## Isaiah 33:2  
Lord, be gracious to us; we have waited for You.  
Be their strength every morning,  
Our salvation also in the time of distress.

## Isaiah 33:3  
At the sound of a roar, peoples flee;  
At the lifting up of Yourself, nations scatter.

## Isaiah 33:4  
Your plunder is gathered as the caterpillar gathers;  
Like an infestation of locusts, people storm it.

## Isaiah 33:5  
The Lord is exalted, for He dwells on high;  
He has filled Zion with justice and righteousness.

## Isaiah 33:6  
And He will be the stability of your times,  
A wealth of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge;  
The fear of the Lord is his treasure.

## Isaiah 33:7  
Behold, their brave men cry out in the streets,  
The ambassadors of peace weep bitterly.

## Isaiah 33:8  
The highways are desolate,  
The traveler has ceased,  
He has broken the covenant,  
He has despised the cities,  
He has no regard for mankind.

## Isaiah 33:9  
The land mourns and wastes away,  
Lebanon is shamed and withers;  
Sharon is like a desert plain,  
And Bashan and Carmel lose their foliage.

## Isaiah 33:10  
“Now I will arise,” says the Lord,  
“Now I will be exalted, now I will be lifted up.

## Isaiah 33:11  
You have conceived chaff, you will give birth to stubble;  
My breath will consume you like a fire.

## Isaiah 33:12  
The peoples will be burned to lime,  
Like cut thorns which are burned in the fire.

## Isaiah 33:13  
You who are far away, hear what I have done;  
And you who are near, acknowledge My might.”

## Isaiah 33:14  
Sinners in Zion are terrified;  
Trembling has seized the godless.  
“Who among us can live with the consuming fire?  
Who among us can live with everlasting burning?”

## Isaiah 33:15  
One who walks righteously and speaks with integrity,  
One who rejects unjust gain,  
And shakes his hands so that they hold no bribe;  
One who stops his ears from hearing about bloodshed,  
And shuts his eyes from looking at evil;

## Isaiah 33:16  
He will dwell on the heights,  
His refuge will be the impregnable rock;  
His bread will be given him,  
His water will be sure.

## Isaiah 33:17  
Your eyes will see the King in His beauty;  
They will see a distant land.

## Isaiah 33:18  
Your heart will meditate on terror:  
“Where is one who counts?  
Where is one who weighs?  
Where is one who counts the towers?”

## Isaiah 33:19  
You will no longer see a fierce people,  
A people of unintelligible speech which no one comprehends,  
Of a stammering tongue which no one understands.

## Isaiah 33:20  
Look at Zion, the city of our appointed feasts;  
Your eyes will see Jerusalem,  
A peaceful settlement, a tent that will not be pulled up;  
Its stakes will never be pulled out,  
Nor any of its ropes be torn apart.

## Isaiah 33:21  
But there the majestic One, the Lord, will be for us  
A place of rivers and wide canals  
On which no boat with oars will go,  
And on which no mighty ship will pass—

## Isaiah 33:22  
For the Lord is our judge,  
The Lord is our lawgiver,  
The Lord is our king;  
He will save us—

## Isaiah 33:23  
Your sail is slack; it cannot hold the base of its mast firmly,  
Nor spread out the sail.  
Then the prey of an abundant spoil will be divided;  
Those who limp will take the plunder.

## Isaiah 33:24  
And no resident will say, “I am sick”;  
The people who live there will be forgiven their wrongdoing.
