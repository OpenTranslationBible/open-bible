# Isaiah Chapter 46

## Isaiah 46:1  
Bel has bowed down, Nebo stoops over;  
Their images are consigned to the animals and the cattle.  
The things that you carry are burdensome,  
A load for the weary animal.

## Isaiah 46:2  
They stooped over, they have bowed down together;  
They could not rescue the burden,  
But have themselves gone into captivity.

## Isaiah 46:3  
Listen to Me, house of Jacob,  
And all the remnant of the house of Israel,  
You who have been carried by Me from birth  
And have been carried from the womb;

## Isaiah 46:4  
Even to your old age I will be the same,  
And even to your graying years I will carry you!  
I have done it, and I will bear you;  
I will carry you and I will save you.

## Isaiah 46:5  
To whom would you liken Me  
And make Me equal, and compare Me,  
That we would be alike?

## Isaiah 46:6  
Those who lavish gold from the bag  
And weigh silver on the scale,  
Hire a goldsmith, and he makes it into a god;  
They bow down, they also worship it.

## Isaiah 46:7  
They lift it on the shoulder, carry it,  
And set it in its place, and it stands there.  
It does not move from its place.  
Though one may shout to it, it cannot answer;  
It cannot save him from his distress.

## Isaiah 46:8  
Remember this, and be assured;  
Recall it to mind, you wrongdoers.

## Isaiah 46:9  
Remember the former things long past,  
For I am God, and there is no other;  
I am God, and there is no one like Me,

## Isaiah 46:10  
Declaring the end from the beginning,  
And from ancient times things which have not been done,  
Saying, ‘My plan will be established,  
And I will accomplish all My good pleasure’;

## Isaiah 46:11  
Calling a bird of prey from the east,  
The man of My purpose from a distant country.  
Truly I have spoken; truly I will bring it to pass.  
I have planned it, I will certainly do it.

## Isaiah 46:12  
Listen to Me, you stubborn-minded,  
Who are far from righteousness.

## Isaiah 46:13  
I bring near My righteousness, it is not far off;  
And My salvation will not delay.  
And I will grant salvation in Zion,  
And My glory for Israel.
