# Isaiah Chapter 36

## Isaiah 36:1
In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah's reign, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, advanced against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them.

## Isaiah 36:2
The king of Assyria sent his chief officer from Lachish to Jerusalem to King Hezekiah with a substantial army. He halted by the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road to the Launderer’s Field.

## Isaiah 36:3
Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph, the recorder, went out to meet him.

## Isaiah 36:4
The chief officer said to them, “Say to Hezekiah: ‘This is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says: What is this confidence you have?

## Isaiah 36:5
You claim to have strategy and strength for war, but these are mere words. On whom do you rely, that you have rebelled against me?

## Isaiah 36:6
Behold, you rely on Egypt, that broken reed of a staff, which pierces the hand of anyone who leans on it. Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him.

## Isaiah 36:7
But if you say to me, “We trust in the Lord our God,” is it not He whose high places and altars Hezekiah removed, commanding Judah and Jerusalem, “You must worship before this altar”?

## Isaiah 36:8
“‘Now, make a deal with my master, the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses, if you can provide riders for them!

## Isaiah 36:9
How then can you repel even one officer of the least of my master’s servants, when you rely on Egypt for chariots and horsemen?

## Isaiah 36:10
Moreover, have I come up against this land to destroy it without the Lord’s approval? The Lord himself said to me, “Go up against this land and destroy it.”’”

## Isaiah 36:11
Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the chief officer, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it. Do not speak to us in Judean in the hearing of the people on the wall.”

## Isaiah 36:12
But the chief officer replied, “Has my master sent me to speak these words only to your master and to you, and not to the men sitting on the wall, who, like you, will have to eat their own dung and drink their own urine?”

## Isaiah 36:13
Then the chief officer stood and called out loudly in Judean, “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!

## Isaiah 36:14
This is what the king says: Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he cannot deliver you.

## Isaiah 36:15
Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to trust in the Lord by saying, ‘The Lord will surely deliver us; this city will not fall into the hand of the king of Assyria.’

## Isaiah 36:16
Do not listen to Hezekiah. This is what the king of Assyria says: Make peace with me and come out to me. Then each of you will eat from his own vine and fig tree and drink water from his own cistern,

## Isaiah 36:17
until I come and take you to a land like your own, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.

## Isaiah 36:18
Do not let Hezekiah mislead you by saying, ‘The Lord will deliver us.’ Have any of the gods of the nations delivered their lands from the hand of the king of Assyria?

## Isaiah 36:19
Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Have they delivered Samaria from my hand?

## Isaiah 36:20
Who among all the gods of these lands have delivered their land from my hand, that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem from my hand?”

## Isaiah 36:21
But the people remained silent and did not answer him a word, for the king had commanded, “Do not answer him.”

## Isaiah 36:22
Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, Shebna the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and reported to him the words of the chief officer.
