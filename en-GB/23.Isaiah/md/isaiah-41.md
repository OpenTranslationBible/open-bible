# Isaiah Chapter 41

## Isaiah 41:1  
“Listen to Me in silence, you coastlands,  
And let the peoples gain new strength;  
Let them come forward, then let them speak;  
Let us come together for judgment.

## Isaiah 41:2  
Who has stirred one from the east  
Whom He calls in righteousness to His feet?  
He hands nations over to him  
And subdues kings.  
He makes them like dust with his sword,  
Like wind-driven chaff with his bow.

## Isaiah 41:3  
He pursues them, passing on in peace,  
By a way he had not been before.

## Isaiah 41:4  
Who has performed and accomplished it,  
Calling the generations from the beginning?  
‘I, the Lord, am the first, and with the last—I am He.’”

## Isaiah 41:5  
The coastlands have seen and are afraid;  
The ends of the earth tremble;  
They have approached and have come.

## Isaiah 41:6  
Each one helps his neighbor  
And says to his brother, “Be strong!”

## Isaiah 41:7  
So the craftsman encourages the smelter,  
And he who smooths metal with the hammer encourages him who beats the anvil,  
Saying of the soldering, “It is good”;  
And he fastens it with nails, so that it will not totter.

## Isaiah 41:8  
“But you, Israel, My servant,  
Jacob whom I have chosen,  
Descendant of Abraham My friend,

## Isaiah 41:9  
You whom I have taken from the ends of the earth,  
And called from its remotest parts  
And said to you, ‘You are My servant,  
I have chosen you and have not rejected you.

## Isaiah 41:10  
Do not fear, for I am with you;  
Do not be afraid, for I am your God.  
I will strengthen you, I will also help you,  
I will also uphold you with My righteous right hand.’

## Isaiah 41:11  
Behold, all those who are angered at you will be shamed and dishonored;  
Those who contend with you will be as nothing and will perish.

## Isaiah 41:12  
You will seek those who quarrel with you, but will not find them;  
Those who war with you will be as nothing, as non-existent.

## Isaiah 41:13  
For I am the Lord your God who takes hold of your right hand,  
Who says to you, ‘Do not fear, I will help you.’

## Isaiah 41:14  
Do not fear, you worm Jacob, you people of Israel;  
I will help you,” declares the Lord,  
“And your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.

## Isaiah 41:15  
Behold, I have made you into a new, sharp threshing sledge with double edges;  
You will thresh the mountains and pulverize them,  
And make the hills like chaff.

## Isaiah 41:16  
You will winnow them, and the wind will carry them away,  
And a strong wind will scatter them;  
But you will rejoice in the Lord,  
You will boast in the Holy One of Israel.

## Isaiah 41:17  
The poor and needy are seeking water, but there is none,  
And their tongues are parched with thirst;  
I, the Lord, will answer them Myself,  
As the God of Israel I will not forsake them.

## Isaiah 41:18  
I will open rivers on the bare heights,  
And springs in the midst of the valleys;  
I will make the wilderness a pool of water  
And the dry land fountains of water.

## Isaiah 41:19  
I will put the cedar in the wilderness,  
The acacia, the myrtle, and the olive tree;  
I will place the juniper in the desert,  
Together with the box tree and the cypress,

## Isaiah 41:20  
So that they may see and recognize,  
And consider and gain insight as well,  
That the hand of the Lord has done this,  
And the Holy One of Israel has created it.

## Isaiah 41:21  
“Present your case,” the Lord says.  
“Bring forward your evidence,” the King of Jacob says.

## Isaiah 41:22  
Let them bring them forward and declare to us what is going to take place;  
As for the former events, declare what they were,  
So that we may consider them and know their outcome.  
Or announce to us what is coming;

## Isaiah 41:23  
Declare the things that are going to come afterward,  
So that we may know that you are gods;  
Indeed, do good or evil,  
That we may be afraid and fear together.

## Isaiah 41:24  
Behold, you are less than nothing,  
And your work is less than nothing;  
He who chooses you is an abomination.

## Isaiah 41:25  
I have put one from the north into motion, and he has come;  
From the rising of the sun he will call on My name;  
And he will come upon officials as upon mortar,  
As the potter treads clay.

## Isaiah 41:26  
Who has declared this from the beginning, so that we would know,  
Or from earlier times, so that we would say, “He was right”?  
There was no one at all who declared,  
There was no one at all who proclaimed,  
There was no one at all who heard your words.

## Isaiah 41:27  
Previously I said to Zion, “Behold, here they are.”  
And to Jerusalem I will provide a messenger of good news.

## Isaiah 41:28  
But when I look, there is no one,  
And there is no counselor among them,  
Who, if I ask, can give an answer.

## Isaiah 41:29  
Behold, all of them are false;  
Their works are nothing,  
Their cast metal images are wind and emptiness.
