# Isaiah Chapter 4

## Isaiah 4:1  
For seven women will take hold of one man on that day, saying,  
“We will eat our own bread and wear our own clothes,  
Only let us be called by your name;  
Take away our disgrace!”

## Isaiah 4:2  
On that day the Branch of the Lord will be beautiful and glorious,  
And the fruit of the earth will be the pride and beauty  
Of the survivors of Israel.

## Isaiah 4:3  
And it will come about that the one who is left in Zion and remains behind in Jerusalem  
Will be called holy—  
Everyone who is recorded for life in Jerusalem.

## Isaiah 4:4  
When the Lord has washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion  
And purged the bloodshed of Jerusalem from her midst,  
By the spirit of judgment and the spirit of burning,

## Isaiah 4:5  
Then the Lord will create over the entire area of Mount Zion  
And over her assemblies  
A cloud by day, and smoke,  
And the brightness of a flaming fire by night;  
For over all the glory will be a canopy.

## Isaiah 4:6  
And there will be a shelter to give shade from the heat by day,  
And refuge and protection from the storm and the rain.
