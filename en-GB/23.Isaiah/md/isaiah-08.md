# Isaiah Chapter 8

## Isaiah 8:1

The Lord said to me, “Take a large tablet and inscribe on it with ordinary letters: Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz.”

## Isaiah 8:2

I summoned Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberekiah as trustworthy witnesses for myself.

## Isaiah 8:3

I approached the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. The Lord instructed me, “Call him Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz.

## Isaiah 8:4

For before the child knows how to say ‘My father’ or ‘My mother,’ the riches of Damascus and the spoils of Samaria will be taken away by the king of Assyria.”

## Isaiah 8:5

The Lord spoke to me again:

## Isaiah 8:6

“Because this people have rejected the gently flowing waters of Shiloah and delight in Rezin and the son of Remaliah,

## Isaiah 8:7

therefore the Lord is about to bring upon them the powerful and overflowing waters of the Euphrates— the king of Assyria with all his splendour. It will rise above all its channels and overflow all its banks.

## Isaiah 8:8

It will sweep through Judah, flooding and passing through; it will reach up to the neck. Its outspread wings will cover the breadth of your land, O Immanuel.”

## Isaiah 8:9

Be shattered, O nations, and be broken! Listen, all distant lands. Prepare for battle, but be broken! Prepare for battle, but be broken!

## Isaiah 8:10

Devise a plan, but it will come to nothing; propose a strategy, but it will not succeed, for God is with us.

## Isaiah 8:11

This is what the Lord said to me with a strong hand upon me, warning me not to follow the way of this people:

## Isaiah 8:12

“Do not call conspiracy everything this people calls a conspiracy; do not fear what they fear, nor be in dread of it.

## Isaiah 8:13

The Lord of Hosts is the one you are to regard as holy; He is the one you are to fear, He is the one you are to dread.

## Isaiah 8:14

He will be a sanctuary; but for both houses of Israel, He will be a stone that causes people to stumble and a rock that makes them fall. For the people of Jerusalem, He will be a trap and a snare.

## Isaiah 8:15

Many will stumble over it, fall and be broken, be snared and captured.”

---

## Isaiah 8:16

Bind up the testimony and seal the law among my disciples.

## Isaiah 8:17

I will wait for the Lord, who is hiding His face from the house of Jacob. I will hope in Him.

## Isaiah 8:18

Here am I, and the children the Lord has given me. We are signs and symbols in Israel from the Lord of Hosts, who dwells on Mount Zion.

## Isaiah 8:19

When people say to you, “Consult mediums and spiritists who whisper and mutter,” should not a people inquire of their God? Why consult the dead on behalf of the living?

## Isaiah 8:20

Look to the law and the testimony! If they do not speak in alignment with this word, it is because they lack light.

## Isaiah 8:21

They will roam through the land, distressed and hungry; when they are famished, they will become enraged and, looking upward, will curse their king and their God.

## Isaiah 8:22

Then they will look to the earth and see only distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish; and they will be thrust into utter darkness.
