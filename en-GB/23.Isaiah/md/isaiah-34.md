# Isaiah Chapter 34

## Isaiah 34:1
Draw near, you nations, and listen; pay heed, you peoples! Let the earth and all it contains hear, the world and all that springs forth from it.

## Isaiah 34:2
For the Lord's indignation is upon all nations, and His fury upon all their armies. He has utterly destroyed them, He has delivered them to slaughter.

## Isaiah 34:3
Their slain shall be cast out, and their corpses will emit a stench; the mountains shall be soaked with their blood.

## Isaiah 34:4
All the stars of the heavens shall fade away, and the sky shall be rolled up like a scroll; all its host shall wither as leaves wither from the vine, or as shrivelled figs from the fig tree.

## Isaiah 34:5
For My sword has been sated in the heavens; behold, it shall descend in judgment upon Edom, upon the people I have devoted to destruction.

## Isaiah 34:6
The sword of the Lord is drenched in blood, and covered with fat, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams. For the Lord has a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.

## Isaiah 34:7
Wild oxen shall fall with them, and young bulls with mighty ones; their land shall be drenched with blood, and their dust shall be greasy with fat.

Its streams shall be turned into pitch, and its dust into burning sulphur; its land shall become blazing pitch.

## Isaiah 34:10
It shall not be quenched night nor day; its smoke shall ascend forever. From generation to generation it shall lie desolate; none shall pass through it forever and ever.

The pelican and the hedgehog shall possess it; the owl and the raven shall dwell there. He shall stretch over it the line of chaos and the plumb line of desolation.

## Isaiah 34:12
Its nobles shall have nothing there to be called a kingdom, and all its princes shall vanish away.

## Isaiah 34:13
Thorns shall overrun its citadels, nettles and brambles its strongholds; it shall become a haunt for jackals, a dwelling for ostriches.

## Isaiah 34:14
Desert creatures shall meet with hyenas, and wild goats shall call to each other; there the night-bird shall also settle and find for herself a resting place.

## Isaiah 34:15
The tree snake shall make its nest there and lay eggs, and hatch them, and gather them under its shadow; there also the hawks shall gather, each with its mate.

## Isaiah 34:16
Seek from the book of the Lord, and read: Not one of these shall be missing, none shall lack its mate. For His mouth has commanded, and His Spirit has gathered them.

## Isaiah 34:17
He has cast the lot for them, and His hand has divided it to them by measure. They shall possess it forever; from generation to generation they shall dwell in it.
