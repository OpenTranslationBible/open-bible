# Isaiah Chapter 58

## Isaiah 58:1  
Cry loudly, do not hold back;  
Raise your voice like a trumpet,  
And declare to My people their wrongdoing,  
And to the house of Jacob their sins.

## Isaiah 58:2  
Yet they seek Me day by day and delight to know My ways,  
As a nation that has done righteousness  
And has not forsaken the ordinance of their God.  
They ask Me for just decisions,  
They delight in the nearness of God.

## Isaiah 58:3  
‘Why have we fasted and You do not see?  
Why have we humbled ourselves and You do not notice?’  
Behold, on the day of your fast you find your desire,  
And oppress all your workers.

## Isaiah 58:4  
Behold, you fast for contention and strife,  
And to strike with a wicked fist.  
You do not fast like you have done today  
To make your voice heard on high.

## Isaiah 58:5  
Is it a fast like this that I choose, a day for a person to humble himself?  
Is it for bowing one’s head like a reed  
And for spreading out sackcloth and ashes as a bed?  
Will you call this a fast, even an acceptable day to the Lord?

## Isaiah 58:6  
Is this not the fast that I choose:  
To release the bonds of wickedness,  
To undo the ropes of the yoke,  
And to let the oppressed go free,  
And break every yoke?

## Isaiah 58:7  
Is it not to break your bread with the hungry  
And bring the homeless poor into the house;  
When you see the naked, to cover him;  
And not to hide yourself from your own flesh?

## Isaiah 58:8  
Then your light will break out like the dawn,  
And your recovery will spring up quickly;  
And your righteousness will go before you;  
The glory of the Lord will be your rear guard.

## Isaiah 58:9  
Then you will call, and the Lord will answer;  
You will cry for help, and He will say, “Here I am.”  
If you remove the yoke from your midst,  
The pointing of the finger and speaking wickedness,

## Isaiah 58:10  
And if you offer yourself to the hungry  
And satisfy the need of the afflicted,  
Then your light will rise in darkness,  
And your gloom will become like midday.

## Isaiah 58:11  
And the Lord will continually guide you,  
And satisfy your desire in scorched places,  
And give strength to your bones;  
And you will be like a watered garden,  
And like a spring of water whose waters do not fail.

## Isaiah 58:12  
Those from among you will rebuild the ancient ruins;  
You will raise up the age-old foundations;  
And you will be called the repairer of the breach,  
The restorer of the streets in which to dwell.

## Isaiah 58:13  
If, because of the Sabbath, you restrain your foot  
From doing as you wish on My holy day,  
And call the Sabbath a pleasure,  
And the holy day of the Lord honorable,  
And honor it, desisting from your own ways,  
From seeking your own pleasure  
And speaking your own word,

## Isaiah 58:14  
Then you will take delight in the Lord,  
And I will make you ride on the heights of the earth;  
And I will feed you with the heritage of your father Jacob,  
For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.
