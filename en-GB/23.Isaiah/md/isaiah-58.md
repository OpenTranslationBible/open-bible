# Isaiah Chapter 58

## Isaiah 58:1
“Cry out loudly, do not hold back; Raise your voice like a trumpet, and declare to My people their rebellion, and to the house of Jacob their sins.

## Isaiah 58:2
For day by day they seek Me out and delight to know My ways, as if they were a nation that practises righteousness and has not abandoned the ordinance of their God. They ask Me for just decisions and delight in the nearness of God.

## Isaiah 58:3
‘Why have we fasted,’ they say, ‘and You have not seen? Why have we humbled ourselves, and You have not noticed?’ Behold, on the day of your fasting, you pursue your own desires and oppress all your workers.

## Isaiah 58:4
Your fasting leads to contention and strife, and to striking each other with wicked fists. You cannot fast as you do today and expect your voice to be heard on high.

## Isaiah 58:5
Is this the kind of fast I have chosen, a day for a person to humble themselves? Is it only for bowing one’s head like a reed and for spreading out sackcloth and ashes? Will you call this a fast, an acceptable day to the Lord?

## Isaiah 58:6
Is this not the fast I have chosen: to release the chains of injustice, to undo the ropes of the yoke, to let the oppressed go free, and to break every yoke?

## Isaiah 58:7
Is it not to share your bread with the hungry and bring the homeless poor into your house; when you see the naked, to cover them, and not to hide yourself from your own flesh and blood?

## Isaiah 58:8
Then your light will break forth like the dawn, and your healing will quickly appear; your righteousness will go before you, and the glory of the Lord will be your rear guard.

## Isaiah 58:9
Then you will call, and the Lord will answer; you will cry for help, and He will say, ‘Here I am.’ If you remove the yoke from your midst, the pointing finger and malicious talk,

## Isaiah 58:10
and if you offer yourself to the hungry and satisfy the needs of the afflicted, then your light will rise in the darkness, and your gloom will become like midday.

## Isaiah 58:11
The Lord will continually guide you, and satisfy your needs in a sun-scorched land, and strengthen your bones. You will be like a well-watered garden, like a spring whose waters do not fail.

## Isaiah 58:12
Your people will rebuild the ancient ruins; you will raise up the age-old foundations; you will be called the Repairer of Broken Walls, the Restorer of Streets to Dwell In.

## Isaiah 58:13
“If you refrain from breaking the Sabbath and from doing as you please on My holy day, if you call the Sabbath a delight and the Lord’s holy day honourable, and if you honour it by not going your own way or seeking your own pleasure or speaking idle words,

## Isaiah 58:14
then you will find your joy in the Lord, and I will cause you to ride on the heights of the earth and to feast on the heritage of your father Jacob.” For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.
