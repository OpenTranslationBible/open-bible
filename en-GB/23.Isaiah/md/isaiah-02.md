## Isaiah 2:3

Many peoples will come and say, “Come, let us ascend to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob. He will instruct us in His ways, so that we may walk in His paths.” For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.

For the Lord of Hosts has a day of reckoning against all that is proud and lofty, against all that is exalted, and they will be humbled,

## Isaiah 2:13

against all the cedars of Lebanon, tall and proud, and against all the oaks of Bashan,

## Isaiah 2:14

against all the towering mountains and all the high hills,

## Isaiah 2:15

against every lofty tower and every strong wall,

## Isaiah 2:16

against all the ships of Tarshish and against all the stately vessels.
