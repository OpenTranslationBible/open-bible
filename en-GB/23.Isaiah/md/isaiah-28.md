# Isaiah Chapter 28

## Isaiah 28:1
Woe to the proud crown of Ephraim's drunkards, and to the fading flower of its glorious beauty, which is set on the head of a fertile valley, of those who are overcome with wine!

## Isaiah 28:2
Behold, the Lord has a strong and mighty one. Like a hailstorm and a tempest of destruction, like a storm of mighty overflowing waters, he will cast it down to the earth with force.

## Isaiah 28:3
The proud crown of Ephraim's drunkards will be trampled underfoot.

## Isaiah 28:4
The fading flower of its glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fertile valley, will be like the first-ripe fig before the summer; as soon as someone sees it, while it is still in their hand, they swallow it.

## Isaiah 28:5
In that day, the Lord Almighty will be a beautiful crown and a glorious diadem for the remnant of his people.

## Isaiah 28:6
He will be a spirit of justice to the one who sits in judgment, and a source of strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate.

## Isaiah 28:7
These also stagger from wine and reel from intoxicating drink: the priest and the prophet stagger from drink, they are confused by wine, they stagger from intoxicating drink; they reel while having visions, they stumble when rendering decisions.

## Isaiah 28:8
All the tables are covered with vomit; there is not a clean spot anywhere.

## Isaiah 28:9
“To whom is he trying to teach knowledge, and to whom is he explaining the message? To children just weaned from milk, to those just taken from the breast?

## Isaiah 28:10
For it is: Order on order, order on order, line on line, line on line, a little here, a little there.”

## Isaiah 28:11
Indeed, with stammering lips and a foreign tongue, God will speak to this people,

## Isaiah 28:12
to whom he declared, “This is the resting place; let the weary find rest,” and, “This is the place of repose,” but they would not listen.

## Isaiah 28:13
So the word of the Lord to them will be: Order on order, order on order, line on line, line on line, a little here, a little there, so that they may go and fall backward, be broken, snared, and captured.

## Isaiah 28:14
Therefore, hear the word of the Lord, you scoffers who rule this people in Jerusalem.

## Isaiah 28:15
Because you have said, “We have made a covenant with death, and with Sheol we have made an agreement. When the overwhelming scourge passes through, it will not reach us, for we have made falsehood our refuge and concealed ourselves with deception.”

## Isaiah 28:16
Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: “Behold, I lay a stone in Zion, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone for a sure foundation; the one who believes in it will not be disturbed.

## Isaiah 28:17
I will make justice the measuring line and righteousness the plumb line; hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, and waters will overflow the hiding place.

## Isaiah 28:18
Your covenant with death will be annulled, and your agreement with Sheol will not stand; when the overwhelming scourge passes through, you will be trampled by it.

## Isaiah 28:19
As often as it passes through, it will seize you; morning after morning, by day and by night, it will sweep through. The understanding of this message will bring sheer terror.

## Isaiah 28:20
The bed is too short to stretch out on, and the blanket too narrow to wrap oneself in.

## Isaiah 28:21
For the Lord will rise up as he did at Mount Perazim, he will be stirred as in the Valley of Gibeon, to do his work, his strange work, and to perform his task, his alien task.

## Isaiah 28:22
Now stop your mocking, or your shackles will be made heavier; for I have heard from the Lord God of hosts of decisive destruction upon the whole land.

## Isaiah 28:23
Listen and hear my voice; be attentive and heed my words.

## Isaiah 28:24
Does the farmer plough continually to plant seed? Does he continually turn and break up his ground?

## Isaiah 28:25
When he has levelled its surface, does he not sow dill and scatter cumin, and plant wheat in rows, barley in its place, and rye in its area?

## Isaiah 28:26
God instructs him and guides him in the right way.

## Isaiah 28:27
Dill is not threshed with a sledge, nor is the cartwheel driven over cumin; but dill is beaten out with a rod, and cumin with a stick.

## Isaiah 28:28
Grain must be crushed to make bread; one does not continue to thresh it forever. Though the wheels of a cart may be rolled over it, one does not use horses to grind grain.

## Isaiah 28:29
All this also comes from the Lord of hosts, whose counsel is wonderful and whose wisdom is great.
