# Isaiah Chapter 28

## Isaiah 28:1  
Woe to the proud crown of the habitually drunk of Ephraim,  
And to the fading flower of its glorious beauty,  
Which is at the head of the fertile valley  
Of those who are overcome with wine!

## Isaiah 28:2  
Behold, the Lord has a strong and mighty agent;  
As a storm of hail, a tempest of destruction,  
Like a storm of mighty overflowing waters,  
He has thrown it down to the earth with His hand.

## Isaiah 28:3  
The proud crown of the habitually drunk of Ephraim is trampled underfoot.

## Isaiah 28:4  
And the fading flower of its glorious beauty,  
Which is at the head of the fertile valley,  
Will be like the first-ripe fig prior to summer,  
Which one sees,  
And as soon as it is in his hand, he swallows it.

## Isaiah 28:5  
On that day the Lord of armies will become a beautiful crown  
And a glorious wreath to the remnant of His people;

## Isaiah 28:6  
A spirit of justice for him who sits in judgment,  
A strength to those who repel the onslaught at the gate.

## Isaiah 28:7  
And these also reel with wine and stagger from intoxicating drink:  
The priest and the prophet reel with intoxicating drink,  
They are confused by wine, they stagger from intoxicating drink;  
They reel while having visions, they stagger when rendering judgment.

## Isaiah 28:8  
For all the tables are full of filthy vomit, without a single clean place.

## Isaiah 28:9  
To whom would He teach knowledge,  
And to whom would He interpret the message?  
Those just weaned from milk?  
Those taken from the breast?

## Isaiah 28:10  
For He says,  
“Order on order, order on order,  
Line on line, line on line,  
A little here, a little there.”

## Isaiah 28:11  
Indeed, He will speak to this people  
Through stammering lips and a foreign tongue,

## Isaiah 28:12  
He who said to them,  
“Here is rest, give rest to the weary,”  
And, “Here is repose,” but they would not listen.

## Isaiah 28:13  
So the word of the Lord to them will be,  
“Order on order, order on order,  
Line on line, line on line,  
A little here, a little there,”  
So that they may go and stumble backward, be broken, snared, and taken captive.

## Isaiah 28:14  
Therefore, hear the word of the Lord, you scoffers,  
Who rule this people who are in Jerusalem,

## Isaiah 28:15  
Because you have said, “We have made a covenant with death,  
And with Sheol we have made a pact.  
The gushing flood will not reach us when it passes by,  
Because we have made falsehood our refuge and we have concealed ourselves with deception.”

## Isaiah 28:16  
Therefore this is what the Lord God says:  
“Behold, I am laying a stone in Zion, a tested stone,  
A precious cornerstone for the foundation, firmly placed.  
The one who believes in it will not be disturbed.

## Isaiah 28:17  
I will make justice the measuring line  
And righteousness the level;  
Then hail will sweep away the refuge of lies,  
And the waters will overflow the secret place.

## Isaiah 28:18  
Your covenant with death will be canceled,  
And your pact with Sheol will not stand;  
When the gushing flood passes through,  
Then you will become its trampling ground.

## Isaiah 28:19  
As often as it passes through, it will seize you;  
For morning after morning it will pass through, anytime during the day or night,  
And it will be sheer terror to understand what it means.”

## Isaiah 28:20  
The bed is too short on which to stretch out,  
And the blanket is too small to wrap oneself in.

## Isaiah 28:21  
For the Lord will rise up as at Mount Perazim,  
He will be stirred up as in the valley of Gibeon,  
To do His task, His unusual task,  
And to work His work, His extraordinary work.

## Isaiah 28:22  
And now do not carry on as scoffers,  
Or your shackles will be made stronger;  
For I have heard from the Lord God of armies  
Of decisive destruction on all the earth.

## Isaiah 28:23  
Listen and hear my voice,  
Pay attention and hear my words.

## Isaiah 28:24  
Does the farmer plow continually to plant seed?  
Does he continually turn and break up his ground?

## Isaiah 28:25  
Does he not level its surface  
And sow dill and scatter cumin  
And plant wheat in rows,  
Barley in its place and rye within its area?

## Isaiah 28:26  
For his God instructs and teaches him properly.

## Isaiah 28:27  
For dill is not threshed with a threshing sledge,  
Nor is the cartwheel driven over cumin;  
But dill is beaten out with a rod,  
And cumin with a club.

## Isaiah 28:28  
Grain for bread is crushed,  
Indeed, he does not continue to thresh it forever.  
Because the wheel of his cart and his horses eventually damage it,  
He does not thresh it longer.

## Isaiah 28:29  
This also comes from the Lord of armies,  
Who has made His counsel wonderful and His wisdom great.
