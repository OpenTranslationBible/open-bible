# Isaiah Chapter 6

## Isaiah 6:1
In the year that King Uzziah passed away, I saw the Lord seated on a throne, high and exalted, with the train of His robe filling the temple.

## Isaiah 6:2
Above Him stood the seraphim, each having six wings: with two they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they flew.

## Isaiah 6:3
And they called out to one another, saying, “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of His glory.”

## Isaiah 6:4
At the sound of their voices, the foundations of the thresholds shook, and the temple was filled with smoke.

## Isaiah 6:5
Then I said, “Woe is me, for I am undone! For I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell among a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts.”

## Isaiah 6:6
Then one of the seraphim flew to me holding a live coal, which he had taken with tongs from the altar.

## Isaiah 6:7
He touched my mouth with it and said, “See, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away and your sin is atoned for.”

## Isaiah 6:8
Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?” And I said, “Here I am. Send me!”

## Isaiah 6:9
He said, “Go and tell this people: ‘Keep on hearing, yet do not understand; keep on seeing, yet do not perceive.’

## Isaiah 6:10
Make the heart of this people callous, make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed.”

## Isaiah 6:11
Then I asked, “For how long, Lord?” And He replied, “Until the cities are laid waste and without inhabitant, the houses are deserted and the fields are ruined and ravaged,

## Isaiah 6:12
until the Lord has removed people far away, and the land is utterly desolate.

## Isaiah 6:13
And though a tenth remains in it, it will again be subject to burning, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump remains when it is felled. The holy seed is its stump.”
