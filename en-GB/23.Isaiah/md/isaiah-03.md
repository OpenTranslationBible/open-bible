# Isaiah Chapter 3

## Isaiah 3:1  
For behold, the Lord God of armies is going to remove from Jerusalem and Judah  
Both supply and support,  
The entire supply of bread,  
And the entire supply of water;

## Isaiah 3:2  
The mighty man and the warrior,  
The judge and the prophet,  
The diviner and the elder,

## Isaiah 3:3  
The captain of fifty and the esteemed person,  
The counsellor and the expert artisan,  
And the skillful enchanter.

## Isaiah 3:4  
And I will make mere boys their leaders,  
And mischievous children will rule over them,

## Isaiah 3:5  
And the people will be oppressed,  
Each one by another, and each one by his neighbour;  
The youth will assault the elder,  
And the inferior against the honourable.

## Isaiah 3:6  
When a man lays hold of his brother in the house of his father, saying,  
“You have a cloak, you shall be our ruler,  
And these ruins will be under your authority,”

## Isaiah 3:7  
On that day he will protest, saying,  
“I will not be your healer,  
For in my house there is neither bread nor cloak;  
You should not appoint me ruler of the people.”

## Isaiah 3:8  
For Jerusalem has stumbled and Judah has fallen,  
Because their speech and their actions are against the Lord,  
To rebel against His glorious presence.

## Isaiah 3:9  
The expression of their faces testifies against them,  
And they display their sin like Sodom;  
They do not even conceal it.  
Woe to them, for they have brought evil on themselves!

## Isaiah 3:10  
Tell the righteous that it will go well for them,  
For they will eat the fruit of their actions.

## Isaiah 3:11  
Woe to the wicked! It will go badly for him,  
For what he deserves will be done to him.

## Isaiah 3:12  
My people! Their oppressors treat them violently,  
And women rule over them.  
My people! Those who guide you lead you astray  
And confuse the direction of your paths.

## Isaiah 3:13  
The Lord arises to contend,  
And stands to judge the people.

## Isaiah 3:14  
The Lord enters into judgment with the elders and leaders of His people,  
“It is you who have consumed the vineyard;  
The goods stolen from the poor are in your houses.

## Isaiah 3:15  
What do you mean by crushing My people  
And oppressing the face of the poor?”  
Declares the Lord God of armies.

## Isaiah 3:16  
Moreover, the Lord said,  
“Because the daughters of Zion are haughty  
And walk with heads held high and seductive eyes,  
And go along with mincing steps  
And jingle the anklets on their feet,

## Isaiah 3:17  
Therefore the Lord will afflict the scalp of the daughters of Zion with scabs,  
And the Lord will expose their secret foreheads.”

## Isaiah 3:18  
On that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets, headbands, crescent ornaments,

## Isaiah 3:19  
Dangling earrings, bracelets, veils,

## Isaiah 3:20  
Headdresses, ankle chains, sashes, perfume boxes, amulets,

## Isaiah 3:21  
Finger rings, nose rings,

## Isaiah 3:22  
Festive robes, outer garments, shawls, purses,

## Isaiah 3:23  
Papyrus garments, undergarments, headbands, and veils.

## Isaiah 3:24  
Now it will come about that instead of balsam oil there will be a stench;  
Instead of a belt, a rope;  
Instead of well-set hair, a plucked-out scalp;  
Instead of fine clothes, a robe of burlap;  
And branding instead of beauty.

## Isaiah 3:25  
Your men will fall by the sword  
And your mighty ones in battle.

## Isaiah 3:26  
And her gates will lament and mourn,  
And she will sit deserted on the ground.
