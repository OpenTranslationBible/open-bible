# Isaiah Chapter 3

## Isaiah 3:1

Behold, the Lord, the God of hosts, is about to withdraw from Jerusalem and Judah both sustenance and support: the entire provision of bread and the entire provision of water;

## Isaiah 3:2

The mighty man and the warrior, the judge and the prophet, the soothsayer and the elder,

## Isaiah 3:3

The captain of fifty and the man of distinction, the counsellor and the skilled craftsman, and the expert enchanter.

## Isaiah 3:4

"I will appoint mere lads as their leaders, and unruly children shall govern them."

## Isaiah 3:5

And the people will be oppressed, each by another and each by his neighbour; the youth will rise against the elder, and the lowly against the honoured.

## Isaiah 3:6

When a man takes hold of his brother in his father's house, saying, "You have a cloak, you shall be our leader; take charge of this heap of ruins!"

## Isaiah 3:7

On that day he will protest, saying, "I will not be your healer, for in my house there is neither bread nor cloak; do not appoint me as leader of the people."

## Isaiah 3:8

For Jerusalem has stumbled and Judah has fallen, because their words and deeds are against the Lord, to defy His glorious presence.

## Isaiah 3:9

The expression on their faces testifies against them; they flaunt their sin like Sodom; they do not even attempt to hide it. Woe to them! For they have brought calamity upon themselves.

## Isaiah 3:10

Say to the righteous that it shall be well with them, for they will enjoy the fruit of their actions.

## Isaiah 3:11

Woe to the wicked! It will go ill for him, for what his hands have done shall be done to him.

## Isaiah 3:12

My people! Their oppressors are children, and women rule over them. My people, those who guide you lead you astray and misdirect your paths.

## Isaiah 3:13

The Lord takes His stand to contend, and rises to judge the people.

## Isaiah 3:14

The Lord enters into judgment with the elders and leaders of His people: "It is you who have ravaged my vineyard; the spoils from the poor are in your houses.

## Isaiah 3:15

What do you mean by crushing My people and grinding the faces of the poor?" declares the Lord, the God of hosts.

## Isaiah 3:16

Moreover, the Lord says, "Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with outstretched necks and seductive eyes, mincing as they go, and jingling their anklets,

## Isaiah 3:17

The Lord will afflict the scalps of the daughters of Zion with sores, and the Lord will make their foreheads bare."

## Isaiah 3:18

On that day the Lord will take away the splendour of their anklets, headbands, and crescent ornaments,

## Isaiah 3:19

the dangling earrings, bracelets, and veils,

## Isaiah 3:20

the headdresses, ankle chains, sashes, perfume bottles, and amulets,

## Isaiah 3:21

the rings of authority and adornments for the nose,

## Isaiah 3:22

the festive robes, outer garments, shawls, and purses,

## Isaiah 3:23

and the fine linen garments, turbans, and veils.

## Isaiah 3:24

And it shall come to pass that instead of fragrance there will be a stench; instead of a belt, a rope; instead of well-set hair, baldness; instead of fine clothing, sackcloth; and branding instead of beauty.

## Isaiah 3:25

Your men shall meet their fate by the sword, and your warriors shall fall in battle.

## Isaiah 3:26

And her gates shall lament and mourn, and she shall sit desolate on the ground.
