# Isaiah Chapter 1

## Isaiah 1:1
The vision of Isaiah, son of Amoz, concerning Judah and Jerusalem, which he saw during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.

## Isaiah 1:2
Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth; for the Lord has spoken: “I have raised children and brought them up, but they have rebelled against Me.

## Isaiah 1:3
The ox knows its owner, and the donkey its master’s manger, but Israel does not know; My people do not understand.”

## Isaiah 1:4
Woe to the sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, offspring of evildoers, children who act corruptly! They have forsaken the Lord, they have despised the Holy One of Israel, they have turned away from Him.

## Isaiah 1:5
Why should you be stricken again, as you continue in your rebellion? The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.

## Isaiah 1:6
From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it, only bruises, welts, and raw wounds; not pressed out, nor bandaged, nor soothed with oil.

## Isaiah 1:7
Your land is desolate, your cities are burned with fire; your fields are being devoured by strangers right in front of you; it is desolate, as overthrown by foreigners.

## Isaiah 1:8
The daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, like a hut in a cucumber field, like a city under siege.

## Isaiah 1:9
If the Lord of Hosts had not left us a few survivors, we would have become like Sodom, we would have been like Gomorrah.

## Isaiah 1:10
Hear the word of the Lord, you rulers of Sodom; listen to the instruction of our God, you people of Gomorrah!

## Isaiah 1:11
“What are your many sacrifices to Me?” says the Lord. “I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of well-fed cattle; I take no pleasure in the blood of bulls, lambs, or goats.

## Isaiah 1:12
When you come to appear before Me, who has required this from you, this trampling of My courts?

## Isaiah 1:13
Bring no more meaningless offerings; incense is an abomination to Me. New moons, Sabbaths, and convocations—I cannot endure iniquity and solemn assembly.

## Isaiah 1:14
Your new moon festivals and your appointed feasts My soul hates; they have become a burden to Me; I am weary of bearing them.

## Isaiah 1:15
When you spread out your hands in prayer, I will hide My eyes from you; even though you make many prayers, I will not listen. Your hands are full of blood.

## Isaiah 1:16
Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean. Remove the evil of your deeds from My sight. Cease to do evil,

## Isaiah 1:17
Learn to do good; seek justice, correct the oppressor; defend the fatherless, plead for the widow.

## Isaiah 1:18
“Come now, let us reason together,” says the Lord. “Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall be like wool.

## Isaiah 1:19
If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land;

## Isaiah 1:20
but if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured by the sword.” For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.

## Isaiah 1:21
How the faithful city has become a harlot! She who was full of justice! Righteousness once lodged in her, but now murderers.

## Isaiah 1:22
Your silver has become dross, your wine mixed with water.

## Isaiah 1:23
Your rulers are rebels and companions of thieves; everyone loves bribes and pursues rewards. They do not defend the fatherless, nor does the widow’s case come before them.

## Isaiah 1:24
Therefore the Lord, the Lord of Hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, declares: “Ah, I will get relief from My adversaries and avenge Myself on My enemies.

## Isaiah 1:25
I will turn My hand against you, and thoroughly purge away your dross, and remove all your impurities.

## Isaiah 1:26
I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counsellors as at the beginning. Afterward you shall be called the City of Righteousness, the Faithful City.”

## Isaiah 1:27
Zion shall be redeemed with justice, and her repentant ones with righteousness.

## Isaiah 1:28
But rebels and sinners shall be broken together, and those who forsake the Lord shall be consumed.

## Isaiah 1:29
For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired, and you shall be embarrassed by the gardens that you have chosen.

## Isaiah 1:30
For you shall be like an oak whose leaf fades, and like a garden without water.

## Isaiah 1:31
The strong man shall become tinder, and his work a spark; both shall burn together, with no one to quench the fire.
