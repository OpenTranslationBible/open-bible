# Isaiah Chapter 18

## Isaiah 18:1
Woe to the land of whirring wings that lies beyond the rivers of Cush,

## Isaiah 18:2
which sends envoys by sea in papyrus vessels over the waters. Go, swift messengers, to a nation tall and smooth-skinned, to a people feared far and wide, a powerful and aggressive nation whose land is divided by rivers.

## Isaiah 18:3
All you inhabitants of the world, you who dwell on the earth, when a banner is raised on the mountains, you will see it, and when the trumpet is sounded, you will hear it.

## Isaiah 18:4
For this is what the Lord has said to me: “I will remain quiet and observe from my dwelling place, like shimmering heat in the sunshine, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.”

## Isaiah 18:5
For before the harvest, when the blossom is gone and the flower becomes a ripening grape, he will cut off the shoots with pruning knives, and remove and take away the spreading branches.

## Isaiah 18:6
They will be left together for the mountain birds of prey and for the wild animals; the birds will feed on them all summer, and the wild animals will feed on them all winter.

## Isaiah 18:7
At that time gifts of tribute will be brought to the Lord Almighty from a people tall and smooth-skinned, from a people feared far and wide, a powerful and aggressive nation, whose land is divided by rivers— to the place of the Name of the Lord Almighty, to Mount Zion.
