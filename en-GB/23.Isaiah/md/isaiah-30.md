# Isaiah Chapter 30

## Isaiah 30:1
“Woe to the stubborn children,” declares the Lord, “who execute plans that are not mine, and forge alliances not of my Spirit, adding sin upon sin;

## Isaiah 30:2
who go down to Egypt without consulting me, seeking refuge in Pharaoh’s protection and shelter in Egypt’s shadow.

## Isaiah 30:3
But Pharaoh’s protection will be your shame, and the shelter in Egypt’s shadow your disgrace.

## Isaiah 30:4
For though their officials are in Zoan and their envoys have reached Hanes,

## Isaiah 30:5
everyone will be ashamed because of a people that do not benefit them, bringing neither help nor advantage, only shame and disgrace.”

## Isaiah 30:6
A prophecy concerning the beasts of the Negev: Through a land of hardship and distress, of lions and lionesses, of vipers and darting snakes, they carry their riches on donkeys’ backs, their treasures on camels’ humps, to a people who will not profit them;

## Isaiah 30:7
to Egypt, whose help is utterly futile. Therefore I have called her Rahab the Do-Nothing.

## Isaiah 30:8
Go now, write it on a tablet before them, inscribe it on a scroll, that it may serve as an everlasting witness in the days to come.

## Isaiah 30:9
For these are a rebellious people, deceitful children, children unwilling to listen to the Lord’s instruction.

## Isaiah 30:10
They say to the seers, “See no more visions!” and to the prophets, “Do not prophesy the truth to us. Speak to us pleasant things, prophesy illusions.

## Isaiah 30:11
Leave us alone, turn away from the path, and cease confronting us with the Holy One of Israel!”

## Isaiah 30:12
Therefore this is what the Holy One of Israel says: “Since you have rejected this message and relied on oppression and deceit, and depended on them,

## Isaiah 30:13
this sin will become for you like a breach in a high wall, bulging and about to collapse, whose fall comes suddenly, in an instant.

## Isaiah 30:14
It will break in pieces like pottery, shattered so ruthlessly that not a fragment will be found among its pieces to take coals from a hearth or to scoop water from a cistern.”

## Isaiah 30:15
This is what the Sovereign Lord, the Holy One of Israel, says: “In repentance and rest is your salvation, in quietness and trust is your strength, but you were not willing.

## Isaiah 30:16
You said, ‘No, we will flee on horses.’ Therefore you will flee! You said, ‘We will ride on swift horses.’ Therefore your pursuers will be swift!

## Isaiah 30:17
A thousand will flee at the threat of one; at the threat of five you will all flee away, until you are left like a flagstaff on a mountaintop, like a banner on a hill.”

## Isaiah 30:18
Yet the Lord longs to be gracious to you; therefore he will rise to show you compassion. For the Lord is a God of justice. Blessed are all who wait for him!

## Isaiah 30:19
People of Zion, who dwell in Jerusalem, you will weep no more. How gracious he will be when you cry for help! As soon as he hears, he will answer you.

## Isaiah 30:20
Although the Lord gives you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, your Teacher will no longer hide himself; your eyes will see your Teacher.

## Isaiah 30:21
Wherever you turn, your ears will hear a voice behind you, saying, “This is the way; walk in it.”

## Isaiah 30:22
Then you will desecrate your idols overlaid with silver and your images covered with gold; you will throw them away like a filthy thing and say to them, “Be gone!”

## Isaiah 30:23
He will also send rain for the seed you sow in the ground, and the food that comes from the land will be rich and plentiful. On that day your livestock will graze in broad pastures.

## Isaiah 30:24
The oxen and donkeys that work the soil will eat seasoned feed, spread out with fork and shovel.

## Isaiah 30:25
On every high mountain and lofty hill there will be streams of water on the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.

## Isaiah 30:26
The light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be seven times brighter, like the light of seven days, when the Lord binds up the bruises of his people and heals the wounds he inflicted.

## Isaiah 30:27
Behold, the name of the Lord comes from afar, with burning anger and dense clouds of smoke; his lips are full of wrath, and his tongue is like a consuming fire.

## Isaiah 30:28
His breath is like an overflowing river, reaching up to the neck, to shake the nations in the sieve of destruction, and to place in the jaws of the peoples a bridle that leads them astray.

## Isaiah 30:29
You will have songs as in the night when you celebrate a holy festival; your hearts will rejoice as when people playing pipes go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the Rock of Israel.

## Isaiah 30:30
The Lord will cause his majestic voice to be heard and will make them see his arm coming down with furious anger and consuming fire, with cloudburst, thunderstorm, and hailstones.

## Isaiah 30:31
At the voice of the Lord, Assyria will be shattered; he will strike them with his rod.

## Isaiah 30:32
Every blow the Lord lays on them with his punishing club will be to the music of tambourines and lyres, as he fights them in battle with the blows of his arm.

## Isaiah 30:33
For Topheth has long been prepared; it has been made ready for the king. Its pyre is deep and wide, with an abundance of fire and wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of burning sulphur, sets it ablaze.
