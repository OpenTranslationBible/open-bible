# Isaiah Chapter 30

## Isaiah 30:1  
“Woe to the rebellious children,” declares the Lord,  
“Who execute a plan, but not Mine,  
And make an alliance, but not of My Spirit,  
In order to add sin to sin;

## Isaiah 30:2  
Who proceed down to Egypt  
Without consulting Me,  
To take refuge in the safety of Pharaoh,  
And to seek shelter in the shadow of Egypt!

## Isaiah 30:3  
Therefore the safety of Pharaoh will be your shame,  
And the shelter in the shadow of Egypt, your humiliation.

## Isaiah 30:4  
For their officials are at Zoan  
And their ambassadors arrive at Hanes.

## Isaiah 30:5  
Everyone will be ashamed because of a people who do not benefit them,  
Who are not a help or benefit, but a source of shame and also disgrace.”

## Isaiah 30:6  
The pronouncement concerning the animals of the Negev:  
Through a land of distress and anguish,  
From where come lioness and lion, viper and flying serpent,  
They carry their riches on the backs of young donkeys,  
And their treasures on camels’ humps,  
To a people who will not benefit them;

## Isaiah 30:7  
Even Egypt, whose help is vain and empty.  
Therefore, I have called her  
“Rahab who has been exterminated.”

## Isaiah 30:8  
Now go, write it on a tablet in their presence  
And inscribe it on a scroll,  
That it may serve in the time to come  
As a witness forever.

## Isaiah 30:9  
For this is a rebellious people,  
False sons,  
Sons who refuse to listen  
To the instruction of the Lord;

## Isaiah 30:10  
Who say to the seers, “You must not see visions”;  
And to the prophets, “You must not prophesy the truth to us.  
Speak to us pleasant words,  
Prophesy illusions.

## Isaiah 30:11  
Get out of the way, turn aside from the path,  
Stop speaking before us about the Holy One of Israel!”

## Isaiah 30:12  
Therefore this is what the Holy One of Israel says:  
“Since you have rejected this word  
And have put your trust in oppression and crookedness, and have relied on them,

## Isaiah 30:13  
Therefore this wrongdoing will be to you  
Like a breach about to fall,  
A bulge in a high wall,  
Whose collapse comes suddenly in an instant,

## Isaiah 30:14  
Whose collapse is like the smashing of a potter’s jar,  
So ruthlessly shattered  
That a shard will not be found among its pieces  
To take fire from a hearth  
Or to scoop water from a cistern.”

## Isaiah 30:15  
For this is what the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, has said:  
“In repentance and rest you will be saved,  
In quietness and trust is your strength.”  
But you were not willing,

## Isaiah 30:16  
And you said, “No, for we will flee on horses!”  
Therefore you shall flee!  
“And we will ride on swift horses!”  
Therefore those who pursue you shall be swift.

## Isaiah 30:17  
One thousand will flee at the threat of one man;  
You will flee at the threat of five,  
Until you are left like a signal post on a mountain top,  
And like a flag on a hill.

## Isaiah 30:18  
Therefore the Lord longs to be gracious to you,  
And therefore He waits on high to have compassion on you.  
For the Lord is a God of justice;  
How blessed are all those who long for Him.

## Isaiah 30:19  
For you, people in Zion, inhabitant in Jerusalem, you will weep no longer.  
He will certainly be gracious to you at the sound of your cry;  
When He hears it, He will answer you.

## Isaiah 30:20  
Although the Lord has given you bread of deprivation and water of oppression,  
He, your Teacher, will no longer hide Himself, but your eyes will see your Teacher.

## Isaiah 30:21  
And your ears will hear a word behind you, saying,  
“This is the way, walk in it,” whenever you turn to the right or to the left.

## Isaiah 30:22  
And you will desecrate your carved images plated with silver,  
And your cast metal images plated with gold.  
You will scatter them as a filthy thing,  
And say to them, “Be gone!”

## Isaiah 30:23  
Then He will give you rain for your seed which you will sow in the ground,  
And bread from the yield of the ground,  
And it will be rich and plentiful;  
On that day your livestock will graze in a spacious pasture.

## Isaiah 30:24  
Also the oxen and the donkeys that work the ground will eat seasoned feed,  
Which has been winnowed with shovel and pitchfork.

## Isaiah 30:25  
And on every lofty mountain and every high hill there will be streams running with water  
On the day of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.

## Isaiah 30:26  
And the light of the full moon will be like the light of the sun,  
And the light of the sun will be seven times brighter,  
Like the light of seven days,  
On the day the Lord binds up the fracture of His people and heals the wound He has inflicted.

## Isaiah 30:27  
Behold, the name of the Lord comes from a remote place;  
His anger is burning and dense with smoke;  
His lips are filled with indignation,  
And His tongue is like a consuming fire;

## Isaiah 30:28  
His breath is like an overflowing river,  
Which reaches to the neck,  
To shake the nations back and forth in a sieve,  
And to put in the jaws of the peoples the bridle that leads astray.

## Isaiah 30:29  
You will have songs as in the night when you keep the festival,  
And gladness of heart as when one marches to the sound of the flute,  
To go to the mountain of the Lord, to the Rock of Israel.

## Isaiah 30:30  
And the Lord will cause His voice of authority to be heard,  
And the descending of His arm to be seen in fierce anger,  
And in the flame of a consuming fire  
In cloudburst, downpour, and hailstones.

## Isaiah 30:31  
For at the voice of the Lord, Assyria will be terrified  
When He strikes with the rod.

## Isaiah 30:32  
And every blow of the rod of punishment  
Which the Lord will lay on him  
Will be with the music of tambourines and lyres;  
And in battles, brandishing weapons, He will fight them.

## Isaiah 30:33  
For Topheth has long been ready, indeed, it has been prepared for the king.  
He has made it deep and large,  
A pyre of fire with plenty of wood;  
The breath of the Lord, like a torrent of brimstone, sets it afire.
