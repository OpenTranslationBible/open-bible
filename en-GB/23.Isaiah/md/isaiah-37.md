# Isaiah Chapter 37

## Isaiah 37:1  
Now when King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth, and entered the house of the Lord.

## Isaiah 37:2  
Then he sent Eliakim, who was in charge of the household, Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz.

## Isaiah 37:3  
And they said to him, “This is what Hezekiah says: ‘This day is a day of distress, rebuke, and humiliation; for children have come to the point of birth, and there is no strength to deliver them.

## Isaiah 37:4  
Perhaps the Lord your God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to taunt the living God, and will avenge the words which the Lord your God has heard. Therefore, offer a prayer for the remnant that is left.’”

## Isaiah 37:5  
So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.

## Isaiah 37:6  
And Isaiah said to them, “This is what you shall say to your master: ‘This is what the Lord says: “Do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me.

## Isaiah 37:7  
Behold, I am going to put a spirit in him, so that he will hear news and return to his own land. And I will make him fall by the sword in his own land.”’”

## Isaiah 37:8  
Then Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, for he had heard that he had withdrawn from Lachish.

## Isaiah 37:9  
And he heard them say regarding Tirhakah king of Cush, “He has come out to fight against you.” When he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,

## Isaiah 37:10  
“Say this to Hezekiah king of Judah: ‘Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, “Jerusalem will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.”

## Isaiah 37:11  
Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands, destroying them completely. So will you be saved?

## Isaiah 37:12  
Did the gods of the nations whom my fathers destroyed save them? Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the sons of Eden who were in Telassar?

## Isaiah 37:13  
Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, and of Hena and Ivvah?’”

## Isaiah 37:14  
Then Hezekiah took the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it, and he went up to the house of the Lord and spread it out before the Lord.

## Isaiah 37:15  
Hezekiah prayed to the Lord, saying,

## Isaiah 37:16  
“Lord of armies, God of Israel, who is enthroned above the cherubim, You are the God, You alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You made heaven and earth.

## Isaiah 37:17  
Incline Your ear, Lord, and hear; open Your eyes, Lord, and see; and listen to all the words of Sennacherib, who sent them to taunt the living God.

## Isaiah 37:18  
Truly, Lord, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the countries and their lands,

## Isaiah 37:19  
and have thrown their gods into the fire, for they were not gods but only the work of human hands, wood and stone. So they have destroyed them.

## Isaiah 37:20  
But now Lord, our God, save us from his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You alone, Lord, are God.”

## Isaiah 37:21  
Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent word to Hezekiah, saying, “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel says: ‘Because you have prayed to Me about Sennacherib king of Assyria,

## Isaiah 37:22  
this is the word that the Lord has spoken against him:  
“She has shown contempt for you and mocked you, the virgin daughter of Zion;  
She has shaken her head behind you, the daughter of Jerusalem!

## Isaiah 37:23  
Whom have you taunted and blasphemed?  
And against whom have you raised your voice  
And haughtily raised your eyes?  
Against the Holy One of Israel!

## Isaiah 37:24  
Through your servants you have taunted the Lord,  
And you have said,  
‘With my many chariots I came up to the heights of the mountains,  
To the remotest parts of Lebanon;  
And I cut down its tall cedars and its choice junipers.  
And I will go to its highest peak, its thickest forest.

## Isaiah 37:25  
I dug wells and drank waters,  
And with the soles of my feet I dried up  
All the streams of Egypt.’

## Isaiah 37:26  
Have you not heard?  
Long ago I did it,  
From ancient times I planned it.  
Now I have brought it about,  
That you would turn fortified cities into ruinous heaps.

## Isaiah 37:27  
So their inhabitants were powerless,  
They were shattered and put to shame.  
They were like the vegetation of the field and the green herb,  
Like grass on the rooftops that is scorched before it has grown.

## Isaiah 37:28  
But I know your sitting down,  
Your going out and your coming in,  
And your raging against Me.

## Isaiah 37:29  
Because of your raging against Me,  
And because your arrogance has come up to My ears,  
I will put My hook in your nose  
And My bridle in your lips,  
And I will turn you back  
By the way that you came.

## Isaiah 37:30  
Then this shall be the sign for you: you will eat this year what grows of itself,  
In the second year what grows from that,  
But in the third year sow, reap, plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.

## Isaiah 37:31  
The surviving remnant of the house of Judah will again take root downward and bear fruit upward.

## Isaiah 37:32  
For out of Jerusalem a remnant will go,  
And out of Mount Zion survivors.  
The zeal of the Lord of armies will perform this.”’

## Isaiah 37:33  
Therefore, this is what the Lord says about the king of Assyria:  
“He will not come to this city, nor shoot an arrow there;  
And he will not come before it with a shield, nor heap up an assault ramp against it.

## Isaiah 37:34  
By the way that he came, by the same he will return,  
And he shall not come to this city,”’ declares the Lord.

## Isaiah 37:35  
“For I will protect this city to save it for My own sake, and for My servant David’s sake.”

## Isaiah 37:36  
Then the angel of the Lord went out and struck 185,000 in the camp of the Assyrians;  
And when the men rose early in the morning, behold, all the dead bodies!

## Isaiah 37:37  
So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and returned home, and lived in Nineveh.

## Isaiah 37:38  
It came about, as he was worshiping in the house of his god Nisroch,  
That his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with the sword;  
And they escaped into the land of Ararat.  
And his son Esarhaddon became king in his place.
