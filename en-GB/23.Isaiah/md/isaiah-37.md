# Isaiah Chapter 37

## Isaiah 37:1
When King Hezekiah received the report, he tore his garments, donned sackcloth, and went into the house of the Lord.

## Isaiah 37:2
He sent Eliakim, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, all clothed in sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz.

## Isaiah 37:3
They said to him, “This is what Hezekiah says: ‘This day is one of distress, rebuke, and humiliation, like when children come to the point of birth, but there is no strength to bring them forth.

## Isaiah 37:4
Perhaps the Lord your God will hear the words of the field commander, whom his master, the king of Assyria, has sent to mock the living God, and will rebuke the words which the Lord your God has heard. Therefore, pray for the remnant that remains.’”

## Isaiah 37:5
So the servants of King Hezekiah went to Isaiah.

## Isaiah 37:6
Isaiah said to them, “This is what you shall say to your master: ‘This is what the Lord says: Do not be afraid of the words you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.

## Isaiah 37:7
Behold, I will put a spirit in him, so that when he hears a certain report, he will return to his own land, and there I will cause him to fall by the sword.’”

## Isaiah 37:8
When the field commander returned, he found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, for he had heard that the king had left Lachish.

## Isaiah 37:9
Now Sennacherib heard concerning Tirhakah, king of Cush, “He has set out to fight against you.” On hearing this, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,

## Isaiah 37:10
“This is what you shall say to Hezekiah king of Judah: ‘Do not let your God, in whom you trust, deceive you by saying, “Jerusalem will not be delivered into the hands of the king of Assyria.”

## Isaiah 37:11
Surely you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, destroying them completely. Will you then be delivered?

## Isaiah 37:12
Did the gods of the nations that my forefathers destroyed deliver them—Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Telassar?

## Isaiah 37:13
Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, or the kings of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?’”

## Isaiah 37:14
Hezekiah took the letter from the messengers and read it. Then he went up to the house of the Lord and spread it out before the Lord.

## Isaiah 37:15
And Hezekiah prayed to the Lord, saying,

## Isaiah 37:16
“O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, who is enthroned above the cherubim, you alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth.

## Isaiah 37:17
Incline your ear, O Lord, and hear; open your eyes, O Lord, and see; and listen to all the words Sennacherib has sent to mock the living God.

## Isaiah 37:18
Truly, O Lord, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations and their lands,

## Isaiah 37:19
and have cast their gods into the fire, for they were no gods, but the work of human hands, wood and stone. Thus they were destroyed.

## Isaiah 37:20
Now, O Lord our God, deliver us from his hand, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you alone, O Lord, are God.”

## Isaiah 37:21
Then Isaiah, son of Amoz, sent a message to Hezekiah, saying, “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘Because you have prayed to me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria,

## Isaiah 37:22
this is the word the Lord has spoken against him: “The virgin daughter of Zion despises you and mocks you; the daughter of Jerusalem shakes her head at you as you flee.

## Isaiah 37:23
Whom have you taunted and blasphemed? And against whom have you raised your voice and lifted your eyes in pride? Against the Holy One of Israel!

## Isaiah 37:24
By your servants you have mocked the Lord, and you have said, ‘With my many chariots I have ascended the heights of the mountains, to the farthest recesses of Lebanon. I have cut down its tallest cedars, its choicest junipers. I have reached its remotest heights, its densest forest.

## Isaiah 37:25
I have dug wells and drunk waters, and with the sole of my feet I have dried up all the streams of Egypt.’

## Isaiah 37:26
Have you not heard? Long ago I ordained it. In days of old I planned it; now I have brought it to pass, that you should turn fortified cities into heaps of ruins.

## Isaiah 37:27
Their inhabitants, drained of power, are dismayed and confounded. They are like plants in the field, like tender green shoots, like grass on the housetops, scorched before it grows up.

## Isaiah 37:28
But I know your sitting down, your going out and coming in, and your raging against me.

## Isaiah 37:29
Because of your raging against me and your arrogance that has reached my ears, I will put my hook in your nose and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way you came.

## Isaiah 37:30
“This shall be the sign for you: This year you will eat what grows by itself, and the second year what springs from that. But in the third year sow and reap, plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.

## Isaiah 37:31
The remnant of the house of Judah shall again take root below and bear fruit above.

## Isaiah 37:32
For out of Jerusalem will come a remnant, and out of Mount Zion a band of survivors. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will accomplish this.

## Isaiah 37:33
“Therefore, this is what the Lord says concerning the king of Assyria: ‘He will not enter this city or shoot an arrow there. He will not come before it with a shield or build a siege ramp against it.

## Isaiah 37:34
By the way that he came, he will return; he will not enter this city,’ declares the Lord.

## Isaiah 37:35
‘I will defend this city and save it, for my sake and for the sake of my servant David.’”

## Isaiah 37:36
Then the angel of the Lord went out and struck down 185,000 in the camp of the Assyrians. When the people arose early in the morning, behold, all these were dead bodies.

## Isaiah 37:37
So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and returned home, and he stayed in Nineveh.

## Isaiah 37:38
And it came to pass, while he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him down with the sword, and they escaped to the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his place.
