# Isaiah Chapter 45

## Isaiah 45:1

This is what the Lord says to His anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have grasped, to subdue nations before him and to loosen the armour of kings; to open doors before him so that gates will not be closed:

## Isaiah 45:2

I will go before you and make the rough places level; I will break down the gates of bronze and cut through the bars of iron.

## Isaiah 45:3

I will give you the treasures hidden in darkness and the riches stored in secret places, so that you may know that I am the Lord, the God of Israel, who calls you by name.

## Isaiah 45:4

For the sake of Jacob my servant, of Israel my chosen, I have called you by name and given you a title of honour, though you have not known me.

## Isaiah 45:5

I am the Lord, and there is no other; besides me there is no God. I will strengthen you, though you have not known me,

## Isaiah 45:6

so that from the rising of the sun to its setting people may know there is none besides me. I am the Lord, and there is no other.

## Isaiah 45:7

I create light and form darkness, I bring prosperity and allow challenges; I, the Lord, do all these things.

## Isaiah 45:8

Heavens above, rain down righteousness; let the clouds pour it down. Let the earth open wide, let salvation spring up, and let righteousness flourish with it; I, the Lord, have created it.

## Isaiah 45:9

Woe to those who quarrel with their Maker, those who are but potsherds among the potsherds on the ground. Does the clay say to the potter, ‘What are you making?’ Does your work say, ‘He has no hands’?

## Isaiah 45:10

Woe to those who question a father, ‘What have you begotten?’ or a mother, ‘What have you brought forth?’

## Isaiah 45:11

This is what the Lord says—the Holy One of Israel, and its Maker: Concerning things to come, do you question me about my children, or give me orders about the work of my hands?

## Isaiah 45:12

It is I who made the earth and created mankind upon it. My own hands stretched out the heavens; I marshalled their starry hosts.

## Isaiah 45:13

I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will make all his ways straight. He will rebuild my city and set my exiles free, but not for a price or reward, says the Lord Almighty.

## Isaiah 45:14

This is what the Lord says: The products of Egypt, the merchandise of Cush, and the tall Sabeans will come over to you and will be yours; they will walk behind you in chains. They will bow down before you and plead with you, saying, ‘Surely God is with you, and there is no other; there is no other god.’

## Isaiah 45:15

Truly, you are a God who hides himself, the God and Saviour of Israel.

## Isaiah 45:16

All those who craft idols will be put to shame and disgraced; they will depart together in dishonour.

## Isaiah 45:17

But Israel will be saved by the Lord with an everlasting salvation; you will not be put to shame or disgraced for all eternity.

## Isaiah 45:18

For this is what the Lord says—he who created the heavens, he is God; he who fashioned and made the earth, he established it; he did not create it to be empty, but formed it to be inhabited—he says: I am the Lord, and there is no other.

## Isaiah 45:19

I have not spoken in secret, from a hidden place in a land of darkness; I have not said to Jacob’s descendants, ‘Seek me in vain.’ I, the Lord, speak the truth; I declare what is right.

## Isaiah 45:20

Gather together and come; assemble, you fugitives from the nations. Ignorant are those who carry about idols of wood and pray to gods that cannot save.

## Isaiah 45:21

Declare and present your case; let them take counsel together. Who foretold this long ago, who declared it from the distant past? Was it not I, the Lord? And there is no God apart from me, a righteous God and a Saviour; there is none but me.

## Isaiah 45:22

Look to me for salvation, all the ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is no other.

## Isaiah 45:23

By myself I have sworn, my mouth has uttered in all integrity a word that will not be revoked: Before me every knee will bow, by me every tongue will swear allegiance.

## Isaiah 45:24

They will say of me, ‘In the Lord alone are righteousness and strength.’ All who have raged against him will come to him and be put to shame.

## Isaiah 45:25

In the Lord all the descendants of Israel will be justified and will boast.
