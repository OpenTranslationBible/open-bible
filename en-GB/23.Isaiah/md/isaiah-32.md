# Isaiah Chapter 32

## Isaiah 32:1  
Behold, a king will reign righteously,  
And officials will rule justly.

## Isaiah 32:2  
Each will be like a refuge from the wind  
And a shelter from the storm,  
Like streams of water in a dry country,  
Like the shade of a huge rock in an exhausted land.

## Isaiah 32:3  
Then the eyes of those who see will not be blinded,  
And the ears of those who hear will listen.

## Isaiah 32:4  
The mind of the rash will discern the truth,  
And the tongue of the stammerers will hurry to speak clearly.

## Isaiah 32:5  
No longer will the fool be called noble,  
Or the rogue be spoken of as generous.

## Isaiah 32:6  
For a fool speaks nonsense,  
And his heart inclines toward wickedness:  
To practice ungodliness and to speak error against the Lord,  
To keep the hungry person unsatisfied  
And to withhold drink from the thirsty.

## Isaiah 32:7  
As for a rogue, his weapons are evil;  
He devises wicked schemes  
To destroy the poor with lies,  
Even though the needy one speaks what is right.

## Isaiah 32:8  
But the noble person devises noble plans,  
And by noble plans he stands.

## Isaiah 32:9  
Rise up, you women who are at ease,  
And hear my voice;  
Listen to my word,  
You complacent daughters.

## Isaiah 32:10  
Within a year and a few days  
You will be troubled, you complacent women;  
For the grape harvest is ended,  
And the fruit gathering will not come.

## Isaiah 32:11  
Tremble, you women who are at ease;  
Be troubled, you complacent daughters;  
Strip, undress, and put sackcloth on your waist,

## Isaiah 32:12  
Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine,

## Isaiah 32:13  
For the land of my people in which thorns and briars will come up,  
Indeed, for all the joyful houses and for the jubilant city.

## Isaiah 32:14  
Because the palace has been abandoned,  
The populated city forsaken.  
Hill and watchtower have become caves forever,  
A delight for wild donkeys, a pasture for flocks,

## Isaiah 32:15  
Until the Spirit is poured out upon us from on high,  
And the wilderness becomes a fertile field,  
And the fertile field is considered as a forest.

## Isaiah 32:16  
Then justice will dwell in the wilderness,  
And righteousness will remain in the fertile field.

## Isaiah 32:17  
And the work of righteousness will be peace,  
And the service of righteousness, quietness and confidence forever.

## Isaiah 32:18  
Then my people will live in a peaceful settlement,  
In secure dwellings, and in undisturbed resting places;

## Isaiah 32:19  
And it will hail when the forest comes down,  
And the city will be utterly laid low.

## Isaiah 32:20  
How blessed you will be, you who sow beside all waters,  
Who let the ox and the donkey freely range.
