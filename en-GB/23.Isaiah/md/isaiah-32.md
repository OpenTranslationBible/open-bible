# Isaiah Chapter 32

## Isaiah 32:1
Observe, a king will govern with righteousness, and officials will administer justice.

## Isaiah 32:2
Each will serve as a shelter from the wind and a refuge from the storm, akin to streams of water in a dry land and the shade of a vast rock in a parched region.

## Isaiah 32:3
Then the eyes of those who see will not be closed, and the ears of those who hear will pay attention.

## Isaiah 32:4
The mind of the hasty will comprehend knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers will speak fluently and clearly.

## Isaiah 32:5
No longer will the fool be called noble, nor the rogue be regarded as generous.

## Isaiah 32:6
For fools utter folly, and their hearts are inclined towards wickedness: They engage in ungodliness and spread falsehoods about the Lord; they leave the hungry unsatisfied and withhold drink from the thirsty.

## Isaiah 32:7
The rogue uses wicked devices; he devises evil plans to ruin the poor with falsehoods, even when the needy speak what is right.

## Isaiah 32:8
But the noble person devises noble plans, and by noble deeds he stands.

## Isaiah 32:9
Arise, you women who are complacent, and listen to my voice; heed my words, you daughters who feel secure.

## Isaiah 32:10
In a little more than a year, you who feel secure will be troubled; the grape harvest will fail, and the fruit gathering will not occur.

## Isaiah 32:11
Tremble, you complacent women; be troubled, you daughters who feel at ease! Remove your fine garments and put on sackcloth.

## Isaiah 32:12
Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vines,

## Isaiah 32:13
and for the land of my people, overgrown with thorns and briarsâ€” yes, mourn for all the joyous houses and the jubilant city.

## Isaiah 32:14
For the palace will be forsaken, the bustling city deserted; hill and watchtower will become caves forever, a delight for wild donkeys, a pasture for flocks,

## Isaiah 32:15
until the Spirit is poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness becomes a fertile field, and the fertile field is deemed a forest.

## Isaiah 32:16
Then justice will inhabit the wilderness, and righteousness will dwell in the fertile field.

## Isaiah 32:17
The result of righteousness will be peace, and the effect of righteousness will be quietness and confidence forever.

## Isaiah 32:18
My people will reside in peaceful settlements, in secure homes, and in undisturbed resting places.

## Isaiah 32:19
And it will hail when the forest falls, and the city will be completely laid low.

## Isaiah 32:20
How blessed you will be, sowing your seed by all waters, and letting your cattle and donkeys roam freely.
