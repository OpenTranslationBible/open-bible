# Isaiah Chapter 57

## Isaiah 57:1
The righteous perish, and no one takes it to heart; the devout are taken away, with no one understanding that the righteous are removed to be spared from evil.

## Isaiah 57:2
They enter into peace; they rest in their beds, each one who walked uprightly.

## Isaiah 57:3
“But come here, you children of a sorceress, offspring of an adulterer and a prostitute!

## Isaiah 57:4
Whom are you mocking? Against whom do you open your mouth wide and stick out your tongue? Are you not a brood of rebels, offspring of deceit?

## Isaiah 57:5
You burn with lust among the oaks and under every luxuriant tree; you slaughter your children in the ravines, under the clefts of the rocks.

## Isaiah 57:6
Among the smooth stones of the ravines is your portion; they are your lot. Yes, to them you have poured out drink offerings and offered grain offerings. Should I relent concerning these things?

## Isaiah 57:7
You have set up your resting place on a high and elevated hill; there you ascended to present your sacrifices.

## Isaiah 57:8
Behind your doors and doorposts you have placed your pagan symbols. Forsaking me, you uncovered your bed, you climbed into it and opened it wide; you made a pact with those whose beds you love, and you gazed upon their nakedness.

## Isaiah 57:9
You journeyed to the king with olive oil and increased your perfumes; you sent your ambassadors far away and descended to Sheol.

## Isaiah 57:10
You wearied yourself with your many journeys, yet you did not say, ‘It is hopeless.’ You found renewal of your strength, so you did not faint.

## Isaiah 57:11
“Whom did you dread and fear so much that you have been unfaithful to me, and have neither remembered me nor taken it to heart? Is it not because I have been silent for a long time that you do not fear me?

## Isaiah 57:12
I will expose your righteousness and your deeds, and they will not profit you.

## Isaiah 57:13
When you cry out for help, let your collection of idols save you! The wind will carry them all off, a mere breath will blow them away. But whoever takes refuge in me will inherit the land and possess my holy mountain.”

## Isaiah 57:14
And it will be said: “Build up, build up, prepare the way! Remove the obstacles out of the way of my people.”

## Isaiah 57:15
For this is what the high and exalted One says— he who lives forever, whose name is holy: “I dwell in a high and holy place, but also with the contrite and lowly in spirit, to revive the spirit of the lowly and to revive the heart of the contrite.

## Isaiah 57:16
For I will not accuse forever, nor will I always be angry, for then the spirit would grow faint before me— the very breath of those I have made.

## Isaiah 57:17
Because of the iniquity of his unjust gain I was angry and struck him; I hid my face in anger, yet he continued turning away, in the way of his heart.

## Isaiah 57:18
I have seen his ways, but I will heal him; I will guide him and restore comfort to him and to his mourners,

## Isaiah 57:19
bringing forth praise on their lips. Peace, peace, to those far and near,” says the Lord. “And I will heal them.”

## Isaiah 57:20
But the wicked are like the tossing sea, which cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and mud.

## Isaiah 57:21
“There is no peace,” says my God, “for the wicked.”
