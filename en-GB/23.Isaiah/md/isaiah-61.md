# Isaiah Chapter 61

## Isaiah 61:1  
The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me,  
Because the Lord anointed me  
To bring good news to the humble;  
He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,  
To proclaim release to captives  
And freedom to prisoners,

## Isaiah 61:2  
To proclaim the favorable year of the Lord  
And the day of vengeance of our God;  
To comfort all who mourn,

## Isaiah 61:3  
To grant those who mourn in Zion,  
Giving them a garland instead of ashes,  
The oil of gladness instead of mourning,  
The cloak of praise instead of a disheartened spirit.  
So they will be called oaks of righteousness,  
The planting of the Lord, that He may be glorified.

## Isaiah 61:4  
Then they will rebuild the ancient ruins,  
They will raise up the former devastations;  
And they will repair the ruined cities,  
The desolations of many generations.

## Isaiah 61:5  
Strangers will stand and pasture your flocks,  
And foreigners will be your farmers and your vinedressers.

## Isaiah 61:6  
But you will be called the priests of the Lord;  
You will be spoken of as ministers of our God.  
You will eat the wealth of nations,  
And you will boast in their riches.

## Isaiah 61:7  
Instead of your shame you will have a double portion,  
And instead of humiliation they will shout for joy over their portion.  
Therefore they will possess a double portion in their land,  
Everlasting joy will be theirs.

## Isaiah 61:8  
For I, the Lord, love justice,  
I hate robbery in the burnt offering;  
And I will faithfully give them their reward,  
And make an everlasting covenant with them.

## Isaiah 61:9  
Then their descendants will be known among the nations,  
And their offspring among the peoples.  
All who see them will recognize them  
Because they are the descendants whom the Lord has blessed.

## Isaiah 61:10  
I will rejoice greatly in the Lord,  
My soul will be joyful in my God;  
For He has clothed me with garments of salvation,  
He has wrapped me with a robe of righteousness,  
As a groom puts on a turban,  
And as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.

## Isaiah 61:11  
For as the earth produces its sprouts,  
And as a garden causes the things sown in it to spring up,  
So the Lord God will cause righteousness and praise  
To spring up before all the nations.
