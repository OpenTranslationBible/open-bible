# Isaiah Chapter 61

## Isaiah 61:1
The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is upon me, because the Lord has anointed me to bring good news to the humble. He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release for the prisoners;

## Isaiah 61:2
to declare the favourable year of the Lord and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn,

## Isaiah 61:3
to provide for those who grieve in Zion, bestowing on them a garland instead of ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair. They will be called oaks of righteousness, a planting of the Lord for his splendour.

## Isaiah 61:4
They will rebuild the ancient ruins and raise up the former devastations; they will renew the ruined cities, the desolations of many generations.

## Isaiah 61:5
Strangers will tend your flocks, and foreigners will be your farmers and vinedressers.

## Isaiah 61:6
But you will be called priests of the Lord; you will be named ministers of our God. You will feed on the wealth of nations, and boast in their riches.

## Isaiah 61:7
Instead of your shame you will receive a double portion, and instead of disgrace they will shout for joy over their inheritance. Therefore, they will possess a double portion in their land, and everlasting joy will be theirs.

## Isaiah 61:8
For I, the Lord, love justice; I hate robbery and wrongdoing. In my faithfulness, I will reward them and make an everlasting covenant with them.

## Isaiah 61:9
Their offspring will be known among the nations, and their descendants among the peoples. All who see them will acknowledge that they are a people whom the Lord has blessed.

## Isaiah 61:10
I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul will exult in my God; for he has clothed me with garments of salvation and wrapped me in a robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom adorns his head like a priest, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.

## Isaiah 61:11
For as the earth brings forth its sprouts, and as a garden causes seeds to grow, so the Sovereign Lord will cause righteousness and praise to spring up before all nations.
