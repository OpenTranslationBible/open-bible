# Isaiah Chapter 59

## Isaiah 59:1
Indeed, the hand of the Lord is not too short to save, nor is His ear too dull to hear.

## Isaiah 59:2
But your wrongdoings have created a separation between you and your God; your sins have hidden His face from you so that He does not listen.

## Isaiah 59:3
For your hands are tainted with blood, and your fingers with wrongdoing. Your lips have spoken lies, and your tongue murmurs wickedness.

## Isaiah 59:4
No one calls for justice, nor does anyone plead honestly. They rely on empty arguments and speak falsehoods; they conceive trouble and give birth to disaster.

## Isaiah 59:5
They hatch viper eggs and weave a spider's web. Whoever eats their eggs dies, and from one that is crushed, a snake breaks out.

## Isaiah 59:6
Their webs cannot become clothing, nor can they cover themselves with what they make. Their deeds are acts of wrongdoing, and violence is in their hands.

## Isaiah 59:7
Their feet run to evil, and they are quick to shed innocent blood. Their thoughts are thoughts of wrongdoing; devastation and destruction are in their paths.

## Isaiah 59:8
They do not know the way of peace, and there is no justice in their tracks. They have made their paths crooked; whoever walks on them does not know peace.

## Isaiah 59:9
Therefore, justice is far from us, and righteousness does not reach us. We hope for light, but there is darkness; for brightness, but we walk in gloom.

## Isaiah 59:10
We grope along the wall like the blind, feeling our way like those without eyes. We stumble at midday as if it were twilight; among the strong, we are like the dead.

## Isaiah 59:11
We all growl like bears and moan sadly like doves. We look for justice, but find none; for salvation, but it is far from us.

## Isaiah 59:12
For our offences are many in Your sight, and our sins testify against us. Our wrongdoings are with us, and we acknowledge our iniquities:

## Isaiah 59:13
Rebellion and denial of the Lord, turning away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering lying words from the heart.

## Isaiah 59:14
Justice is driven back, and righteousness stands far away; truth has stumbled in the streets, and uprightness cannot enter.

## Isaiah 59:15
Truth is absent, and whoever shuns evil becomes a prey. The Lord saw, and it displeased Him that there was no justice.

## Isaiah 59:16
He saw that there was no one, and was amazed that there was no one to intercede; so His own arm brought salvation to Him, and His righteousness upheld Him.

## Isaiah 59:17
He put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation on His head; He clothed Himself with garments of vengeance and wrapped Himself in zeal as a cloak.

## Isaiah 59:18
According to their deeds, so will He repay: wrath to His adversaries, retribution to His enemies; He will repay the islands their due.

## Isaiah 59:19
So people will fear the name of the Lord from the west, and His glory from the rising of the sun, for He will come like a rushing stream driven by the breath of the Lord.

## Isaiah 59:20
“A Redeemer will come to Zion, to those in Jacob who turn from their sins,” declares the Lord.

## Isaiah 59:21
“As for Me, this is My covenant with them,” says the Lord: “My Spirit, which is upon you, and My words that I have put in your mouth will not depart from your mouth, nor from the mouth of your children, nor from the mouth of their descendants—from this time on and forever,” says the Lord.
