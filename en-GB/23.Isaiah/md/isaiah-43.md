everyone who is called by my name, whom I created for my glory, whom I formed and made.”

## Isaiah 43:9

## Isaiah 43:10
“You are my witnesses,” says the Lord, “and my servant whom I have chosen, so that you may know and believe me and understand that I am he. Before me no god was formed, nor will there be one after me.

## Isaiah 43:15
I am the Lord, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King.”

## Isaiah 43:16
This is what the Lord declares— He who makes a way through the sea and a path through the mighty waters,

## Isaiah 43:17
who brings out the chariot and horse, the army and the mighty man; they will lie down together and not rise again, extinguished, snuffed out like a wick:

## Isaiah 43:18
“Do not call to mind the former things, nor dwell on the past.

## Isaiah 43:19
Behold, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert.

The wild animals honour me, the jackals and the ostriches, because I provide water in the wilderness and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my chosen people,

## Isaiah 43:21
the people I formed for myself so that they may declare my praise.

## Isaiah 43:22
“Yet you have not called on me, Jacob; you have grown weary of me, Israel.

## Isaiah 43:23
You have not brought me sheep for burnt offerings, nor honoured me with your sacrifices. I have not burdened you with offerings nor wearied you with incense.

## Isaiah 43:24
You have not bought me sweet cane with money, nor satisfied me with the fat of your sacrifices; rather, you have burdened me with your sins and wearied me with your wrongdoings.

## Isaiah 43:25
“I, even I, am the one who blots out your transgressions for my own sake, and remembers your sins no more.

## Isaiah 43:26
Review the past with me, let us argue the matter together; state your case, so that you may be proved right.

## Isaiah 43:27
Your earliest ancestor sinned, and your representatives have rebelled against me.

## Isaiah 43:28
So I will disgrace the officials of the sanctuary, and I will consign Jacob to destruction and Israel to scorn.
