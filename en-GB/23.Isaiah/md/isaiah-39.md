# Isaiah Chapter 39

## Isaiah 39:1
At that time, Merodach-Baladan son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah, for he had heard of his illness and recovery.

## Isaiah 39:2
Hezekiah was delighted and showed them all that was in his storehouses—the silver, the gold, the spices, the fine olive oil—his entire armoury and everything found among his treasures. There was nothing in his palace or in all his kingdom that Hezekiah did not show them.

## Isaiah 39:3
Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and asked, “What did these men say, and from where did they come to you?” Hezekiah replied, “They came to me from a distant land, from Babylon.”

## Isaiah 39:4
The prophet asked, “What did they see in your palace?” Hezekiah answered, “They have seen everything in my palace; there is nothing among my treasures that I did not show them.”

## Isaiah 39:5
Isaiah then addressed Hezekiah, saying, “Listen to the message from the Lord of Hosts:

## Isaiah 39:6
‘Behold, the days are coming when everything in your palace, and all that your forefathers have stored up until this day, will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left,’ says the Lord.

## Isaiah 39:7
‘And some of your descendants, your own flesh and blood who will be born to you, will be taken away, and they will serve in the palace of the king of Babylon.’”

## Isaiah 39:8
Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The word of the Lord you have spoken is good.” For he thought, “There will be peace and security in my days.”
