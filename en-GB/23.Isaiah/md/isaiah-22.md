# Isaiah Chapter 22

## Isaiah 22:1
A proclamation concerning the Valley of Vision: What is troubling you now, that you have all ascended to the rooftops?

## Isaiah 22:2
You city full of noise, you tumultuous town, you city of jubilation. Your dead were not slain by the sword, nor did they perish in battle.

## Isaiah 22:3
All your leaders have fled together; they have been captured without the use of the bow. All of you who were discovered were taken captive together, even though you had fled far away.

## Isaiah 22:4
Therefore I said, “Look away from me; let me weep bitterly. Do not attempt to comfort me over the ruin of my people.”

## Isaiah 22:5
For the Lord, the God of hosts, has a day of panic, trampling, and confusion in the Valley of Vision, a day of breaking down walls and crying out to the mountains.

## Isaiah 22:6
Elam takes up the quiver, with chariots, infantry, and horsemen; Kir uncovers the shield.

## Isaiah 22:7
Your choicest valleys are filled with chariots, and horsemen have taken their positions at the city gates.

## Isaiah 22:8
The Lord has removed the protection of Judah, and on that day you looked to the weapons in the House of the Forest.

## Isaiah 22:9
You saw that the breaches in the walls of the City of David were many; you collected the waters of the Lower Pool.

## Isaiah 22:10
You counted the houses in Jerusalem and demolished houses to fortify the wall.

## Isaiah 22:11
You constructed a reservoir between the two walls for the waters of the Old Pool, but you did not look to the One who made it, nor did you consider the One who planned it long ago.

## Isaiah 22:12
On that day, the Lord, the God of hosts, called you to weeping, wailing, shaving your head, and wearing sackcloth.

## Isaiah 22:13
But instead, there is joy and revelry, slaughtering of cattle and killing of sheep, eating of meat and drinking of wine: “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we may die.”

## Isaiah 22:14
The Lord of hosts has revealed this in my hearing: “Surely this iniquity will not be forgiven you until you die,” says the Lord, the God of hosts.

## Isaiah 22:15
This is what the Lord, the God of hosts, says: “Go, approach this steward, to Shebna, who is in charge of the royal household:

## Isaiah 22:16
What right do you have here, and who do you have here, that you have carved a tomb for yourself here, you who carve a tomb on the height and chisel a resting place for yourself in the rock?

## Isaiah 22:17
Behold, the Lord is about to hurl you away violently, you strong man. He is about to seize you firmly

## Isaiah 22:18
and wrap you up tightly like a ball, to be thrown into a vast country; there you will die, and there your splendid chariots will be, a disgrace to your master’s house.

## Isaiah 22:19
I will remove you from your office, and you will be pulled down from your position.

## Isaiah 22:20
At that time, I will call for my servant, Eliakim son of Hilkiah.

## Isaiah 22:21
I will clothe him with your robe and fasten your sash securely around him, and I will hand your authority over to him. He will be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.

## Isaiah 22:22
I will set upon his shoulder the key to the house of David; what he opens, no one can shut, and what he shuts, no one can open.

## Isaiah 22:23
I will drive him like a peg into a firm place; he will become a throne of honour for his father’s house.

## Isaiah 22:24
All the glory of his family will hang on him: its offspring and descendants—all its lesser vessels, from the bowls to all the jars.

## Isaiah 22:25
On that day,” declares the Lord of hosts, “the peg driven into a firm place will give way; it will be sheared off and will fall, and the load hanging on it will be cut down, for the Lord has spoken.”
