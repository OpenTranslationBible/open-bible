# Isaiah Chapter 22

## Isaiah 22:1  
The pronouncement concerning the valley of vision:  
What is the matter with you now, that you have all gone up to the housetops?

## Isaiah 22:2  
You who were full of noise, you tumultuous city, you jubilant town;  
Your dead were not killed with the sword, nor did they die in battle.

## Isaiah 22:3  
All your rulers have fled together,  
And have been captured without the bow;  
All of you who were found have been taken prisoner together,  
Though they had fled far away.

## Isaiah 22:4  
Therefore I say, “Turn your eyes away from me,  
Let me weep bitterly,  
Do not comfort me concerning the destruction of the daughter of my people.”

## Isaiah 22:5  
For the Lord God of armies has a day of panic, subjugation, and confusion  
In the valley of vision,  
A breaking down of walls  
And a crying to the mountain.

## Isaiah 22:6  
Elam picked up the quiver,  
With the chariots, infantry, and horsemen;  
And Kir uncovered the shield.

## Isaiah 22:7  
Then your choicest valleys were full of chariots,  
And the horsemen took positions at the gate.

## Isaiah 22:8  
And He removed the defense of Judah.  
On that day you depended on the weapons of the house of the forest,

## Isaiah 22:9  
And you saw that the breaches  
In the wall of the city of David were many;  
And you collected the waters of the lower pool.

## Isaiah 22:10  
Then you counted the houses of Jerusalem  
And tore down houses to fortify the wall.

## Isaiah 22:11  
And you made a reservoir between the two walls  
For the waters of the old pool.  
But you did not depend on Him who made it,  
Nor did you take into consideration Him who planned it long ago.

## Isaiah 22:12  
Therefore on that day the Lord God of armies called you to weeping, to wailing,  
To shaving the head, and to wearing sackcloth.

## Isaiah 22:13  
Instead, there is joy and jubilation,  
Killing of cattle and slaughtering of sheep,  
Eating of meat and drinking of wine:  
“Let’s eat and drink, for tomorrow we may die.”

## Isaiah 22:14  
But the Lord of armies revealed Himself to me:  
“Certainly this wrongdoing will not be forgiven you  
Until you die,” says the Lord God of armies.

## Isaiah 22:15  
This is what the Lord God of armies says:  
“Go to this steward,  
To Shebna who is in charge of the royal household,

## Isaiah 22:16  
‘What right do you have here, and whom do you have here,  
That you have cut out a tomb for yourself here,  
You who cut out a tomb on the height,  
You who carve a resting place for yourself in the rock?

## Isaiah 22:17  
Behold, the Lord is about to hurl you violently, you strong man.  
And He is about to grasp you firmly

## Isaiah 22:18  
And roll you tightly like a ball,  
To be driven into a vast country;  
There you will die,  
And there your splendid chariots will be,  
You disgrace of your master’s house.’

## Isaiah 22:19  
And I will remove you from your office,  
And you will be pulled down from your position.

## Isaiah 22:20  
Then on that day I will summon My servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah,

## Isaiah 22:21  
And I will clothe him with your tunic,  
And tie your sash securely around him,  
I will entrust him with your authority;  
And he will become a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.

## Isaiah 22:22  
Then I will put the key of the house of David on his shoulder;  
When he opens, no one will shut,  
When he shuts, no one will open.

## Isaiah 22:23  
I will drive him like a peg in a firm place,  
And he will become a throne of glory to his father’s house.

## Isaiah 22:24  
So they will hang on him all the glory of his father’s house,  
The offspring and the descendants, all the least of vessels,  
From bowls to all the jars.

## Isaiah 22:25  
On that day,” declares the Lord of armies,  
“The peg driven in a firm place will give way; it will break off and fall,  
And the load hanging on it will be cut off, for the Lord has spoken.”
