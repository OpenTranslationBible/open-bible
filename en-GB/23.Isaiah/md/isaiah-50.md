# Isaiah Chapter 50

## Isaiah 50:1  
This is what the Lord says:  
“Where is the certificate of divorce  
By which I have sent your mother away?  
Or to whom of My creditors did I sell you?  
Behold, you were sold for your wrongdoings,  
And for your wrongful acts your mother was sent away.

## Isaiah 50:2  
Why was there no one when I came?  
When I called, why was there no one to answer?  
Is My hand so short that it cannot redeem?  
Or do I have no power to rescue?  
Behold, I dry up the sea with My rebuke,  
I turn rivers into a wilderness;  
Their fish stink for lack of water,  
And die of thirst.

## Isaiah 50:3  
I clothe the heavens with darkness,  
And make sackcloth their covering.”

## Isaiah 50:4  
The Lord God has given Me the tongue of disciples,  
So that I may know how to sustain the weary one with a word.  
He awakens Me morning by morning,  
He awakens My ear to listen as a disciple.

## Isaiah 50:5  
The Lord God has opened My ear,  
And I was not disobedient,  
Nor did I turn back.

## Isaiah 50:6  
I gave My back to those who strike Me,  
And My cheeks to those who pull out My beard;  
I did not hide My face from insults and spitting.

## Isaiah 50:7  
For the Lord God helps Me,  
Therefore I am not disgraced;  
Therefore, I have made My face like flint,  
And I know that I will not be ashamed.

## Isaiah 50:8  
He who vindicates Me is near;  
Who will contend with Me?  
Let us stand up to each other;  
Who has a case against Me?  
Let him approach Me.

## Isaiah 50:9  
Behold, the Lord God helps Me;  
Who is he who condemns Me?  
Behold, they will all wear out like a garment;  
A moth will eat them.

## Isaiah 50:10  
Who is among you who fears the Lord,  
Who obeys the voice of His Servant,  
Who walks in darkness and has no light?  
Let him trust in the name of the Lord and rely on his God.

## Isaiah 50:11  
Behold, all you who kindle a fire,  
Who encircle yourselves with flaming arrows,  
Walk in the light of your fire  
And among the arrows you have set ablaze.  
This you will have from My hand:  
You will lie down in torment.
