# Isaiah Chapter 31

## Isaiah 31:1
Woe to those who descend to Egypt for assistance, who depend on horses, and trust in the abundance of their chariots and the power of their horsemen, but do not turn to the Holy One of Israel or seek the Lord's guidance.

## Isaiah 31:2
Yet He is wise and brings calamity; He does not retract His words. He will rise against the nation of evildoers and those who support wrongdoers.

## Isaiah 31:3
The Egyptians are human and not divine; their horses are flesh, not spirit. When the Lord stretches out His hand, the helpers will stumble, and those aided will fall; all will perish together.

## Isaiah 31:4
This is what the Lord has spoken to me: “As a lion or young lion growls over its prey, and though a band of shepherds is summoned against it, it is not alarmed by their cries or disturbed by their noise, so the Lord Almighty will descend to wage war on Mount Zion and its hill.”

## Isaiah 31:5
Like birds hovering, the Lord Almighty will protect Jerusalem; He will shield and deliver it, He will pass over and rescue it.

## Isaiah 31:6
Return to Him, you Israelites, whom you have so greatly defied.

## Isaiah 31:7
For on that day, each of you will cast away your silver idols and gold idols, which your sinful hands have crafted.

## Isaiah 31:8
Assyria will fall by a sword not wielded by a human; a sword not of mortals will consume them. They will flee from the sword, and their young men will become forced labourers.

## Isaiah 31:9
Their stronghold will collapse out of panic, and their commanders will be terrified at the sight of the battle standard,” declares the Lord, whose fire is in Zion and whose furnace is in Jerusalem.
