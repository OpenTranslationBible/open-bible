# Isaiah Chapter 16

## Isaiah 16:1
Dispatch lambs as tribute to the sovereign of the land, from Sela, through the wilderness, to the mount of the daughter of Zion.

## Isaiah 16:2
Like fluttering birds cast from the nest, so are the daughters of Moab at the fords of the Arnon.

## Isaiah 16:3
“Give counsel, make a decision. Cast your shadow like night at midday. Conceal the fugitives, do not betray the refugees.

## Isaiah 16:4
Let the Moabite outcasts reside with you; provide them shelter from the destroyer.” The oppressor will cease, and devastation will end; the aggressors will be removed from the land.

## Isaiah 16:5
In faithfulness, a throne will be established; one will sit on it in the tent of David, seeking justice and being swift in righteousness.

## Isaiah 16:6
We have heard of Moab’s pride—how excessive is her arrogance!—of her conceit, her pride, and her fury; yet her boasts are empty.

## Isaiah 16:7
Therefore Moab will lament; all of Moab will wail. Mourn for the raisin cakes of Kir Hareseth as those deeply stricken.

## Isaiah 16:8
The fields of Heshbon wither, the vines of Sibmah too. The lords of the nations have trampled down the choice vines, which reached Jazer and spread towards the wilderness. Their tendrils extended and reached the sea.

## Isaiah 16:9
Therefore I will weep as Jazer weeps for the vines of Sibmah. I will drench you with my tears, Heshbon and Elealeh; for the shouts over your summer fruits and your harvest have ceased.

## Isaiah 16:10
Joy and gladness are removed from the orchards; in the vineyards, there is no singing or jubilant shouting; no one treads out wine at the presses, for I have silenced the shouting.

## Isaiah 16:11
My heart laments for Moab like the sound of a harp, my inmost being for Kir Hareseth.

## Isaiah 16:12
When Moab appears at her high place, she wears herself out; when she goes to her sanctuary to pray, it is to no avail.

## Isaiah 16:13
This is the word the Lord spoke earlier concerning Moab.

## Isaiah 16:14
But now the Lord declares: “Within three years, as a hired worker would count them, Moab’s splendour and her numerous people will be despised, and her survivors will be few and feeble.”
