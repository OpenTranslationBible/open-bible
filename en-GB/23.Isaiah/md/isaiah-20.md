# Isaiah Chapter 20

## Isaiah 20:1  
In the year that the commander came to Ashdod, when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him and he fought against Ashdod and captured it,

## Isaiah 20:2  
at that time the Lord spoke through Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, “Go and remove the sackcloth from your hips, and take your sandals off your feet.” And he did so, going naked and barefoot.

## Isaiah 20:3  
Then the Lord said, “Just as My servant Isaiah has gone naked and barefoot for three years as a sign and warning against Egypt and Cush,

## Isaiah 20:4  
so the king of Assyria will lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Cush, young and old, naked and barefoot with uncovered buttocks, to the shame of Egypt.

## Isaiah 20:5  
Then they will be ashamed of Cush their hope and Egypt their pride.

## Isaiah 20:6  
So the inhabitants of this coastland will say on that day, ‘Behold, such is our hope, where we fled for help to be saved from the king of Assyria; and how are we ourselves to escape?’”
