# Isaiah Chapter 20

## Isaiah 20:1
In the year that the commander was sent by Sargon, king of Assyria, to Ashdod, he fought against it and captured it—

## Isaiah 20:2
at that time the Lord spoke through Isaiah, son of Amoz, saying, “Remove the sackcloth from your body and take the sandals off your feet.” And he did so, walking around naked and barefoot.

## Isaiah 20:3
Then the Lord said, “Just as my servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot for three years as a sign and symbol against Egypt and Cush,

## Isaiah 20:4
so the king of Assyria will lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Cush, young and old, naked and barefoot, with buttocks exposed, to Egypt’s humiliation.

## Isaiah 20:5
Those who placed their trust in Cush and boasted in Egypt will be dismayed and ashamed.

## Isaiah 20:6
On that day, the inhabitants of this coastland will say, ‘Look at what has happened to those we relied on, those we fled to for help and deliverance from the king of Assyria! How then shall we escape?’”
