so is my word that goes out from my mouth: it will not return to me empty, but will accomplish what I desire and succeed in the purpose for which I sent it.

Instead of the thornbush will grow the juniper, and instead of briers the myrtle will grow. This will be a memorial to the Lord, an everlasting sign that will not be cut off.”
