# Isaiah Chapter 44

## Isaiah 44:1

“But now hear, Jacob, my servant, and Israel, whom I have chosen:

## Isaiah 44:2

This is what the Lord says— he who made you and formed you in the womb, who will help you: Do not fear, Jacob my servant, and Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.

## Isaiah 44:3

For I will pour water on the thirsty land, and streams on the dry ground; I will pour out my Spirit on your offspring, and my blessing on your descendants.

## Isaiah 44:4

They will spring up among the grass, like poplars by flowing streams.

## Isaiah 44:5

One will say, ‘I am the Lord’s’; another will call himself by the name of Jacob; and another will write on his hand, ‘The Lord’s,’ and will adopt the name Israel with honour.

## Isaiah 44:6

This is what the Lord says— the King of Israel and his Redeemer, the Lord of Hosts: I am the first and I am the last; apart from me, there is no God.

## Isaiah 44:7

Who is like me? Let him proclaim it. Let him declare and set it forth before me, what has happened since I established my ancient people, and what is yet to come— let them foretell what is to come.

## Isaiah 44:8

Do not tremble, do not be afraid. Have I not long since announced it and declared it? You are my witnesses. Is there any God besides me? No, there is no other Rock; I know not one.

## Isaiah 44:9

All who make idols are futile, and the things they treasure are of no benefit; even their witnesses fail to see or know, so that they will be put to shame.

## Isaiah 44:10

Who fashions a god or casts an idol, which is of no benefit?

## Isaiah 44:11

Behold, all their companions will be put to shame, for the craftsmen themselves are mere mortals. Let them all assemble and take their stand; they will be brought down to terror and shame.

## Isaiah 44:12

The blacksmith takes a tool and works with it in the coals; he shapes an idol with hammers and forges it with the might of his arm. He gets hungry and loses strength; he drinks no water and grows faint.

## Isaiah 44:13

The carpenter stretches a line and makes an outline with a marker; he roughs it out with chisels and marks it with compasses. He shapes it in human form, human form in all its beauty, to dwell in a shrine.

## Isaiah 44:14

He cuts down cedars, or perhaps takes a cypress or oak. He lets it grow strong among the trees of the forest, or plants a pine, and the rain makes it grow.

## Isaiah 44:15

It becomes fuel for burning; some of it he takes and warms himself, he kindles a fire and bakes bread. But he also fashions a god and worships it; he makes an idol and bows down to it.

## Isaiah 44:16

Half of the wood he burns in the fire; over it he prepares his meal, he roasts meat and eats his fill. He also warms himself and says, “Ah! I am warm; I see the fire.”

## Isaiah 44:17

From the rest he makes a god, his idol; he bows down to it and worships. He prays to it and says, “Save me! You are my god!”

## Isaiah 44:18

They know nothing, they understand nothing; their eyes are smeared over so they cannot see, and their hearts so they cannot comprehend.

## Isaiah 44:19

No one considers, nor is there knowledge or understanding to say, “Half of it I used for fuel; I even baked bread over its coals, I roasted meat and I ate. Shall I make a detestable thing from what is left? Shall I bow down to a block of wood?”

## Isaiah 44:20

He feeds on ashes; a deceived heart has misled him. He cannot save himself, nor say, “Is not this thing in my right hand a lie?”

## Isaiah 44:21

“Remember these things, Jacob, for you, Israel, are my servant. I have formed you, you are my servant; Israel, I will not forget you.

## Isaiah 44:22

I have swept away your transgressions like a cloud, and your sins like a mist. Return to me, for I have redeemed you.”

## Isaiah 44:23

Sing for joy, you heavens, for the Lord has done it; shout aloud, you lower parts of the earth. Burst into song, you mountains, you forests and all your trees, for the Lord has redeemed Jacob, and he displays his glory in Israel.

## Isaiah 44:24

This is what the Lord says— your Redeemer, who formed you from the womb: I am the Lord, the Maker of all things, who stretches out the heavens by myself, who spreads out the earth alone,

## Isaiah 44:25

who foils the signs of false prophets and makes fools of diviners, who overthrows the learning of the wise and turns it into nonsense,

## Isaiah 44:26

who confirms the word of his servant and carries out the purpose of his messengers, who says of Jerusalem, ‘It shall be inhabited,’ and of the towns of Judah, ‘They shall be rebuilt,’ and of their ruins, ‘I will restore them,’

## Isaiah 44:27

who says to the watery deep, ‘Be dry, and I will dry up your streams,’

## Isaiah 44:28

who says of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd and will accomplish all that I please; he will say of Jerusalem, “Let it be rebuilt,” and of the temple, “Let its foundations be laid.”’
