# Isaiah Chapter 66

## Isaiah 66:1
This is what the Lord says: “Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. Where is the house you could build for me? And where is my resting place?

## Isaiah 66:2
For my hand has made all these things, and so they came into being,” declares the Lord. “But I will look on this one: one who is humble and contrite in spirit, and who trembles at my word.

## Isaiah 66:3
But whoever slaughters an ox is like one who kills a person; whoever offers a lamb is like one who breaks a dog’s neck; whoever makes a grain offering is like one who offers pig’s blood; whoever burns incense is like one who worships an idol. They have chosen their own ways, and their souls delight in their abominations;

## Isaiah 66:4
so I will choose harsh treatment for them and bring upon them what they dread. For when I called, no one answered; when I spoke, they did not listen. Instead, they did evil in my sight and chose what displeases me.”

## Isaiah 66:5
Hear the word of the Lord, you who tremble at his word: “Your own people who hate you and exclude you because of my name have said, ‘Let the Lord be glorified, that we may see your joy!’ But they will be put to shame.

## Isaiah 66:6
A sound of uproar from the city, a voice from the temple, the voice of the Lord repaying his enemies what they deserve.

## Isaiah 66:7
“Before she goes into labour, she gives birth; before the pain comes upon her, she delivers a boy.

## Isaiah 66:8
Who has ever heard of such things? Who has ever seen things like this? Can a land be born in a day or a nation be brought forth in a moment? Yet as soon as Zion was in labour, she gave birth to her children.

## Isaiah 66:9
Do I bring to the moment of birth and not give delivery?” says the Lord. “Or do I close up the womb when I bring to delivery?” says your God.

## Isaiah 66:10
“Celebrate with Jerusalem and be glad for her, all you who love her; be filled with joy with her, all you who mourn over her,

## Isaiah 66:11
so that you may nurse and be satisfied at her comforting breasts; you will drink deeply and delight in her abundant breasts.”

## Isaiah 66:12
For this is what the Lord says: “I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream; you will be nursed, carried on her hip and dandled on her knees.

## Isaiah 66:13
As a mother comforts her child, so I will comfort you; and you will be comforted in Jerusalem.”

## Isaiah 66:14
When you see this, your heart will rejoice, and your bones will flourish like the new grass; the hand of the Lord will be made known to his servants, but he will be indignant towards his enemies.

## Isaiah 66:15
For behold, the Lord will come with fire, and his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.

## Isaiah 66:16
For with fire and with his sword the Lord will bring judgment upon all people, and many will fall by the hand of the Lord.

## Isaiah 66:17
“Those who sanctify and purify themselves to go into the gardens, following one in the centre, who eat pig’s flesh, detestable things, and mice, will meet their end together,” declares the Lord.

## Isaiah 66:18
“For I know their works and their thoughts, and the time is coming to gather all nations and languages. And they will come and see my glory.

## Isaiah 66:19
I will set a sign among them, and I will send survivors to the nations: to Tarshish, Put, Lud, Meshech, Tubal, and Javan, to the distant coastlands that have not heard of my fame or seen my glory. They will proclaim my glory among the nations.

## Isaiah 66:20
And they will bring all your people from all the nations to my holy mountain in Jerusalem as an offering to the Lord—on horses, in chariots and wagons, on mules and camels,” says the Lord, “as the Israelites bring their grain offerings in clean vessels to the house of the Lord.

## Isaiah 66:21
And I will select some of them as priests and Levites,” says the Lord.

## Isaiah 66:22
“For as the new heavens and the new earth that I make will endure before me,” declares the Lord, “so will your name and descendants endure.

## Isaiah 66:23
From one new moon to another and from one Sabbath to another, all mankind will come to bow down before me,” says the Lord.

## Isaiah 66:24
“Then they will go out and look on the corpses of those who have rebelled against me; for their worm will not die, and their fire will not be quenched, and they will be an abhorrence to all mankind.”
