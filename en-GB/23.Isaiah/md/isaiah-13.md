Raise a flag on a bare hill,  
Raise your voice to them,  
Wave the hand that they may enter the doors of the nobles.

I have commanded My consecrated ones,  
I have also called My warriors for My anger,  
Those who rejoice in My majesty.

## Isaiah 13:4  
A sound of uproar on the mountains,  
Like that of many people!  
A sound of the roar of kingdoms,  
Of nations gathered together!  
The Lord of armies is mustering the army for battle.

## Isaiah 13:5  
They are coming from a far country,  
From the farthest horizons,  
The Lord and His instruments of indignation,  
To destroy the whole land.

Wail, for the day of the Lord is near!  
It will come as destruction from the Almighty.

And every human heart will melt.

## Isaiah 13:8

Pains and agony will take hold of them;  
They will writhe like a woman in labour,  
They will look at one another in astonishment,  
Their faces aflame.

## Isaiah 13:9  
Behold, the day of the Lord is coming,  
Cruel, with fury and burning anger,  
To make the land a desolation;  
And He will exterminate its sinners from it.

For the stars of heaven and their constellations  
Will not flash their light;  
The sun will be dark when it rises,  
And the moon will not shed its light.

## Isaiah 13:11  
So I will punish the world for its evil  
And the wicked for their wrongdoing;  
I will also put an end to the arrogance of the proud  
And bring down the haughtiness of the ruthless.

## Isaiah 13:12  
I will make mortal man scarcer than pure gold  
And mankind than the gold of Ophir.

And the earth will be shaken from its place  
At the fury of the Lord of armies  
In the day of His burning anger.

## Isaiah 13:14  
And it will be that, like a hunted gazelle,  
Or like sheep with no one to gather them,  
Each will turn to his own people,  
And each will flee to his own land.

Anyone who is found will be thrust through,  
And anyone who is captured will fall by the sword.

## Isaiah 13:16  
Their little ones also will be dashed to pieces before their eyes;  
Their houses will be plundered  
And their wives raped.

Behold, I am going to stir up the Medes against them,  
Who will not value silver or take pleasure in gold.

## Isaiah 13:18  
And their bows will mow down the young men,  
They will not even have compassion on the fruit of the womb,  
Nor will their eye pity children.

## Isaiah 13:19  
And Babylon, the beauty of kingdoms,  
The glory of the Chaldeansâ€™ pride,  
Will be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.

## Isaiah 13:20  
It will never be inhabited or lived in from generation to generation;  
Nor will the Arab pitch his tent there,  
Nor will shepherds let their flocks lie down there.

## Isaiah 13:21  
But desert creatures will lie down there,  
And their houses will be full of owls;  
Ostriches also will live there,  
And shaggy goats will frolic there.

## Isaiah 13:22  
Hyenas will howl in their fortified towers  
And jackals in their luxurious palaces.  
Her fateful time also will come soon,  
And her days will not be prolonged.
