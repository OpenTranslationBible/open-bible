# Isaiah Chapter 13

## Isaiah 13:1
The oracle concerning Babylon that Isaiah the son of Amoz envisioned:

## Isaiah 13:2
Raise a banner on the bare hilltop, lift up your voice to them; wave the hand so that they may enter the gates of the nobles.

## Isaiah 13:3
I have commanded those I set apart for battle; I have summoned my warriors, who boast in my glory, to execute my wrath.

## Isaiah 13:4
Listen, a roar on the mountains, like that of a vast multitude! Hear the uproar of kingdoms, nations gathering together! The Lord of hosts is mustering an army for battle.

## Isaiah 13:5
They come from distant lands, from the farthest horizons— the Lord and the weapons of his indignation— to devastate the whole land.

## Isaiah 13:6
Cry out, for the day of the Lord is near; it will arrive as devastation from the Almighty.

## Isaiah 13:7
Therefore, all hands will hang limp, every heart will melt.

## Isaiah 13:8
They will be seized with terror, pain and anguish will grip them; they will writhe like a woman in labour. They will look at each other in astonishment, their faces aflame.

## Isaiah 13:9
Behold, the day of the Lord is coming— a day of cruelty, with fury and fierce anger— to make the land desolate and to annihilate the sinners within it.

## Isaiah 13:10
For the stars of heaven and their constellations will not shine; the rising sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light.

## Isaiah 13:11
I will punish the world for its evil, and the wicked for their iniquity. I will put an end to the arrogance of the proud and will humble the haughtiness of the ruthless.

## Isaiah 13:12
I will make people rarer than pure gold, more scarce than the gold of Ophir.

## Isaiah 13:13
Thus, I will cause the heavens to tremble, and the earth will be moved from its place at the wrath of the Lord of hosts, in the day of his burning anger.

## Isaiah 13:14
It will be like a hunted gazelle, or like sheep with no one to gather them; each will turn to his own people, each will flee to his native land.

## Isaiah 13:15
Whoever is found will be pierced through; all who are captured will fall by the sword.

## Isaiah 13:16
Their infants will be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses will be plundered and their wives violated.

## Isaiah 13:17
Behold, I am stirring up the Medes against them, who do not value silver and take no delight in gold.

## Isaiah 13:18
Their bows will strike down the young men; they will show no mercy to infants, nor will they pity children.

## Isaiah 13:19
And Babylon, the jewel of kingdoms, the pride and glory of the Chaldeans, will be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.

## Isaiah 13:20
It will never be inhabited or lived in through all generations; no Arab will pitch his tent there, no shepherds will let their flocks rest there.

## Isaiah 13:21
But desert creatures will lie there, and their houses will be full of owls; ostriches will dwell there, and wild goats will frolic there.

## Isaiah 13:22
Hyenas will howl in her strongholds, and jackals in her luxurious palaces. Her time is near to come, and her days will not be prolonged.
