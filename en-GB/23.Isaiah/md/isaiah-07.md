# Isaiah Chapter 7

## Isaiah 7:1

In the days of Ahaz son of Jotham, son of Uzziah, king of Judah, Rezin king of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to wage war against it, but they could not prevail against it.

## Isaiah 7:2

When the house of David was informed, “Aram has allied with Ephraim,” the hearts of Ahaz and his people trembled like trees of the forest shaken by the wind.

## Isaiah 7:3

Then the Lord said to Isaiah, “Go out now to meet Ahaz, you and your son Shear-Jashub, at the end of the aqueduct of the Upper Pool, on the road to the Launderer’s Field.

## Isaiah 7:4

Say to him, ‘Be careful, stay calm, do not fear, and do not lose heart because of these two smouldering stumps of firewood—because of the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram and the son of Remaliah.

## Isaiah 7:5

Aram, Ephraim, and Remaliah’s son have devised evil against you, saying,

## Isaiah 7:6

“Let us invade Judah, terrorise it, and divide it among ourselves, and set up the son of Tabeel as king in its midst.”

## Isaiah 7:7

Thus says the Sovereign Lord: “‘It shall not stand, nor shall it come to pass.

## Isaiah 7:8

For Damascus is the capital of Aram, and Rezin is the leader of Damascus. Within sixty-five years, Ephraim will be shattered, no longer a people.

## Isaiah 7:9

The head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah’s son. If you do not stand firm in faith, you will not stand at all.’”

## Isaiah 7:10

The Lord spoke again to Ahaz,

## Isaiah 7:11

“Seek a sign from the Lord your God, whether from the depths below or the heights above.”

## Isaiah 7:12

But Ahaz replied, “I will not seek a sign. I will not test the Lord.”

## Isaiah 7:13

Then Isaiah said, “Hear now, O house of David! Is it not enough to try the patience of men? Will you try the patience of my God also?

## Isaiah 7:14

Therefore the Lord himself will provide you with a sign: Behold, the young virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.

## Isaiah 7:15

He will eat curds and honey by the time he knows to refuse evil and choose good,

## Isaiah 7:16

for before the boy knows to refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings you dread will be deserted.

## Isaiah 7:17

The Lord will bring upon you, your people, and your father’s house days unlike any since Ephraim separated from Judah—he will bring the king of Assyria.”

## Isaiah 7:18

On that day, the Lord will whistle for the fly from the farthest streams of Egypt and for the bee from the land of Assyria.

## Isaiah 7:19

They will all come and settle in the steep ravines, in the clefts of the rocks, on all the thorn bushes, and at all the watering places.

## Isaiah 7:20

On that day, the Lord will use a razor hired from beyond the Euphrates—the king of Assyria—to shave your head and the hair of your legs, and to remove your beard also.

## Isaiah 7:21

On that day, a person will sustain a young cow and two sheep.

## Isaiah 7:22

And because of the abundance of milk they produce, he will eat curds; for everyone left in the land will eat curds and honey.

## Isaiah 7:23

On that day, every place where there were a thousand vines worth a thousand silver shekels will become briers and thorns.

## Isaiah 7:24

People will go there with bows and arrows, because the whole land will be covered with briers and thorns.

## Isaiah 7:25

As for all the hills once cultivated with the hoe, you will not go there for fear of briers and thorns; they will become places for cattle to roam and sheep to trample.
