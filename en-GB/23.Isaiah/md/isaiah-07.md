# Isaiah Chapter 7

## Isaiah 7:1  
Now it came about in the days of Ahaz, the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Aram and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to wage war against it, but could not overpower it.

## Isaiah 7:2  
When it was reported to the house of David, saying, “The Arameans have camped in Ephraim,” his heart and the hearts of his people shook as the trees of the forest shake with the wind.

## Isaiah 7:3  
Then the Lord said to Isaiah, “Go out now to meet Ahaz, you and your son Shear-jashub, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, on the road to the fuller’s field,

## Isaiah 7:4  
And say to him, ‘Take care and be calm, have no fear and do not be fainthearted because of these two stubs of smoldering logs, on account of the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram and the son of Remaliah.

## Isaiah 7:5  
Because Aram has planned evil against you, with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, saying,

## Isaiah 7:6  
“Let’s go up against Judah and terrorize it, and make for ourselves a breach in its walls, and appoint the son of Tabeel as king in the midst of it,”

## Isaiah 7:7  
This is what the Lord God says:  
“It shall not stand nor shall it come to pass.

## Isaiah 7:8  
For the head of Aram is Damascus,  
And the head of Damascus is Rezin  
(Within sixty-five years Ephraim will be broken to pieces, so that it will no longer be a people),

## Isaiah 7:9  
And the head of Ephraim is Samaria,  
And the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah.  
If you will not believe, you certainly shall not last.”’”

## Isaiah 7:10  
Then the Lord spoke again to Ahaz, saying,

## Isaiah 7:11  
“Ask for a sign for yourself from the Lord your God; make it deep as Sheol or high as heaven.”

## Isaiah 7:12  
But Ahaz said, “I will not ask, nor will I put the Lord to the test!”

## Isaiah 7:13  
Then he said, “Listen now, house of David! Is it too trivial a thing for you to try the patience of men, that you will try the patience of my God as well?

## Isaiah 7:14  
Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and she will name Him Immanuel.

## Isaiah 7:15  
He will eat curds and honey at the time He knows enough to refuse evil and choose good.

## Isaiah 7:16  
For before the boy knows enough to refuse evil and choose good, the land whose two kings you dread will be abandoned.

## Isaiah 7:17  
The Lord will bring on you, on your people, and on your father’s house days that have never come since the day that Ephraim separated from Judah—the king of Assyria!”

## Isaiah 7:18  
On that day the Lord will whistle for the fly that is in the remotest part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.

## Isaiah 7:19  
They will all come and settle on the steep ravines, on the ledges of the cliffs, on all the thorn bushes, and on all the watering places.

## Isaiah 7:20  
On that day the Lord will shave with a razor, hired from regions beyond the Euphrates River (that is, with the king of Assyria), the head and the hair of the legs, and it will also remove the beard.

## Isaiah 7:21  
Now on that day a person may keep alive a heifer and a pair of sheep;

## Isaiah 7:22  
And because of the abundance of the milk produced he will eat curds, for everyone left within the land will eat curds and honey.

## Isaiah 7:23  
And it will come about on that day, that every place where there used to be a thousand vines, worth a thousand shekels of silver, will become thorns and briars.

## Isaiah 7:24  
People will come there with bows and arrows, because all the land will be thorns and briars.

## Isaiah 7:25  
As for all the hills which used to be cultivated with the hoe, you will not go there for fear of thorns and briars; but they will become a place for pasturing oxen and for sheep to trample.
