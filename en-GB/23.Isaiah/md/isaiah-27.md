# Isaiah Chapter 27

## Isaiah 27:1
On that day, the Lord will punish Leviathan, the swift serpent, with His fierce, great, and mighty sword— Leviathan, the coiling serpent; He will slay the dragon of the sea.

## Isaiah 27:2
On that day— “Sing of a delightful vineyard:

## Isaiah 27:3
I, the Lord, am its keeper; I water it continually. I guard it day and night so that no one can harm it.

## Isaiah 27:4
I am not angry. If only there were briars and thorns to confront me! I would march against them; I would set them all ablaze.

## Isaiah 27:5
Or let them seek My protection; let them make peace with Me, yes, let them make peace with Me.”

## Isaiah 27:6
In the days to come, Jacob will take root, Israel will blossom and sprout, and they will fill the entire world with fruit.

## Isaiah 27:7
Has He struck them as He struck those who struck them? Or have they been slain as those were slain who killed them?

## Isaiah 27:8
By warfare and exile, you contended with them— with His fierce wind He drove them away, as on the day the east wind blows.

## Isaiah 27:9
Therefore, through this, Jacob’s guilt will be atoned for, and this will be the full measure of the removal of his sin: When he makes all the altar stones like crushed chalk, no Asherah poles or incense altars will remain standing.

## Isaiah 27:10
The fortified city stands isolated, a deserted homestead, abandoned like the wilderness; there the calves graze, there they lie down and strip its branches bare.

## Isaiah 27:11
When its branches are dry, they are broken off, and women come to make fires with them. For this is a people without understanding; therefore, their Maker will show them no compassion, and their Creator will not be gracious to them.

## Isaiah 27:12
On that day, the Lord will thresh from the flowing Euphrates to the brook of Egypt, and you, the children of Israel, will be gathered one by one.

## Isaiah 27:13
And on that day, a great trumpet will sound. Those who were perishing in Assyria and those who were exiled in Egypt will come and worship the Lord on the holy mountain in Jerusalem.
