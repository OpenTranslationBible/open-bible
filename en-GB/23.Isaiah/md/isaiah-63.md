# Isaiah Chapter 63

## Isaiah 63:1

Who is this coming from Edom, with garments of radiant colours from Bozrah, this one who is majestic in his attire, marching forward in the greatness of his strength? “It is I, the one who speaks in righteousness, mighty to save.”

## Isaiah 63:2

Why are your garments red, like those of one who treads the winepress?

## Isaiah 63:3

“I have trodden the winepress alone, and from the nations no one was with me. I trampled them in my anger and crushed them in my wrath; their lifeblood spattered my garments, and I stained all my clothing.

## Isaiah 63:4

For the day of vengeance was in my heart, and the year of my redemption has come.

## Isaiah 63:5

I looked, but there was no one to help, and I was appalled that no one gave support; so my own arm brought salvation to me, and my wrath upheld me.

## Isaiah 63:6

I trampled down the nations in my anger and made them drunk with my wrath, and I poured out their lifeblood on the ground.”

## Isaiah 63:7

I will recount the mercies of the Lord, and the praises of the Lord, according to all that the Lord has done for us, and the great goodness towards the house of Israel, which he has granted according to his compassion and the abundance of his mercies.

## Isaiah 63:8

For he said, “Surely they are my people, children who will not be false.” So he became their Saviour.

## Isaiah 63:9

In all their suffering, he also suffered, and the angel of his presence delivered them. In his love and mercy, he redeemed them; he lifted them up and carried them throughout the days of old.

## Isaiah 63:10

Yet they rebelled and saddened his Holy Spirit; so he turned and became their adversary, and he himself contended against them.

## Isaiah 63:11

Then his people remembered the days of old, the days of Moses. Where is he who brought them through the sea with the shepherd of his flock? Where is he who set his Holy Spirit among them,

## Isaiah 63:12

who sent his glorious arm of power to be at Moses’ right hand, who divided the waters before them to gain for himself an everlasting name,

## Isaiah 63:13

who led them through the depths? Like a horse in the wilderness, they did not stumble;

## Isaiah 63:14

like cattle that go down to the plain, the Spirit of the Lord gave them rest. So you led your people to make for yourself a glorious name.

## Isaiah 63:15

Look down from heaven and see from your holy and glorious lofty habitation. Where are your zeal and your mighty deeds? The stirrings of your heart and your compassion are withheld from us.

## Isaiah 63:16

For you are our Father, though Abraham does not know us and Israel does not recognise us; you, Lord, are our Father, our Redeemer from of old is your name.

## Isaiah 63:17

Why, Lord, do you cause us to stray from your ways and harden our hearts from fearing you? Return for the sake of your servants, the tribes of your heritage.

## Isaiah 63:18

For a little while your holy people possessed your sanctuary, but now our adversaries have trampled it down.

## Isaiah 63:19

We have become a people whom you have not ruled, just like those who have not been called by your name.
