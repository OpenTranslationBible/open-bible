# Isaiah Chapter 65

## Isaiah 65:1
“I allowed myself to be discovered by those who did not ask for me; I was found by those who did not seek me. I said, ‘Here I am, here I am,’ to a nation that did not call on my name.

## Isaiah 65:2
I have stretched out my hands all day to a rebellious people, who walk in ways that are not good, following their own thoughts—

## Isaiah 65:3
a people who constantly provoke me openly, offering sacrifices in gardens and burning incense on bricks;

## Isaiah 65:4
who sit among the graves and spend the night in secret places; who eat the flesh of pigs, and whose pots contain the broth of unclean meat;

## Isaiah 65:5
who say, ‘Keep to yourself, do not come near me, for I am holier than you!’ Such people are smoke in my nostrils, a fire that burns all day long.

## Isaiah 65:6
Behold, it is recorded before me: I will not remain silent but will repay; I will repay into their laps—

## Isaiah 65:7
both your sins and the sins of your ancestors,” says the Lord. “Because they offered incense on the mountains and scorned me on the hills, I will measure into their laps the full payment for their former actions.”

## Isaiah 65:8
This is what the Lord says: “As when new wine is found in a cluster, and someone says, ‘Do not destroy it, for there is a blessing in it,’ so will I act on behalf of my servants, not to destroy them all.

## Isaiah 65:9
I will bring forth descendants from Jacob, and from Judah those who will inherit my mountains; my chosen ones will possess them, and there my servants will dwell.

## Isaiah 65:10
Sharon will be a pasture for flocks, and the Valley of Achor a resting place for herds, for my people who seek me.

## Isaiah 65:11
But as for you who abandon the Lord and forget my holy mountain, who set a table for Fortune and fill bowls of mixed wine for Destiny,

## Isaiah 65:12
I will destine you for the sword, and all of you will bow down to the slaughter; because I called and you did not answer, I spoke and you did not listen. You did evil in my sight and chose what displeases me.”

## Isaiah 65:13
Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: “Behold, my servants will eat, but you will be hungry; behold, my servants will drink, but you will be thirsty; behold, my servants will rejoice, but you will be put to shame.

## Isaiah 65:14
Behold, my servants will sing out of the joy of their hearts, but you will cry out from pain of heart and wail from a broken spirit.

## Isaiah 65:15
You will leave your name as a curse for my chosen ones, and the Sovereign Lord will put you to death, but he will give his servants another name.

## Isaiah 65:16
Whoever invokes a blessing in the land will do so by the God of truth; whoever swears an oath in the land will swear by the God of truth. For the former troubles will be forgotten and hidden from my sight.

## Isaiah 65:17
“For indeed, I create new heavens and a new earth, and the former things will not be remembered or come to mind.

## Isaiah 65:18
But be glad and rejoice forever in what I create; for indeed, I create Jerusalem for rejoicing and her people for gladness.

## Isaiah 65:19
I will rejoice over Jerusalem and take delight in my people; the sound of weeping and of crying will no longer be heard in her.

## Isaiah 65:20
No longer will there be in it an infant who lives only a few days, or an old person who does not live out his years; the one who dies at a hundred will be considered a mere youth, and the one who fails to reach a hundred will be thought accursed.

## Isaiah 65:21
They will build houses and live in them; they will also plant vineyards and enjoy their fruit.

## Isaiah 65:22
They will not build and others inhabit, they will not plant and others eat; for as the days of a tree, so will be the days of my people, and my chosen ones will long enjoy the work of their hands.

## Isaiah 65:23
They will not labour in vain, nor bear children doomed to misfortune; for they will be a people blessed by the Lord, they and their descendants with them.

## Isaiah 65:24
Even before they call, I will respond; while they are still speaking, I will attend to them.

## Isaiah 65:25
The wolf and the lamb will graze together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox, and dust will be the serpent’s food. They will do no harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain,” says the Lord.
