## Isaiah 62:1
For the sake of Zion, I will not remain silent, and for the sake of Jerusalem, I will not be quiet, until her righteousness shines like the dawn, and her salvation like a burning torch.

## Isaiah 62:3
You will be like a crown of splendour in the Lord’s hand, a royal diadem held by your God.

## Isaiah 62:4

and give Him no rest until He establishes Jerusalem and makes her the praise of the earth.
