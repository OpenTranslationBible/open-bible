# Isaiah Chapter 62

## Isaiah 62:1  
For the sake of Zion I will not keep silent,  
And for the sake of Jerusalem I will not keep quiet,  
Until her righteousness goes out like brightness,  
And her salvation like a torch that is burning.

## Isaiah 62:2  
The nations will see your righteousness,  
And all kings your glory;  
And you will be called by a new name  
Which the mouth of the Lord will designate.

## Isaiah 62:3  
You will also be a crown of beauty in the hand of the Lord,  
And a royal headband in the hand of your God.

## Isaiah 62:4  
It will no longer be said to you, “Forsaken,”  
Nor to your land will it any longer be said, “Desolate”;  
But you will be called, “My delight is in her,”  
And your land, “Married”;  
For the Lord delights in you,  
And to Him your land will be married.

## Isaiah 62:5  
For as a young man marries a virgin,  
So your sons will marry you;  
And as the groom rejoices over the bride,  
So your God will rejoice over you.

## Isaiah 62:6  
On your walls, Jerusalem, I have appointed watchmen;  
All day and all night they will never keep silent.  
You who profess the Lord, take no rest for yourselves;

## Isaiah 62:7  
And do not give Him rest until He establishes  
And makes Jerusalem an object of praise on the earth.

## Isaiah 62:8  
The Lord has sworn by His right hand and by His mighty arm:  
“I will never again give your grain as food for your enemies,  
Nor will foreigners drink your new wine for which you have labored.”

## Isaiah 62:9  
But those who harvest it will eat it and praise the Lord,  
And those who gather it will drink it in the courtyards of My sanctuary.

## Isaiah 62:10  
Go through, go through the gates,  
Clear a way for the people!  
Build up, build up the highway,  
Remove the stones, lift up a flag over the peoples.

## Isaiah 62:11  
Behold, the Lord has proclaimed to the end of the earth:  
Say to the daughter of Zion, “Behold, your salvation is coming;  
Behold, His reward is with Him, and His compensation before Him.”

## Isaiah 62:12  
And they will call them, “The holy people,  
The redeemed of the Lord”;  
And you will be called, “Sought Out, A City Not Abandoned.”
