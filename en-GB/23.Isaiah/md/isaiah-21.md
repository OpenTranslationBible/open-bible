## Isaiah 21:2
A severe vision has been revealed to me: The traitor continues to betray, and the destroyer continues to destroy. Elam, advance! Media, lay siege! I have put an end to all her groaning.

## Isaiah 21:3
Therefore my loins are filled with anguish; pains grip me like those of a woman in labour. I am bewildered by what I hear, I am terrified by what I see.

My heart staggers, horror overwhelms me; the twilight I longed for has been turned into a horror for me.

## Isaiah 21:5
They set the tables, they spread out the cloths, they eat, they drink! Rise up, commanders, oil the shields!

## Isaiah 21:6
For this is what the Lord has said to me: “Go, post a watchman, let him declare what he sees.

## Isaiah 21:7
When he sees chariots with teams of horses, riders on donkeys, riders on camels, he must be fully alert, very alert.”

## Isaiah 21:8
And the watchman called out, “Day after day, my lord, I stand on the watchtower; every night I remain at my post.

## Isaiah 21:9
And behold, here comes a chariot of men, with a pair of horsemen. And he answered, saying, ‘Babylon has fallen, has fallen! All the images of its gods lie shattered on the ground!’”

## Isaiah 21:13
A proclamation concerning Arabia: You caravans of Dedanites, who lodge in the thickets of Arabia,

## Isaiah 21:14
bring water for the thirsty; you inhabitants of Tema, meet the fugitives with bread.

## Isaiah 21:15
For they flee from the swords, from the drawn sword, from the bent bow, and from the heat of battle.

For this is what the Lord has spoken to me: “Within a year, as a hired worker would count it, all the splendour of Kedar will come to an end.

## Isaiah 21:17
The number of the archers, the warriors of Kedar, will be few.” The Lord, the God of Israel, has spoken.
