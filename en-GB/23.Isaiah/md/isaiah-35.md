# Isaiah Chapter 35

## Isaiah 35:1
The wilderness and the parched land shall be glad; the desert will rejoice and blossom abundantly, like the crocus.

## Isaiah 35:2
It will burst into bloom and rejoice with great joy and singing. The glory of Lebanon will be bestowed upon it, the splendour of Carmel and Sharon. They shall see the glory of the Lord, the majesty of our God.

## Isaiah 35:3
Support those with weak hands, and steady the trembling knees.

## Isaiah 35:4
Say to those with anxious hearts, “Be strong, do not fear; behold, your God will come with vengeance, with divine retribution. He will come to save you.”

## Isaiah 35:5
Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.

## Isaiah 35:6
Then the lame shall leap like a deer, and the tongue of the mute shall shout for joy. For waters shall gush forth in the wilderness, and streams in the desert.

## Isaiah 35:7
The burning sand shall become a pool, and the thirsty ground springs of water. In the haunt of jackals, where they once lay, grass, reeds, and rushes shall grow.

## Isaiah 35:8
And a highway shall be there, called the Way of Holiness. The unclean shall not travel on it, but it shall be for those who walk in that Way; fools shall not wander on it.

## Isaiah 35:9
No lion shall be there, nor shall any ravenous beast go up on it; they shall not be found there. But the redeemed shall walk there,

## Isaiah 35:10
and the ransomed of the Lord shall return and come to Zion with singing; everlasting joy shall crown their heads. Gladness and joy shall overtake them, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
