# Isaiah Chapter 49

## Isaiah 49:1  
Listen to Me, you islands,  
And pay attention, you peoples from afar.  
The Lord called Me from the womb;  
From the body of My mother He named Me.

## Isaiah 49:2  
He has made My mouth like a sharp sword,  
In the shadow of His hand He has concealed Me;  
And He has also made Me a sharpened arrow,  
He has hidden Me in His quiver.

## Isaiah 49:3  
He said to Me, “You are My Servant, Israel,  
In whom I will show My glory.”

## Isaiah 49:4  
But I said, “I have labored in vain,  
I have spent My strength for nothing and futility;  
Nevertheless, the justice due to Me is with the Lord,  
And My reward is with My God.”

## Isaiah 49:5  
And now says the Lord, who formed Me from the womb to be His Servant,  
To bring Jacob back to Him, so that Israel might be gathered to Him  
(For I am honored in the sight of the Lord,  
And My God is My strength),

## Isaiah 49:6  
He says, “It is too small a thing that You should be My Servant  
To raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the protected ones of Israel;  
I will also make You a light of the nations  
So that My salvation may reach to the end of the earth.”

## Isaiah 49:7  
This is what the Lord, the Redeemer of Israel and its Holy One,  
Says to the despised One,  
To the One hated by the nation,  
To the Servant of rulers:  
“Kings will see and arise,  
Princes will also bow down,  
Because of the Lord who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel who has chosen You.”

## Isaiah 49:8  
This is what the Lord says:  
“At a favorable time I answered You,  
And on a day of salvation I helped You;  
And I will watch over You and make You a covenant of the people,  
To restore the land,  
To give as inheritances the desolate hereditary lands;

## Isaiah 49:9  
Saying to those who are bound, ‘Go free,’  
To those who are in darkness, ‘Show yourselves.’  
They will feed along the roads,  
And their pastures will be on all bare heights.

## Isaiah 49:10  
They will not hunger or thirst,  
Nor will the scorching heat or sun strike them down;  
For He who has compassion on them will lead them,  
And will guide them to springs of water.

## Isaiah 49:11  
I will make all My mountains a road,  
And My highways will be raised up.

## Isaiah 49:12  
Behold, these will come from afar;  
And behold, these will come from the north and from the west,  
And these from the land of Aswan.”

## Isaiah 49:13  
Shout for joy, you heavens! And rejoice, you earth!  
Break forth into joyful shouting, mountains!  
For the Lord has comforted His people  
And will have compassion on His afflicted.

## Isaiah 49:14  
But Zion said, “The Lord has abandoned me,  
And the Lord has forgotten me.”

## Isaiah 49:15  
“Can a woman forget her nursing child  
And have no compassion on the son of her womb?  
Even if these forget, I will not forget you.

## Isaiah 49:16  
Behold, I have inscribed you on the palms of My hands;  
Your walls are continually before Me.

## Isaiah 49:17  
Your builders hurry;  
Your destroyers and devastators  
Will leave you.

## Isaiah 49:18  
Raise your eyes and look around;  
All of them gather together, they come to you.  
As I live,” declares the Lord,  
“You will assuredly put them all on as jewelry and bind them on as a bride.

## Isaiah 49:19  
For your ruins and deserted places and your destroyed land—  
Now you will certainly be too cramped for the inhabitants,  
And those who swallowed you will be far away.

## Isaiah 49:20  
The children you lost will yet say in your ears,  
‘The place is too cramped for me;  
Make room for me that I may live here.’

## Isaiah 49:21  
Then you will say in your heart,  
‘Who has fathered these for me,  
Since I have been bereaved of my children and cannot have children,  
And am an exile, and a wanderer?  
And who has raised these?  
Behold, I was left alone;  
Where are these from?’”

## Isaiah 49:22  
This is what the Lord God says:  
“Behold, I will lift up My hand to the nations  
And set up My flag to the peoples;  
And they will bring your sons in their arms,  
And your daughters will be carried on their shoulders.

## Isaiah 49:23  
Kings will be your guardians,  
And their princesses your nurses.  
They will bow down to you with their faces to the ground  
And lick the dust from your feet;  
And you will know that I am the Lord;  
Those who hopefully wait for Me will not be put to shame.

## Isaiah 49:24  
Can the prey be taken from a mighty man,  
Or the captives of a tyrant be rescued?”

## Isaiah 49:25  
Indeed, this is what the Lord says:  
“Even the captives of a mighty man may be taken away,  
And the prey of a tyrant may be rescued;  
For I will contend with the one who contends with you,  
And I will save your sons.

## Isaiah 49:26  
I will make your oppressors eat their own flesh,  
And they will become drunk with their own blood as with sweet wine;  
And all flesh will know that I, the Lord, am your Savior  
And your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.”
