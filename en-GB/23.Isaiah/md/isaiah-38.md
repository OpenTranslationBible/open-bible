# Isaiah Chapter 38

## Isaiah 38:1

In those days, Hezekiah became seriously ill and was near death. The prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz, came to him and said, “This is what the Lord says: Put your affairs in order, for you are going to die; you will not survive.”

## Isaiah 38:2

Hezekiah then turned and faced the wall and prayed to the Lord,

## Isaiah 38:3

saying, “Remember, Lord, how I have walked before you with wholehearted devotion and in truth, and have done what is good in your sight.” And Hezekiah wept bitterly.

## Isaiah 38:4

Then the word of the Lord came to Isaiah,

## Isaiah 38:5

“Go and tell Hezekiah, ‘This is what the Lord, the God of your ancestor David, says: I have heard your prayer and seen your tears; I will add fifteen years to your life.

## Isaiah 38:6

I will also deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city.

## Isaiah 38:7

“‘This will be the sign to you from the Lord that He will do what He has promised:

## Isaiah 38:8

I will make the shadow cast by the sun go back ten steps on the stairway of Ahaz.’” So the shadow went back the ten steps it had descended.

## Isaiah 38:9

This is the account of Hezekiah, king of Judah, after he was ill and recovered:

## Isaiah 38:10

I said, “In the middle of my days I must pass through the gates of Sheol and be deprived of the rest of my years.”

## Isaiah 38:11

I said, “I will not see the Lord in the land of the living; I will no longer look upon mankind or be among the inhabitants of the world.

## Isaiah 38:12

Like a shepherd’s tent, my dwelling is pulled up and taken from me. Like a weaver, I have rolled up my life, and he cuts me off from the loom; from day to night you bring me to an end.

## Isaiah 38:13

I composed myself until morning, but like a lion, he breaks all my bones; from day to night you bring me to an end.

## Isaiah 38:14

I chirped like a swallow or a crane, I moaned like a dove. My eyes grew weak as I looked to the heavens. I am oppressed, Lord, be my support!”

## Isaiah 38:15

But what shall I say? He has spoken to me, and He Himself has done it. I will walk humbly all my years because of this anguish of my soul.

## Isaiah 38:16

Lord, by such things people live; and in all these is the life of my spirit. Restore me to health and let me live.

## Isaiah 38:17

Surely it was for my benefit that I suffered such bitterness. In your love, you have kept me from the pit of destruction; you have cast all my sins behind your back.

## Isaiah 38:18

For Sheol cannot thank you, death cannot praise you; those who go down to the pit cannot hope for your faithfulness.

## Isaiah 38:19

The living, the living—they give thanks to you, as I do today; parents tell their children about your faithfulness.

## Isaiah 38:20

The Lord will save me, and we will sing with stringed instruments all the days of our lives in the house of the Lord.

## Isaiah 38:21

Isaiah had instructed, “Prepare a poultice of figs and apply it to the boil, and he will recover.”

## Isaiah 38:22

Hezekiah had asked, “What will be the sign that I will go up to the house of the Lord?”
