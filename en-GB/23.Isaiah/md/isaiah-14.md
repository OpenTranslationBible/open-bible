# Isaiah Chapter 14

## Isaiah 14:1  
When the Lord has compassion on Jacob and again chooses Israel,  
He will settle them on their own land.  
Then strangers will join them and attach themselves to the house of Jacob.

## Isaiah 14:2  
The peoples will take them along and bring them to their place,  
And the house of Israel will possess them as an inheritance in the land of the Lord  
As male and female servants;  
And they will take their captors captive  
And will rule over their oppressors.

## Isaiah 14:3  
And it will be on the day when the Lord gives you rest from your pain and turmoil  
And harsh service in which you have been enslaved,

## Isaiah 14:4  
That you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon, and say,  
“How the oppressor has ceased,  
And how the onslaught has ceased!

## Isaiah 14:5  
The Lord has broken the staff of the wicked,  
The scepter of rulers,

## Isaiah 14:6  
Which used to strike the peoples in fury with unceasing blows,  
Which subdued the nations in anger with unrestrained persecution.

## Isaiah 14:7  
The whole earth is at rest and is quiet;  
They break forth into shouts of joy.

## Isaiah 14:8  
Even the juniper trees rejoice over you, and the cedars of Lebanon, saying,  
‘Since you have been laid low, no tree cutter comes up against us.’

## Isaiah 14:9  
Sheol below is excited about you,  
To meet you when you come;  
It stirs the spirits of the dead for you,  
All the leaders of the earth;  
It raises all the kings of the nations from their thrones.

## Isaiah 14:10  
They will all respond and say to you,  
‘Even you have become weak as we,  
You have become like us.

## Isaiah 14:11  
Your pride and the music of your harps  
Have been brought down to Sheol;  
Maggots are spread out as your bed beneath you  
And worms are your covering.’

## Isaiah 14:12  
How you have fallen from heaven,  
You star of the morning, son of the dawn!  
You have been cut down to the earth,  
You who defeated the nations!

## Isaiah 14:13  
But you said in your heart,  
‘I will ascend to heaven;  
I will raise my throne above the stars of God,  
And I will sit on the mount of assembly  
In the remote parts of the north.

## Isaiah 14:14  
I will ascend above the heights of the clouds;  
I will make myself like the Most High.’

## Isaiah 14:15  
Nevertheless you will be brought down to Sheol,  
To the recesses of the pit.

## Isaiah 14:16  
Those who see you will stare at you,  
They will carefully consider you, saying,  
‘Is this the man who made the earth tremble,  
Who shook kingdoms,

## Isaiah 14:17  
Who made the world like a wilderness  
And overthrew its cities,  
Who did not allow his prisoners to go home?’

## Isaiah 14:18  
All the kings of the nations lie in glory,  
Each in his own tomb.

## Isaiah 14:19  
But you have been hurled out of your tomb  
Like a rejected branch,  
Clothed with those killed who are pierced with a sword,  
Who go down to the stones of the pit  
Like a trampled corpse.

## Isaiah 14:20  
You will not be united with them in burial,  
Because you have destroyed your country,  
You have killed your people.  
May the descendants of evildoers never be mentioned again.

## Isaiah 14:21  
Prepare a place of slaughter for his sons  
Because of the wrongdoing of their fathers.  
They must not rise and take possession of the earth  
And fill the surface of the world with cities.”

## Isaiah 14:22  
“I will rise up against them,” declares the Lord of armies,  
“And eliminate the name of Babylon and survivors, offspring and descendants,” declares the Lord.

## Isaiah 14:23  
“I will also make it a possession for the hedgehog and swamps of water,  
And I will sweep it with the broom of destruction,” declares the Lord of armies.

## Isaiah 14:24  
The Lord of armies has sworn, saying,  
“Certainly, just as I have intended, so it has happened,  
And just as I have planned, so it will stand,

## Isaiah 14:25  
To break Assyria in My land,  
And I will trample him on My mountains.  
Then his yoke will be removed from them,  
And his burden removed from their shoulder.

## Isaiah 14:26  
This is the plan devised against the entire earth;  
And this is the hand that is stretched out against all the nations.

## Isaiah 14:27  
For the Lord of armies has planned, and who can frustrate it?  
And as for His stretched-out hand, who can turn it back?”

## Isaiah 14:28  
In the year that King Ahaz died, this pronouncement came:

## Isaiah 14:29  
“Do not rejoice, Philistia, all of you,  
Because the rod that struck you is broken;  
For from the serpent’s root a viper will come out,  
And its fruit will be a winged serpent.

## Isaiah 14:30  
Those who are most helpless will eat,  
And the poor will lie down in security;  
But I will put your root to death with famine,  
And it will kill your survivors.

## Isaiah 14:31  
Wail, you gate; cry, you city;  
Melt away, Philistia, all of you!  
For smoke comes from the north,  
And there is no straggler in his ranks.

## Isaiah 14:32  
How then will one answer the messengers of the nation?  
That the Lord has founded Zion,  
And the poor of His people will take refuge in it.”
