# Isaiah Chapter 14

## Isaiah 14:1

The Lord will show mercy to Jacob and will once more choose Israel, settling them in their own land. Strangers will join them and attach themselves to the house of Jacob.

## Isaiah 14:2

Nations will escort them and bring them to their place, and the house of Israel will possess them in the land of the Lord as male and female servants. They will capture their captors and rule over their oppressors.

## Isaiah 14:3

On the day the Lord grants you rest from your suffering, turmoil, and the harsh labour in which you were enslaved,

## Isaiah 14:4

you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon: “How the oppressor has ceased, how his fury has ended!”

## Isaiah 14:5

The Lord has shattered the rod of the wicked, the sceptre of rulers,

## Isaiah 14:6

which struck peoples in anger with unceasing blows, and subdued nations in wrath with relentless persecution.

## Isaiah 14:7

The whole earth is at rest and quiet; they burst into song.

## Isaiah 14:8

Even the junipers and the cedars of Lebanon rejoice over you, saying, “Now that you have been laid low, no woodcutter comes against us.”

## Isaiah 14:9

The realm of the dead below is stirred to meet you at your coming; it awakens the spirits of the departed, all the leaders of the earth; it raises all the kings of the nations from their thrones.

## Isaiah 14:10

They will all answer and say to you, “You too have become weak as we are; you have become like us.”

## Isaiah 14:11

Your pomp and the sound of your harps have been brought down to the grave; maggots are spread beneath you, and worms cover you.

## Isaiah 14:12

How you have fallen from heaven, morning star, son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations!

## Isaiah 14:13

You said in your heart, “I will ascend to the heavens; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of the north.

## Isaiah 14:14

I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.”

## Isaiah 14:15

Yet you are brought down to the realm of the dead, to the depths of the pit.

## Isaiah 14:16

Those who see you will gaze at you, they will ponder your fate: “Is this the man who made the earth tremble, who shook kingdoms,

## Isaiah 14:17

who made the world a wilderness, who overthrew its cities and did not let his captives go home?”

## Isaiah 14:18

All the kings of the nations lie in state, each in his own tomb.

## Isaiah 14:19

But you are cast out of your grave like a rejected branch, covered with the slain, those pierced by the sword, who descend to the stones of the pit, like a trampled corpse.

## Isaiah 14:20

You will not join them in burial, for you have destroyed your land and slain your people. May the offspring of evildoers never be mentioned again.

## Isaiah 14:21

Prepare a place to slaughter his children for the sins of their forefathers; they must not rise to inherit the land and fill the earth with their cities.

## Isaiah 14:22

“I will rise up against them,” declares the Lord Almighty, “and cut off from Babylon name and survivors, offspring and descendants,” declares the Lord.

## Isaiah 14:23

“I will turn her into a place for owls and into swamps; I will sweep her with the broom of destruction,” declares the Lord Almighty.

## Isaiah 14:24

The Lord Almighty has sworn: “Surely, as I have planned, so it will be, and as I have purposed, so it will stand.

## Isaiah 14:25

I will crush the Assyrian in my land; on my mountains I will trample him down. His yoke will be removed from my people, and his burden from their shoulders.”

## Isaiah 14:26

This is the plan devised against the whole earth; this is the hand stretched out over all the nations.

## Isaiah 14:27

For the Lord Almighty has purposed, and who can thwart it? His hand is stretched out, and who can turn it back?

## Isaiah 14:28

In the year King Ahaz died, this prophecy came:

## Isaiah 14:29

Do not rejoice, all you Philistines, that the rod that struck you is broken; from the root of that serpent will come forth a viper, its fruit will be a darting, venomous serpent.

## Isaiah 14:30

The poorest will find pasture, and the needy will lie down in safety. But I will destroy your root by famine; it will slay your survivors.

## Isaiah 14:31

Wail, you gate! Cry out, you city! Melt away, all you Philistines! A cloud of smoke comes from the north, and there is not a straggler in its ranks.

## Isaiah 14:32

What answer will be given to the envoys of that nation? “The Lord has established Zion, and in her the afflicted of his people will find refuge.”
