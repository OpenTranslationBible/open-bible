# Isaiah Chapter 15

## Isaiah 15:1  
The pronouncement concerning Moab:  
Certainly in a night Ar of Moab is devastated and ruined;  
Certainly in a night Kir of Moab is devastated and ruined.

## Isaiah 15:2  
They have gone up to the temple and to Dibon, to the high places to weep.  
Moab wails over Nebo and Medeba;  
Everyoneâ€™s head is bald and every beard is cut off.

## Isaiah 15:3  
In their streets they have put on sackcloth;  
On their rooftops and in their public squares  
Everyone is wailing, dissolved in tears.

## Isaiah 15:4  
Heshbon and Elealeh also cry out, their voice is heard all the way to Jahaz;  
Therefore the armed men of Moab shout in alarm;  
His soul trembles within him.

## Isaiah 15:5  
My heart cries out for Moab;  
Those who flee to Zoar and Eglath-shelishiyah,  
For they go up the ascent of Luhith weeping;  
Indeed, on the road to Horonaim they raise a cry of distress over their collapse.

## Isaiah 15:6  
For the waters of Nimrim are desolate.  
Indeed, the grass is withered, the new growth has died,  
There is no greenery.

## Isaiah 15:7  
Therefore the abundance they have acquired and stored up  
They carry off over the brook of Arabim.

## Isaiah 15:8  
For the cry of distress has gone around the territory of Moab,  
Its wailing goes as far as Eglaim and its wailing even to Beer-elim.

## Isaiah 15:9  
For the waters of Dimon are full of blood;  
Certainly I will bring added woes upon Dimon,  
A lion upon the fugitives of Moab and upon the remnant of the land.
