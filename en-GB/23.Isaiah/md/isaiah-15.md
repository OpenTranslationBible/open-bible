# Isaiah Chapter 15

## Isaiah 15:1
A declaration concerning Moab: Surely in a night Ar of Moab is devastated and laid waste; Surely in a night Kir of Moab is devastated and laid waste.

## Isaiah 15:2
The people ascend to the temple and to Dibon, to the high places to mourn. Moab laments over Nebo and Medeba; Every head is bald and every beard is shorn.

## Isaiah 15:3
In the streets they don sackcloth; On the rooftops and in the public squares, all are wailing, overwhelmed with tears.

## Isaiah 15:4
Heshbon and Elealeh cry out as well, Their voices reach all the way to Jahaz; Thus the warriors of Moab cry out; Their spirits tremble within them.

## Isaiah 15:5
My heart cries out for Moab; Its fugitives reach as far as Zoar and Eglath-shelishiyah. They ascend the slope of Luhith weeping; Indeed, on the path to Horonaim they raise cries of distress over their downfall.

## Isaiah 15:6
The waters of Nimrim are desolate. Truly, the grass is withered, the new growth has perished, No greenery remains.

## Isaiah 15:7
Thus the wealth they have gathered and stored, They carry away over the brook of the Poplars.

## Isaiah 15:8
For the cry of distress has encircled the land of Moab, Its lamentation reaches as far as Eglaim, its wailing to Beer-elim.

## Isaiah 15:9
For the waters of Dimon are filled with blood; I will surely bring further woes upon Dimon, A lion upon the fugitives of Moab and those remaining in the land.
