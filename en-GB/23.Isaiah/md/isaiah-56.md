# Isaiah Chapter 56

## Isaiah 56:1
This is what the Lord says: “Uphold justice and practise righteousness, for my salvation is near and my righteousness will soon be unveiled.

## Isaiah 56:2
Blessed is the individual who acts in this way, and the person who adheres to it; who refrains from desecrating the Sabbath, and keeps their hands from committing any evil.”

## Isaiah 56:3
Let not the foreigner who has aligned themselves with the Lord say, “The Lord will surely separate me from his people.” Nor let the eunuch declare, “I am merely a dry tree.”

## Isaiah 56:4
For this is what the Lord says: “To the eunuchs who observe my Sabbaths, who choose what delights me and hold firmly to my covenant—

## Isaiah 56:5
to them I will grant within my house and its walls a memorial and a name superior to that of sons and daughters; I will bestow upon them an everlasting name that shall never be cut off.

## Isaiah 56:6
And the foreigners who join themselves to the Lord to serve him, to love the name of the Lord, and to be his servants, everyone who keeps the Sabbath without desecrating it and holds firmly to my covenant—

## Isaiah 56:7
these I will bring to my holy mountain and make joyful in my house of prayer. Their burnt offerings and sacrifices will be accepted on my altar; for my house will be called a house of prayer for all peoples.”

## Isaiah 56:8
The Lord God, who gathers the scattered of Israel, proclaims, “I will gather yet others to them, in addition to those already gathered.”

## Isaiah 56:9
Come, all you wild creatures of the field, come and devour, all you creatures of the forest!

## Isaiah 56:10
His watchmen are blind, they all lack knowledge; they are all mute dogs, unable to bark; they lie around dreaming, loving to slumber.

## Isaiah 56:11
The dogs are voracious, they are never satisfied. They are shepherds who lack understanding; they have all turned to their own way, each seeking their own gain.

## Isaiah 56:12
“Come,” they say, “let us fetch wine, and drink our fill of strong drink; and tomorrow will be like today, even more abundant.”
