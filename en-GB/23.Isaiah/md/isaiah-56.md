# Isaiah Chapter 56

## Isaiah 56:1  
This is what the Lord says:  
“Guard justice and do righteousness,  
For My salvation is about to come  
And My righteousness to be revealed.

## Isaiah 56:2  
Blessed is a man who does this,  
And a son of man who takes hold of it;  
Who keeps the Sabbath without profaning it,  
And keeps his hand from doing any evil.”

## Isaiah 56:3  
Let not the foreigner who has joined himself to the Lord say,  
“The Lord will certainly separate me from His people.”  
Nor let the eunuch say, “Behold, I am a dry tree.”

## Isaiah 56:4  
For this is what the Lord says:  
“To the eunuchs who keep My Sabbaths,  
And choose what pleases Me,  
And hold firmly to My covenant,

## Isaiah 56:5  
To them I will give in My house and within My walls  
A memorial, and a name  
Better than that of sons and daughters;  
I will give them an everlasting name  
Which will not be eliminated.

## Isaiah 56:6  
Also the foreigners who join themselves to the Lord,  
To attend to His service and to love the name of the Lord,  
To be His servants,  
Everyone who keeps the Sabbath so as not to profane it,  
And holds firmly to My covenant;

## Isaiah 56:7  
Even those I will bring to My holy mountain,  
And make them joyful in My house of prayer.  
Their burnt offerings and their sacrifices will be acceptable on My altar;  
For My house will be called a house of prayer for all the peoples.”

## Isaiah 56:8  
The Lord God, who gathers the dispersed of Israel, declares:  
“I will yet gather others to them,  
To those already gathered.”

## Isaiah 56:9  
All you animals of the field,  
All you animals in the forest,  
Come to eat!

## Isaiah 56:10  
His watchmen are blind,  
All of them know nothing.  
All of them are mute dogs unable to bark,  
Dreamers lying down, who love to sleep;

## Isaiah 56:11  
And the dogs are greedy, they are never satisfied.  
And they are shepherds who have no understanding;  
They have all turned to their own way,  
Each one to his unjust gain, without exception.

## Isaiah 56:12  
“Come,” they say, “let’s get wine, and let’s drink heavily of intoxicating drink;  
And tomorrow will be like today, only more so.”
