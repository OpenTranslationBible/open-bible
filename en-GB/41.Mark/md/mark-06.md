# Mark Chapter 6

## Mark 6:1

Jesus departed from there and arrived in his hometown, with his disciples following him.

## Mark 6:2

When the Sabbath came, he began teaching in the synagogue, and many who listened were astonished. They asked, “Where did this man acquire these things? What is this wisdom that has been given to him, and what are these remarkable miracles performed by his hands?

## Mark 6:3

Is this not the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? Are not his sisters here with us?” And they took offence at him.

## Mark 6:4

Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honour except in his hometown, among his relatives, and in his own household.”

## Mark 6:5

He could not perform any miracles there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them.

## Mark 6:6

He was taken aback by their lack of faith. Then he continued teaching throughout the villages.

## Mark 6:7

He called the twelve to him and began to send them out in pairs, giving them authority over unclean spirits.

## Mark 6:8

He instructed them to take nothing for their journey except a staff—no bread, no bag, no money in their belts—

## Mark 6:9

but to wear sandals and not to put on two tunics.

## Mark 6:10

He said to them, “Wherever you enter a house, stay there until you leave that place.

## Mark 6:11

If any place does not welcome you or listen to you, as you leave, shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.”

## Mark 6:12

They went out and proclaimed that people should change their ways.

## Mark 6:13

They cast out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil, healing them.

## Mark 6:14

King Herod heard of this, for Jesus’ name had become well known. Some were saying, “John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why these miraculous powers are at work in him.”

## Mark 6:15

Others said, “He is Elijah.” Still others claimed, “He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.”

## Mark 6:16

But when Herod heard this, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has been raised!”

---

## Mark 6:17

Herod himself had ordered John’s arrest and had him bound and imprisoned because of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, whom he had married.

## Mark 6:18

For John had been saying to Herod, “It is against the law for you to have your brother’s wife.”

## Mark 6:19

Herodias held a grudge against him and wanted to kill him, but she could not,

## Mark 6:20

because Herod feared John and protected him, knowing him to be a righteous and holy man. When Herod listened to him, he was greatly perplexed, yet he enjoyed hearing him.

---

## Mark 6:21

An opportune day came when Herod, on his birthday, gave a banquet for his nobles, military commanders, and the leading men of Galilee.

## Mark 6:22

When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests. The king said to the girl, “Ask me for anything you want, and I will give it to you.”

## Mark 6:23

He swore to her, “Whatever you ask of me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom.”

## Mark 6:24

She went out and asked her mother, “What shall I request?” Her mother replied, “The head of John the Baptist.”

## Mark 6:25

Immediately she hurried to the king and requested, “I want you to give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter right now.”

## Mark 6:26

The king was deeply grieved, but because of his oaths and his guests, he did not want to refuse her.

## Mark 6:27

So he sent an executioner immediately with orders to bring John’s head. He went and beheaded John in the prison,

## Mark 6:28

and brought his head on a platter, presenting it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother.

## Mark 6:29

When John’s disciples heard of this, they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.

## Mark 6:30

The apostles gathered around Jesus and shared with him all they had done and taught.

## Mark 6:31

Then, because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have time to eat, he said to them, “Come away by yourselves to a quiet place and rest a while.”

## Mark 6:32

So they departed by themselves in a boat to a secluded area.

## Mark 6:33

But many saw them leaving and recognised them, and they ran on foot from all the towns and arrived ahead of them.

## Mark 6:34

When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he felt compassion for them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began to teach them many things.

---

## Mark 6:35

By this time it was late in the day, so his disciples came to him and said, “This is a remote place, and it is already very late.

## Mark 6:36

Send the people away so they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages to buy themselves something to eat.”

## Mark 6:37

But he replied, “You give them something to eat.” They said to him, “Should we go and spend two hundred denarii on bread and give it to them to eat?”

## Mark 6:38

He asked them, “How many loaves do you have? Go and find out.” When they found out, they said, “Five, and two fish.”

## Mark 6:39

Then he directed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass.

## Mark 6:40

So they sat down in organised groups.

## Mark 6:41

Taking the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed the food, broke the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to distribute to the people. He also divided the two fish among them all.

## Mark 6:42

They all ate and were satisfied,

## Mark 6:43

and the disciples picked up twelve baskets full of broken pieces of bread and fish.

## Mark 6:44

The number of men who ate the loaves was five thousand.

---

## Mark 6:45

Immediately, Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd.

## Mark 6:46

After sending them away, he went up on a mountainside to pray.

## Mark 6:47

As evening approached, the boat was in the middle of the sea, while he remained alone on the shore.

## Mark 6:48

Seeing them straining at the oars, because the wind was against them, shortly before dawn he went out to them, walking on the sea, intending to pass by them.

## Mark 6:49

But when they observed him walking on the sea, they thought it was a ghost and cried out,

## Mark 6:50

because they all saw him and were terrified. Immediately he spoke to them and said, “Take courage; it is I. Do not be afraid.”

## Mark 6:51

Then he got into the boat with them, and the wind ceased. They were utterly astonished,

## Mark 6:52

for they had not grasped the significance of the loaves; their hearts were hardened.

---

## Mark 6:53

When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and anchored there.

## Mark 6:54

Upon disembarking, people immediately recognised Jesus.

## Mark 6:55

They ran throughout the whole region and brought the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was.

## Mark 6:56

And wherever he went—into villages, towns, or the countryside—they placed the sick in the marketplaces and begged him to let them touch even the edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed.
