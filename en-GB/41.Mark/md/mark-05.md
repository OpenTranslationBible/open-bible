# Mark Chapter 5

## Mark 5:1

They crossed over to the other side of the sea, into the region of the Gerasenes.

## Mark 5:2

As Jesus got out of the boat, a man with an unclean spirit immediately came from the tombs to meet Him.

## Mark 5:3

This man lived among the tombs, and no one could bind him anymore, not even with chains.

## Mark 5:4

For he had often been bound with shackles and chains, but he tore the chains apart and broke the shackles; no one was strong enough to subdue him.

## Mark 5:5

Night and day among the tombs and in the hills, he would cry out and cut himself with stones.

---

## Mark 5:6

When he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and bowed down before Him.

## Mark 5:7

He shouted with a loud voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I implore you by God, do not torment me!”

## Mark 5:8

For Jesus had been saying to him, “Come out of this man, you unclean spirit!”

## Mark 5:9

Then Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” And he replied, “My name is Legion, for we are many.”

## Mark 5:10

And he begged Jesus repeatedly not to send them out of the region.

---

## Mark 5:11

A large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside.

## Mark 5:12

The demons pleaded with Jesus, “Send us into the pigs so that we may enter them.”

## Mark 5:13

He gave them permission, and the unclean spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd, about two thousand in number, rushed down the steep bank into the sea and were drowned.

---

## Mark 5:14

Those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside, and the people came to see what had happened.

## Mark 5:15

When they came to Jesus, they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.

## Mark 5:16

Those who had seen it described to the people what had happened to the demon-possessed man and about the pigs.

## Mark 5:17

Then the people began to plead with Jesus to leave their region.

---

## Mark 5:18

As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with Him.

## Mark 5:19

Jesus did not let him, but said, “Go home to your own people and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how He has had mercy on you.”

## Mark 5:20

So the man went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him. And all the people were amazed.

---

## Mark 5:21

When Jesus had crossed over again by boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered around Him while He was by the sea.

## Mark 5:22

Then one of the synagogue leaders, named Jairus, came, and when he saw Jesus, he fell at His feet.

## Mark 5:23

He pleaded earnestly with Him, “My little daughter is at the point of death. Please come and lay Your hands on her so that she will be healed and live.”

## Mark 5:24

So Jesus went with him. A large crowd followed and pressed around Him.

---

## Mark 5:25

And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years.

## Mark 5:26

She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse.

## Mark 5:27

When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind Him in the crowd and touched His cloak,

## Mark 5:28

because she thought, “If I just touch His clothes, I will be healed.”

## Mark 5:29

Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering.

## Mark 5:30

At once Jesus realised that power had gone out from Him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, “Who touched My clothes?”

## Mark 5:31

“You see the people crowding against You,” His disciples answered, “and yet You can ask, ‘Who touched Me?’”

## Mark 5:32

But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it.

## Mark 5:33

Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at His feet and, trembling with fear, told Him the whole truth.

## Mark 5:34

He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering.”

---

## Mark 5:35

While Jesus was still speaking, some people came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue leader. “Your daughter is dead,” they said. “Why bother the Teacher anymore?”

## Mark 5:36

Overhearing what they said, Jesus told him, “Do not be afraid; just believe.”

## Mark 5:37

He did not let anyone follow Him except Peter, James, and John the brother of James.

## Mark 5:38

When they came to the home of the synagogue leader, Jesus saw a commotion, with people crying and wailing loudly.

## Mark 5:39

He went in and said to them, “Why all this commotion and wailing? The child is not dead but asleep.”

## Mark 5:40

But they laughed at Him. After He put them all out, He took the child’s father and mother and the disciples who were with Him, and went in where the child was.

## Mark 5:41

He took her by the hand and said to her, “Talitha koum!” (which means, “Little girl, I say to you, get up!”).

## Mark 5:42

Immediately the girl stood up and began to walk around (she was twelve years old). At this they were completely astonished.

## Mark 5:43

He gave strict orders not to let anyone know about this, and told them to give her something to eat.
