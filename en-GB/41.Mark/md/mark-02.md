# Mark Chapter 2

## Mark 2:1

A few days later, when Jesus returned to Capernaum, it was reported that he was at home.

## Mark 2:2

A large crowd gathered, so much so that there was no room left, not even near the door, and he was speaking the word to them.

## Mark 2:3

Some people came, bringing a paralysed man, carried by four of them, to Jesus.

## Mark 2:4

Since they could not bring him to Jesus because of the crowd, they removed the roof above him, and after making an opening, they lowered the mat on which the paralysed man was lying.

## Mark 2:5

When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralysed man, “Son, your sins are forgiven.”

## Mark 2:6

But some of the teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves,

## Mark 2:7

“Why does this man speak like that? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?”

## Mark 2:8

Immediately Jesus, aware in his spirit that they were thinking this way within themselves, said to them, “Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?

## Mark 2:9

Which is easier: to say to this paralysed man, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, take your mat and walk’?

## Mark 2:10

But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—he said to the paralysed man,

## Mark 2:11

“I say to you, get up, take your mat and go home.”

## Mark 2:12

And he got up, took his mat, and walked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone, and they praised God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”

## Mark 2:13

Once again Jesus went out by the lakeside. A large crowd came to him, and he began to teach them.

## Mark 2:14

As he passed by, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector’s booth. “Follow me,” Jesus told him, and Levi got up and followed him.

---

## Mark 2:15

While Jesus was reclining at the table in Levi’s house, many tax collectors and sinners were dining with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.

## Mark 2:16

When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the sinners and tax collectors, they asked his disciples, “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?”

## Mark 2:17

On hearing this, Jesus said to them, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”

## Mark 2:18

Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came and asked Jesus, “Why do John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not?”

## Mark 2:19

Jesus answered, “Can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? As long as they have him with them, they cannot fast.

## Mark 2:20

But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast on that day.

## Mark 2:21

“No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. Otherwise, the new piece will pull away from the old, making the tear worse.

## Mark 2:22

And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into fresh wineskins.”

## Mark 2:23

And it happened that Jesus was going through the grainfields on the Sabbath, and his disciples began to pick some heads of grain as they walked along.

## Mark 2:24

The Pharisees said to him, “Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?”

## Mark 2:25

He said to them, “Have you never read what David did when he was in need and he and his companions were hungry;

## Mark 2:26

how he entered the house of God in the time of Abiathar the high priest and ate the consecrated bread, which is lawful only for priests to eat, and he also gave some to his companions?”

## Mark 2:27

Then he said to them, “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.

## Mark 2:28

So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.”
