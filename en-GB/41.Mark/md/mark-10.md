# Mark Chapter 10

## Mark 10:1

Setting out from there, Jesus _came_ into the region of Judea and beyond the Jordan;  
and crowds gathered to Him again, and, as was His custom, He once more began to teach them.

## Mark 10:2

And some Pharisees _came up to Jesus_, testing Him, and began questioning Him whether it was lawful for a man to divorce his wife.

## Mark 10:3

And He _answered and said to them_, “What did Moses command you?”

## Mark 10:4

They said, “Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away.”

## Mark 10:5

But Jesus said to them,  
“Because of your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment.

## Mark 10:6

But from the beginning of creation, God made them male and female.

## Mark 10:7

For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother,

## Mark 10:8

and the two shall become one flesh; so they are no longer two, but one flesh.

## Mark 10:9

Therefore, what God has joined together, no person is to separate.”

---

## Mark 10:10

And in the house the disciples again began questioning Him about this.

## Mark 10:11

And He _said to them_,  
“Whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her;

## Mark 10:12

and if she herself divorces her husband and marries another man, she is committing adultery.”

---

## Mark 10:13

And they were bringing children to Him so that He would touch them;  
but the disciples rebuked them.

## Mark 10:14

But when Jesus saw this, He was indignant and said to them,  
“Allow the children to come to Me; do not forbid them,  
for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.

## Mark 10:15

Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will not enter it at all.”

## Mark 10:16

And He took them in His arms and began blessing them, laying His hands on them.

---

## Mark 10:17

As He was setting out on a journey, a man ran up to Him and knelt before Him,  
and asked Him,  
“Good Teacher, what shall I do so that I may inherit eternal life?”

## Mark 10:18

But Jesus said to him,  
“Why do you call Me good? No one is good except God alone.

## Mark 10:19

You know the commandments: ‘Do not murder, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal,  
Do not give false testimony, Do not defraud, Honour your father and mother.’”

## Mark 10:20

And he _said to Him_,  
“Teacher, I have kept all these things from my youth.”

## Mark 10:21

Looking at him, Jesus showed love to him and said to him,  
“One thing you lack: go and sell all you possess and give to the poor,  
and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.”

## Mark 10:22

But he was deeply dismayed by these words, and he went away grieving;  
for he was one who owned much property.

---

## Mark 10:23

And Jesus, looking around, _said to His disciples_,  
“How hard it will be for those who are wealthy to enter the kingdom of God!”

## Mark 10:24

The disciples were amazed at His words. But Jesus _responded again_ and _said to them_,  
“Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!

## Mark 10:25

It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle  
than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.”

## Mark 10:26

And they were even more astonished, and _said to Him_, “Then who can be saved?”

## Mark 10:27

Looking at them, Jesus _said_,  
“With people it is impossible, but not with God; for all things are possible with God.”

---

## Mark 10:28

Peter began to say to Him,  
“Behold, we have left everything and have followed You.”

## Mark 10:29

Jesus _said_,  
“Truly I say to you, there is no one who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or mother,  
or father, or children, or farms, for My sake and for the gospel’s sake,

## Mark 10:30

but that he will receive a hundred times as much now in the present age—houses, brothers and sisters,  
mothers, children, and farms, along with persecutions—and in the age to come, eternal life.

## Mark 10:31

But many who are first will be last, and the last, first.”

---

## Mark 10:32

Now they were on the road going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead of them;  
and they were amazed, and those who followed were fearful.  
And again He took the twelve aside and began to tell them what was going to happen to Him,

## Mark 10:33

saying,  
“Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem,  
and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes;  
and they will condemn Him to death and hand Him over to the Gentiles.

## Mark 10:34

And they will mock Him, and spit on Him, and flog Him, and kill Him;  
and three days later He will rise from the dead.”

---

## Mark 10:35

James and John, the two sons of Zebedee, _came up to Jesus_, saying,  
“Teacher, we want You to do for us whatever we ask of You.”

## Mark 10:36

And He _said to them_, “What do you want Me to do for you?”

## Mark 10:37

They said to Him,  
“Grant that we may sit, one on Your right and one on Your left, in Your glory.”

## Mark 10:38

But Jesus _said to them_,  
“You do not know what you are asking.  
Are you able to drink the cup that I drink,  
or to be baptised with the baptism with which I am baptised?”

## Mark 10:39

They _said to Him_, “We are able.”  
And Jesus _said to them_,  
“The cup that I drink you shall drink; and you shall be baptised with the baptism with which I am baptised.

## Mark 10:40

But to sit on My right or on My left is not Mine to give,  
but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.”

---

## Mark 10:41

Hearing this, the other ten began to feel indignant with James and John.

## Mark 10:42

Calling them to Himself, Jesus _said to them_,  
“You know that those who are recognised as rulers of the Gentiles domineer over them;  
and their people in high positions exercise authority over them.

## Mark 10:43

But it is not this way among you; rather, whoever wants to become prominent among you shall be your servant;

## Mark 10:44

and whoever wants to be first among you shall be slave of all.

## Mark 10:45

For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve,  
and to give His life as a ransom for many.”

---

## Mark 10:46

Then they _came to Jericho_.  
And as He was leaving Jericho with His disciples and a large crowd,  
a blind beggar named Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, was sitting by the road.

## Mark 10:47

When he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene,  
he began to cry out and say,  
“Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”

## Mark 10:48

Many were sternly telling him to be quiet, but he kept crying out all the more,  
“Son of David, have mercy on me!”

## Mark 10:49

And Jesus stopped and said, “Call him here.”  
So they _called the man who was blind_, saying to him,  
“Take courage, stand up! He is calling for you.”

## Mark 10:50

And throwing off his cloak, he jumped up and came to Jesus.

## Mark 10:51

And Jesus responded to him and said,  
“What do you want Me to do for you?”  
And the man who was blind said to Him, “Rabboni, I want to regain my sight!”

## Mark 10:52

And Jesus said to him,  
“Go; your faith has made you well.”  
And immediately he regained his sight and began following Him on the road.
