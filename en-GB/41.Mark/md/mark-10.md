# Mark Chapter 10

## Mark 10:1

Jesus departed from there and travelled to the region of Judea and beyond the Jordan. Crowds gathered around Him once more, and, as was His custom, He began to teach them again.

## Mark 10:2

Some Pharisees approached Him, testing Him by asking whether it was lawful for a man to divorce his wife.

## Mark 10:3

He responded, “What did Moses command you?”

## Mark 10:4

They replied, “Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away.”

## Mark 10:5

Jesus said to them, “It was due to the hardness of your hearts that he wrote you this commandment.

## Mark 10:6

But from the beginning of creation, God made them male and female.

## Mark 10:7

For this reason, a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife,

## Mark 10:8

and the two shall become one flesh; so they are no longer two, but one flesh.

## Mark 10:9

Therefore, what God has joined together, let no one separate.”

---

## Mark 10:10

When they were back in the house, the disciples questioned Him about this matter.

## Mark 10:11

He said to them, “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her;

## Mark 10:12

and if a woman separates from her husband and marries another man, she is considered to have committed adultery.”

---

## Mark 10:13

People were bringing little children to Jesus for Him to touch them, but the disciples rebuked them.

## Mark 10:14

When Jesus saw this, He was indignant and said to them, “Let the children come to Me; do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.

## Mark 10:15

I assure you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God with the heart of a child will never enter it.”

## Mark 10:16

And He embraced the children, placed His hands on them, and blessed them.

---

## Mark 10:17

As He set out on a journey, a man ran up to Him, knelt before Him, and asked, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”

## Mark 10:18

Jesus replied, “Why do you call Me good? No one is good except God alone.

## Mark 10:19

You know the commandments: ‘Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony, do not defraud, honour your father and mother.’”

## Mark 10:20

He said to Him, “Teacher, I have observed all these from my youth.”

## Mark 10:21

Looking at him, Jesus loved him and said, “One thing you lack: go, sell all you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow Me.”

## Mark 10:22

At this, the man's face fell, and he went away grieving, for he had great wealth.

---

## Mark 10:23

Jesus looked around and said to His disciples, “How difficult it is for those who are wealthy to enter the kingdom of God!”

## Mark 10:24

The disciples were amazed at His words. But Jesus said again, “Children, how challenging it is to enter the kingdom of God!

## Mark 10:25

It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.”

## Mark 10:26

They were even more astonished and said to one another, “Who then is able to be saved?”

## Mark 10:27

Jesus looked at them and said, “With man it is impossible, but not with God; for with God, all things are possible.”

---

## Mark 10:28

Peter began to say to Him, “We have left everything to follow You!”

## Mark 10:29

Jesus replied, “Truly I tell you, there is no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for My sake and for the gospel

## Mark 10:30

who will not receive a hundred times as much in this present age: homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and fields—along with persecutions—and in the age to come, eternal life.

## Mark 10:31

But many who are first will be last, and the last first.”

---

## Mark 10:32

They were on the road going up to Jerusalem, with Jesus leading the way, and the disciples were astonished, while those who followed were afraid. Again He took the Twelve aside and began to tell them what was going to happen to Him.

## Mark 10:33

“We are going up to Jerusalem,” He said, “and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes. They will condemn Him to death and hand Him over to the Gentiles,

## Mark 10:34

who will mock Him, spit on Him, flog Him, and kill Him. Three days later He will rise.”

---

## Mark 10:35

Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to Him and said, “Teacher, we want You to do for us whatever we ask.”

## Mark 10:36

“What is it that you wish Me to do for you?” He asked.

## Mark 10:37

They replied, “Allow one of us to sit at Your right and the other at Your left in Your glory.”

## Mark 10:38

Jesus said to them, “You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup I drink or be baptised with the baptism I am baptised with?”

## Mark 10:39

“We can,” they answered. Jesus said to them, “You will indeed drink the cup I drink and be baptised with the baptism I am baptised with,

## Mark 10:40

but to sit at My right or left is not for Me to grant. These places are reserved for those for whom they have been prepared.”

---

## Mark 10:41

When the ten heard about this, they became upset with James and John.

## Mark 10:42

Jesus called them together and said, “You know that those who are regarded as rulers of the Gentiles dominate them, and their high officials exercise authority over them.

## Mark 10:43

But it shall not be so among you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,

## Mark 10:44

and whoever wants to be first must be the slave of all.

## Mark 10:45

For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many.”

---

## Mark 10:46

Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus and His disciples, together with a large crowd, were leaving the city, a blind man named Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, was sitting by the roadside begging.

## Mark 10:47

Upon hearing that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”

## Mark 10:48

Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet, but he cried out even more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”

## Mark 10:49

Jesus stopped and said, “Call him.” So they called to the blind man, “Take courage, get up! He is calling you.”

## Mark 10:50

Casting aside his cloak, he sprang up and came to Jesus.

## Mark 10:51

“What is it you wish Me to do for you?” Jesus asked him. The blind man said, “Rabbi, I wish to see.”

## Mark 10:52

Jesus said to him, “Go, your faith has healed you.” Immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus along the road.
