# Mark Chapter 12

## Mark 12:1

Jesus began to speak to them in parables: “A man planted a vineyard. He put a fence around it, dug a pit for the winepress, and built a tower. Then he leased it to some farmers and went on a journey.

## Mark 12:2

When the time came for the harvest, he sent a servant to the tenants to gather some of the vineyard's fruit from them.

## Mark 12:3

But they seized him, beat him, and sent him away with nothing.

## Mark 12:4

Then he sent another servant to them; they struck him on the head and treated him shamefully.

## Mark 12:5

He sent another, and that one they killed. He sent many others; some they beat, others they killed.

## Mark 12:6

He had one left to send, a beloved son. He sent him last of all, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’

## Mark 12:7

But the tenants said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’

## Mark 12:8

So they took him, ended his life, and cast him out of the vineyard.

## Mark 12:9

What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and put the tenants to death and give the vineyard to others.

## Mark 12:10

Have you not read this passage of Scripture: ‘The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone;

## Mark 12:11

the Lord has done this, and it is wonderful in our eyes’?”

## Mark 12:12

Then the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders looked for a way to arrest him, because they knew he had spoken the parable against them. But they feared the people, so they left him and went away.

## Mark 12:13

Later they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to Jesus to try to trap him in his words.

## Mark 12:14

They came and said to him, “Teacher, we know that you are a man of integrity and are not swayed by others, because you do not show partiality, but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it right to pay the imperial tax to Caesar or not?

## Mark 12:15

Should we pay or shouldn’t we?” But Jesus, knowing their hypocrisy, said, “Why are you trying to trap me? Bring me a denarius to look at.”

## Mark 12:16

They presented the coin, and he asked them, “Whose likeness is this? And whose inscription?” “Caesar’s,” they replied.

## Mark 12:17

Then Jesus said to them, “Give back to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and to God what belongs to God.” And they were amazed at him.

## Mark 12:18

Then some Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question.

## Mark 12:19

“Teacher,” they said, “Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother passes away and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother.

## Mark 12:20

There were seven brothers. The first one married and died without leaving any children.

## Mark 12:21

The second one married the widow, but he also died, leaving no child. The same happened with the third.

## Mark 12:22

Indeed, none of the seven left any children. Last of all, the woman died too.

## Mark 12:23

In the resurrection, whose wife will she be, since all seven were married to her?”

## Mark 12:24

Jesus replied, “Are you not mistaken because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God?

## Mark 12:25

When the dead are raised, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven.

## Mark 12:26

Now concerning the rising of the dead—have you not read in the Book of Moses, in the account of the burning bush, how God said to him, ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’?

## Mark 12:27

He is the God of the living, not of the dead. You are indeed mistaken!”

## Mark 12:28

One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a wise answer, he asked him, “Of all the commandments, which is the most important?”

## Mark 12:29

“The foremost one,” answered Jesus, “is this: ‘Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord.

## Mark 12:30

Love the Lord your God with all of your heart, with all of your soul, with all of your mind, and with all of your strength.’

## Mark 12:31

The second is: ‘Love your neighbour as yourself.’ No other commandments are greater than these.”

## Mark 12:32

“Well said, teacher,” the man agreed. “For you are indeed right to say that God is one and there is no other but him.

## Mark 12:33

You are right to say love him with all your heart, with all your understanding, and with all your strength, and you are right to say loving your neighbour as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.”

## Mark 12:34

When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, “You are not far from the kingdom of God.” And from that time on, no one dared ask him any more questions.

## Mark 12:35

While he was teaching in the temple courts, Jesus asked, “Why is it the teachers of the law say that the Messiah is the son of David?

## Mark 12:36

David himself, speaking by the Holy Spirit, declared:

> ‘The Lord said to my Lord:
> “Sit at my right hand
> until I put your enemies
> under your feet.”’

## Mark 12:37

If David himself calls him ‘Lord.’ How then can he be his son?” The large crowd listened to him delighted.

## Mark 12:38

As he taught, Jesus said, “Watch out for the teachers of the law. They like to walk around in long robes and be greeted with respect in the marketplaces,

## Mark 12:39

and have the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honour at banquets.

## Mark 12:40

They consume widows’ houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. These men will be punished most severely.”

## Mark 12:41

Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and observed the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury. Many rich people contributed large amounts.

## Mark 12:42

But a poor widow came and placed in two very small copper coins, worth only a few pence.

## Mark 12:43

Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, “Truly I tell you, this poor widow has contributed more to the treasury than all the others.

## Mark 12:44

They all gave out of their abundance; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything—all she had to live on.”
