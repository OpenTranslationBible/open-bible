# Mark Chapter 1

## Mark 1:1

The beginning of the gospel about Jesus Christ, the Son of God,

## Mark 1:2

as it is written in the prophet Isaiah:

> “Behold, I will send my messenger ahead of you,
> who will prepare Your way;

## Mark 1:3

> A voice of one calling in the wilderness:
> ‘Prepare the way for the Lord;
> make straight in the desert a highway for our God’”

## Mark 1:4

John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.

## Mark 1:5

The entire Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him. Confessing their sins, they were baptised by him in the River Jordan.

## Mark 1:6

John was clothed in camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.

## Mark 1:7

And he proclaimed, “After me comes one more powerful than I, whose sandal straps I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.

## Mark 1:8

I baptise you with water, but he will immerse you in the Holy Spirit.”

---

## Mark 1:9

During that time, Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptised by John in the Jordan.

## Mark 1:10

As soon as Jesus came up out of the water, he saw the heavens being opened and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.

## Mark 1:11

And a voice from heaven said, “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.”

---

## Mark 1:12

Immediately the Spirit sent him out into the wilderness,

## Mark 1:13

and he was in the wilderness for forty days, facing temptations from Satan. He was with the wild animals, and angels attended him.

---

## Mark 1:14

After John was arrested, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of God.

## Mark 1:15

“The time is complete,” he said. “The kingdom of God is near. Turn and believe in the gospel!”

---

## Mark 1:16

As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.

## Mark 1:17

“Come, follow me,” Jesus said, “and I will make you fishers of people.”

## Mark 1:18

Immediately they left their nets and followed him.

## Mark 1:19

When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, mending their nets.

## Mark 1:20

He called them without delay, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.

---

## Mark 1:21

They went to Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath Jesus entered the synagogue and began to teach.

## Mark 1:22

The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not as the scribes.

## Mark 1:23

Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an unclean spirit cried out,

## Mark 1:24

“What do you have to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know you —you are the Holy One of God!”

## Mark 1:25

Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be quiet! Come out of him!”

## Mark 1:26

The unclean spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a loud cry.

## Mark 1:27

The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, “What is this? A new teaching—with authority! He even commands unclean spirits, and they obey him.”

## Mark 1:28

Immediately the news about him spread throughout the whole region of Galilee.

---

## Mark 1:29

Upon leaving the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew.

## Mark 1:30

Simon’s mother-in-law was in bed with a fever, and they promptly informed Jesus about her.

## Mark 1:31

So he went to her, took her by the hand and helped her up. The fever left her, and she began to wait on them.

---

## Mark 1:32

That evening, after sunset, the people brought to Jesus all who were sick and those possessed by demons.

## Mark 1:33

The whole town gathered at the door,

## Mark 1:34

and Jesus healed many who had various diseases. He also drove out many demons, but he would not let the demons speak because they recognised him.

---

## Mark 1:35

Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went to a solitary place, where he prayed.

## Mark 1:36

Simon and his companions went looking for him,

## Mark 1:37

and when they found him, they said, “Everyone is searching for you!”

## Mark 1:38

Jesus replied, “Let us go to another place—to the nearby villages—so I can preach there also. That is why I have come.”

## Mark 1:39

So he journeyed throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons.

---

## Mark 1:40

A man with leprosy approached him and pleaded on his knees, “If you are willing, you can make me clean.”

## Mark 1:41

Filled with compassion, Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man. “I am willing,” he said. “Be clean!”

## Mark 1:42

At once the leprosy left him, and he was cleansed.

## Mark 1:43

Jesus sent him away at once with a stern warning:

## Mark 1:44

“Ensure that you tell no one about this. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.”

## Mark 1:45

However, he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, Jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in secluded places. Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.
