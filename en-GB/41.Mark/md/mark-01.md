# Mark Chapter 1

## Mark 1:1

The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.

## Mark 1:2

Just as it is written in Isaiah the prophet:

> “Behold, I am sending My messenger ahead of You,  
> Who will prepare Your way;

## Mark 1:3

> The voice of one calling out in the wilderness,  
> ‘Prepare the way of the Lord,  
> Make His paths straight!’”

## Mark 1:4

John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness,  
preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.

## Mark 1:5

And all the region of Judea was going out to him, and all the people of Jerusalem;  
and they were being baptised by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.

## Mark 1:6

John was clothed with camel’s hair and wore a leather belt around his waist,  
and his diet was locusts and wild honey.

## Mark 1:7

And he was preaching, saying,  
“After me One is coming who is mightier than I,  
and I am not fit to bend down and untie the straps of His sandals.

## Mark 1:8

I baptised you with water; but He will baptise you with the Holy Spirit.”

---

## Mark 1:9

In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee,  
and was baptised by John in the Jordan.

## Mark 1:10

And immediately coming up out of the water,  
He saw the heavens opening, and the Spirit, like a dove, descending upon Him;

## Mark 1:11

and a voice came from the heavens:  
“You are My beloved Son; in You I am well pleased.”

---

## Mark 1:12

And immediately the Spirit _brought Him out_ into the wilderness.

## Mark 1:13

And He was in the wilderness for forty days, being tempted by Satan;  
and He was with the wild animals, and the angels were serving Him.

---

## Mark 1:14

Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee,  
preaching the gospel of God,

## Mark 1:15

and saying,  
“The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand;  
repent and believe in the gospel.”

---

## Mark 1:16

As He was going along the Sea of Galilee,  
He saw Simon and Andrew, the brother of Simon, casting a net in the sea; for they were fishermen.

## Mark 1:17

And Jesus said to them,  
“Follow Me, and I will make you become fishers of people.”

## Mark 1:18

Immediately they left their nets and followed Him.

## Mark 1:19

And going on a little farther, He saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother,  
who were also in the boat mending the nets.

## Mark 1:20

Immediately He called them; and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men, and went away to follow Him.

---

## Mark 1:21

They _went into_ Capernaum; and immediately on the Sabbath Jesus entered the synagogue and began to teach.

## Mark 1:22

And they were amazed at His teaching;  
for He was teaching them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes.

## Mark 1:23

And just then there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,

## Mark 1:24

saying, “What business do You have with us, Jesus of Nazareth?  
Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are—the Holy One of God!”

## Mark 1:25

And Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be quiet, and come out of him!”

## Mark 1:26

After throwing him into convulsions and crying out with a loud voice,  
the unclean spirit came out of him.

## Mark 1:27

And they were all amazed, so they debated among themselves, saying,  
“What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him.”

## Mark 1:28

Immediately the news about Him spread everywhere into all the surrounding region of Galilee.

---

## Mark 1:29

And immediately after they left the synagogue,  
they entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.

## Mark 1:30

Now Simon’s mother-in-law was lying sick with a fever; and they immediately _spoke to Jesus_ about her.

## Mark 1:31

And He came to her and raised her up, taking her by the hand, and the fever left her, and she served them.

---

## Mark 1:32

Now when evening came, after the sun had set,  
they began bringing to Him all who were ill and those who were demon-possessed.

## Mark 1:33

And the whole city had gathered at the door.

## Mark 1:34

And He healed many who were ill with various diseases, and cast out many demons;  
and He would not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who He was.

---

## Mark 1:35

And in the early morning, while it was still dark,  
Jesus got up, left the house, and went away to a secluded place, and prayed there for a time.

## Mark 1:36

Simon and his companions eagerly searched for Him;

## Mark 1:37

and they found Him and _said to Him_,  
“Everyone is looking for You!”

## Mark 1:38

He _said to them_,  
“Let’s go somewhere else to the towns nearby, so that I may preach there also;  
for that is what I came for.”

## Mark 1:39

And He went into their synagogues preaching throughout Galilee, and casting out the demons.

---

## Mark 1:40

And a man with leprosy _came to Jesus_, imploring Him and kneeling down, and saying to Him,  
“If You are willing, You can make me clean.”

## Mark 1:41

Moved with compassion, Jesus reached out with His hand and touched him, and _said to him_,  
“I am willing; be cleansed.”

## Mark 1:42

And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was cleansed.

## Mark 1:43

And He sternly warned him and immediately sent him away,

## Mark 1:44

and _said to him_,  
“See that you say nothing to anyone;  
but go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.”

## Mark 1:45

But he went out and began to proclaim it freely and to spread the news around,  
to such an extent that Jesus could no longer publicly enter a city,  
but stayed out in unpopulated areas; and they were coming to Him from everywhere.
