# Mark Chapter 7

## Mark 7:1

The Pharisees and some of the scribes gathered around Jesus after they had come from Jerusalem,

## Mark 7:2

and noticed that some of His disciples were eating with hands that were considered unclean, that is, unwashed.

## Mark 7:3

(For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they perform a ceremonial washing of their hands, adhering to the tradition of the elders;

## Mark 7:4

and when they return from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash. They also observe many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, pitchers, and copper vessels.)

## Mark 7:5

So the Pharisees and the scribes asked Him, “Why do Your disciples not follow the tradition of the elders, but eat with unclean hands?”

## Mark 7:6

He responded, “Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites, as it is written:

> ‘These people honour Me with their lips,
> but their hearts are far from Me.

## Mark 7:7

> They worship Me in vain;
> their teachings are merely human commandments.’

## Mark 7:8

You have set aside the command of God and hold to human traditions.”

## Mark 7:9

And He continued, “You have a clever way of rejecting the command of God in order to keep your own tradition!

## Mark 7:10

For Moses said, ‘Honour your father and your mother,’ and, ‘Anyone who curses their father or mother must be put to death.’

## Mark 7:11

But you say that if someone declares that what might have been used to help their father or mother is Corban (that is, dedicated to God)—

## Mark 7:12

then you no longer allow them to do anything for their father or mother.

## Mark 7:13

In this way, you make void the word of God by your tradition that you have passed down. And you engage in many similar practices.”

## Mark 7:14

Then Jesus called the crowd to Him again and said, “Listen to Me, all of you, and understand:

## Mark 7:15

Nothing external to a person can defile them by entering them. Rather, it is what emerges from a person that defiles them.”

## Mark 7:16

[If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.”]

## Mark 7:17

After leaving the crowd and entering the house, His disciples asked Him about the parable.

## Mark 7:18

He said to them, “Are you also lacking in understanding? Do you not see that whatever enters a person from outside cannot defile them,

## Mark 7:19

because it does not go into their heart but into their stomach, and then is expelled?” (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods clean.)

## Mark 7:20

He went on to say, “What comes out of a person is what defiles them.

## Mark 7:21

For from within, out of the heart of men, come evil thoughts: sexual immorality, theft, murder,

## Mark 7:22

adultery, greed, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride, and foolishness.

## Mark 7:23

All these harmful things come from within and defile a person.”

## Mark 7:24

Jesus left that place and went to the region of Tyre. He entered a house and did not want anyone to know it, yet He could not remain hidden.

## Mark 7:25

But a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit heard about Him and came and fell at His feet.

## Mark 7:26

The woman was a Gentile, of Syrophoenician origin. She begged Him to drive the demon out of her daughter.

## Mark 7:27

He said to her, “Let the children be fed first, for it is not right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”

## Mark 7:28

But she replied, “Yes, Lord, but even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.”

## Mark 7:29

Then He said to her, “For this answer, you may go; the demon has left your daughter.”

## Mark 7:30

She went home and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon had departed.

## Mark 7:31

Jesus left the region of Tyre and went through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, into the region of the Decapolis.

## Mark 7:32

There some people brought to Him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk, and they begged Him to lay His hand on him.

## Mark 7:33

Jesus took him aside, away from the crowd, and put His fingers into the man’s ears. Then He spat and touched the man’s tongue.

## Mark 7:34

He looked upward, sighed deeply, and said to him, “Ephphatha!” (which means “Be opened!”).

## Mark 7:35

At this, the man’s ears were opened, his tongue was loosened, and he began to speak clearly.

## Mark 7:36

Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone. But the more He did so, the more they kept spreading the news.

## Mark 7:37

People were utterly amazed and said, “He has done everything well; He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.”
