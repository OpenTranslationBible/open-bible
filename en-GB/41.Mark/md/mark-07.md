# Mark Chapter 7

## Mark 7:1

The Pharisees and some of the scribes gathered to Him after they came from Jerusalem,

## Mark 7:2

and saw that some of His disciples were eating their bread with unholy hands, that is, unwashed.

## Mark 7:3

(For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they carefully wash their hands,  
thereby holding firmly to the tradition of the elders;

## Mark 7:4

and when they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they completely cleanse themselves;  
and there are many other things which they have received as traditions to firmly hold,  
such as the washing of cups, pitchers, and copper pots.)

## Mark 7:5

And the Pharisees and the scribes _asked Him_,  
“Why do Your disciples not walk in accordance with the tradition of the elders,  
but eat their bread with unholy hands?”

## Mark 7:6

But He said to them,  
“Rightly did Isaiah prophesy about you hypocrites, as it is written:

> ‘This people honours Me with their lips,  
> But their heart is far away from Me.

## Mark 7:7

> And in vain do they worship Me,  
> Teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’

## Mark 7:8

Neglecting the commandment of God, you hold to the tradition of men.”

## Mark 7:9

He was also saying to them,  
“You are experts at setting aside the commandment of God in order to keep your tradition.

## Mark 7:10

For Moses said, ‘Honour your father and your mother’;  
and, ‘The one who speaks evil of father or mother is certainly to be put to death’;

## Mark 7:11

but you say, ‘If a person says to his father or mother,  
“Whatever I have that would help you is Corban (that is, given to God),”’

## Mark 7:12

you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother;

## Mark 7:13

thereby invalidating the word of God by your tradition which you have handed down;  
and you do many things such as that.”

## Mark 7:14

After He called the crowd to Him again, He began saying to them,  
“Listen to Me, all of you, and understand:

## Mark 7:15

there is nothing outside the person which can defile him if it goes into him;  
but the things which come out of the person are what defile the person.”

## Mark 7:16

[If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.”]

## Mark 7:17

And when He later entered a house away from the crowd,  
His disciples asked Him about the parable.

## Mark 7:18

And He _said to them_,  
“Are you so lacking in understanding as well?  
Do you not understand that whatever goes into the person from outside cannot defile him,

## Mark 7:19

because it does not go into his heart, but into his stomach, and is eliminated?”  
(Thereby He declared all foods clean.)

## Mark 7:20

And He was saying,  
“That which comes out of the person, that is what defiles the person.

## Mark 7:21

For from within, out of the hearts of people, come the evil thoughts,  
acts of sexual immorality, thefts, murders, adulteries,

## Mark 7:22

acts of greed, wickedness, deceit, indecent behaviour, envy, slander, pride, and foolishness.

## Mark 7:23

All these evil things come from within and defile the person.”

## Mark 7:24

Jesus got up and went away from there to the region of Tyre.  
And when He had entered a house, He wanted no one to know about it; and yet He could not escape notice.

## Mark 7:25

But after hearing about Him, a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit  
immediately came and fell at His feet.

## Mark 7:26

Now the woman was a Gentile, of Syrophoenician descent.  
And she repeatedly asked Him to cast the demon out of her daughter.

## Mark 7:27

And He was saying to her,  
“Let the children be satisfied first, for it is not good to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”

## Mark 7:28

But she answered and _said to Him_,  
“Yes, Lord, but even the dogs under the table feed on the children’s crumbs.”

## Mark 7:29

And He _said to her_,  
“Because of this answer, go; the demon has gone out of your daughter.”

## Mark 7:30

And after going back to her home, she found the child lying on the bed, and the demon gone.

## Mark 7:31

Again He left the region of Tyre, and came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee,  
within the region of the Decapolis.

## Mark 7:32

And they _brought to Him_ a man who was deaf and had difficulty speaking,  
and they _begged Him_ to lay His hand on him.

## Mark 7:33

And Jesus took him aside from the crowd, by himself,  
and put His fingers in his ears, and after spitting, He touched his tongue with the saliva;

## Mark 7:34

and looking up to heaven with a deep sigh, He _said to him_,  
“Ephphatha!” that is, “Be opened!”

## Mark 7:35

And his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was removed, and he began speaking plainly.

## Mark 7:36

And He gave them orders not to tell anyone;  
but the more He ordered them, the more widely they continued to proclaim it.

## Mark 7:37

And they were utterly astonished, saying,  
“He has done all things well; He makes even those who are deaf hear, and those who are mute speak.”
