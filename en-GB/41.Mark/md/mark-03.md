# Mark Chapter 3

## Mark 3:1

Jesus entered the synagogue once more, and there was a man present with a withered hand.

## Mark 3:2

They were observing Him closely to see if He would heal the man on the Sabbath, intending to accuse Him.

## Mark 3:3

Jesus said to the man with the withered hand, “Stand up here in front of everyone.”

## Mark 3:4

He then asked them, “Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath or to do harm, to save life or to destroy it?” But they remained silent.

## Mark 3:5

Looking around at them with anger, and grieved by their hard hearts, He said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out, and his hand was restored.

## Mark 3:6

The Pharisees went out and immediately began to conspire with the Herodians against Him, considering how to destroy Him.

## Mark 3:7

Jesus withdrew with His disciples to the sea, and a large crowd from Galilee followed Him.

## Mark 3:8

When they heard about all He was doing, a great number of people came to Him from Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan, and the vicinity of Tyre and Sidon.

## Mark 3:9

He told His disciples to have a small boat ready for Him because of the crowd, to prevent them from crushing Him.

## Mark 3:10

For He had healed many, so that those with diseases were pressing forward to touch Him.

## Mark 3:11

Whenever the unclean spirits saw Him, they would fall down before Him and exclaim, “You are the Son of God.”

## Mark 3:12

But He firmly instructed them not to reveal His identity.

---

## Mark 3:13

He went up on a mountainside and called to Him those He wanted, and they came to Him.

## Mark 3:14

He appointed twelve, so that they might be with Him and that He might send them out to preach

## Mark 3:15

and to have authority to cast out demons.

## Mark 3:16

These are the twelve He chose: Simon (to whom He gave the name Peter),

## Mark 3:17

James, the son of Zebedee, and John, the brother of James (to whom He gave the name Boanerges, meaning “sons of thunder”),

## Mark 3:18

Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James, the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot,

## Mark 3:19

and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Him.

---

## Mark 3:20

Then He went home, and once again a crowd gathered, so that He and His disciples could not even eat.

## Mark 3:21

When His family heard about this, they sought to take charge of Him, saying, “He is out of His mind.”

---

## Mark 3:22

And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, “He is possessed by Beelzebul! By the prince of demons He drives out demons.”

## Mark 3:23

So He called them to Himself and began to speak to them in parables: “How can Satan drive out Satan?

## Mark 3:24

If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.

## Mark 3:25

If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.

## Mark 3:26

And if Satan is in conflict with himself and is divided, he cannot endure; his end has come.

## Mark 3:27

No one can enter a strong man’s house and plunder his goods unless he first binds the strong man. Then he can plunder his house.

## Mark 3:28

Truly I tell you, people can be forgiven all their sins and whatever blasphemies they utter,

## Mark 3:29

but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; they are guilty of an unending sin.”

## Mark 3:30

He said this because they were saying, “He has an unclean spirit.”

---

## Mark 3:31

Then His mother and His brothers arrived. Standing outside, they sent someone in to call Him.

## Mark 3:32

A crowd was sitting around Him, and they said to Him, “Your mother and brothers are outside looking for You.”

## Mark 3:33

“Who are considered My mother and My brothers?” He asked.

## Mark 3:34

Looking at those seated in a circle around Him, He said, “Here are My mother and My brothers!

## Mark 3:35

Whoever does the will of God is My brother, sister, and mother.”
