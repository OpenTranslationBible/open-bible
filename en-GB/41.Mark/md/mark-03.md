# Mark Chapter 3

## Mark 3:1

He entered a synagogue again; and a man was there whose hand was withered.

## Mark 3:2

And they were watching Him closely to see if He would heal him on the Sabbath,  
so that they might accuse Him.

## Mark 3:3

He _said to the man_ with the withered hand, “Get up and come forward!”

## Mark 3:4

And He _said to them_,  
“Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath or to do harm, to save a life or to kill?”  
But they kept silent.

## Mark 3:5

After looking around at them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart,  
He _said to the man_, “Stretch out your hand.”  
And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored.

## Mark 3:6

The Pharisees went out and immediately began conspiring with the Herodians against Him,  
as to how they might put Him to death.

## Mark 3:7

Jesus withdrew to the sea with His disciples; and a large multitude from Galilee followed,  
and also from Judea,

## Mark 3:8

and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and beyond the Jordan,  
and the vicinity of Tyre and Sidon, a great number of people came to Him  
when they heard about everything that He was doing.

## Mark 3:9

And He told His disciples to see that a boat would be ready for Him because of the crowd,  
so that they would not crowd Him;

## Mark 3:10

for He had healed many,  
with the result that all those who had diseases pushed in around Him in order to touch Him.

## Mark 3:11

And whenever the unclean spirits saw Him,  
they would fall down before Him and shout, “You are the Son of God!”

## Mark 3:12

And He strongly warned them not to reveal who He was.

---

## Mark 3:13

And He _went up on the mountain_ and _summoned those whom He Himself wanted_, and they came to Him.

## Mark 3:14

And He appointed twelve, so that they would be with Him and that He could send them out to preach,

## Mark 3:15

and to have authority to cast out the demons.

## Mark 3:16

And He appointed the twelve: Simon (to whom He gave the name Peter),

## Mark 3:17

James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James (to them He gave the name Boanerges,  
which means, “Sons of Thunder”);

## Mark 3:18

and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas,  
and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot;

## Mark 3:19

and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him.

---

## Mark 3:20

And He _came home_, and the crowd gathered again,  
to such an extent that they could not even eat a meal.

## Mark 3:21

And when His own people heard about this,  
they came out to take custody of Him; for they were saying, “He has lost His senses.”

---

## Mark 3:22

The scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying,  
“He is possessed by Beelzebul,” and “He casts out the demons by the ruler of the demons.”

## Mark 3:23

So He called them to Himself and began speaking to them in parables:  
“How can Satan cast out Satan?

## Mark 3:24

And if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.

## Mark 3:25

And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.

## Mark 3:26

And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but he is finished!

## Mark 3:27

But no one can enter the strong man’s house and plunder his property  
unless he first ties up the strong man, and then he will plunder his house.

## Mark 3:28

Truly I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons and daughters of men,  
and whatever blasphemies they commit;

## Mark 3:29

but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness,  
but is guilty of an eternal sin”—

## Mark 3:30

because they were saying, “He has an unclean spirit.”

---

## Mark 3:31

Then His mother and His brothers _came_, and while standing outside they sent word to Him, calling for Him.

## Mark 3:32

And a crowd was sitting around Him, and they _said to Him_,  
“Behold, Your mother and Your brothers are outside looking for You.”

## Mark 3:33

And He _answered them and said_,  
“Who are My mother and My brothers?”

## Mark 3:34

And looking around at those who were sitting around Him, He _said_,  
“Here are My mother and My brothers!

## Mark 3:35

For whoever does the will of God, this is My brother, and sister, and mother.”
