# Mark Chapter 14

## Mark 14:1

Now the Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread were approaching, and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were plotting to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him;

## Mark 14:2

“Not during the festival,” they said, “otherwise the people may riot.”

---

## Mark 14:3

While Jesus was in Bethany, reclining at the table in the house of Simon the Leper, a woman came with an alabaster jar of very costly perfume, made of pure nard. She broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head.

## Mark 14:4

Some of those present were indignant and said to one another, “Why this waste of perfume?

## Mark 14:5

It could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor.” And they scolded her harshly.

## Mark 14:6

But Jesus said, “Let her be. Why are you troubling her? She has done a kind act for me.

## Mark 14:7

You will always have the poor with you, and you can help them whenever you wish. But you will not always have me.

## Mark 14:8

She has done what she could; she has anointed my body in preparation for burial.

## Mark 14:9

Truly I say to you, wherever the gospel is proclaimed throughout the world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.”

---

## Mark 14:10

Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests to hand Jesus over to them.

## Mark 14:11

They were pleased to hear this and promised to give him money. So he began seeking an opportunity to hand him over.

---

## Mark 14:12

On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, when it was customary to sacrifice the Passover lamb, Jesus’ disciples asked him, “Where do you want us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?”

## Mark 14:13

So he instructed two of his disciples, saying to them, “Go into the city, and you will meet a man carrying a jar of water; follow him.

## Mark 14:14

Say to the owner of the house he enters, ‘The Teacher asks: Where is my guest room, where I may share the Passover meal with my disciples?’

## Mark 14:15

He will show you a large upper room, furnished and ready. Prepare for us there.”

## Mark 14:16

The disciples left, went into the city and found everything just as Jesus had told them. So they prepared the Passover meal.

---

## Mark 14:17

When evening came, Jesus arrived with the group of twelve.

## Mark 14:18

While they were reclining at the table eating, Jesus said, “Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me—one who is eating with me.”

## Mark 14:19

They were saddened, and one by one they said to him, “Surely it is not I?”

## Mark 14:20

“It is one of the Twelve,” he replied, “one who shares the bowl with me.

## Mark 14:21

The Son of Man will go just as it is written about him. But woe to that man who betrays the Son of Man! It would have been better for him if he had not been born.”

---

## Mark 14:22

While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, “Take it; this symbolises my body.”

## Mark 14:23

Then he took a cup, and after giving thanks, he offered it to them, and they all drank from it.

## Mark 14:24

“This represents my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many,” he said to them.

## Mark 14:25

“Truly I tell you, I will not partake of the fruit of the vine again until that day when I drink it anew in the kingdom of God.”

## Mark 14:26

After they sang a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.

---

## Mark 14:27

“You will all fall away,” Jesus told them, “for it is written:

> ‘I will strike the shepherd,
> and the sheep will be scattered.’

## Mark 14:28

But after I have risen, I shall go before you into Galilee.”

## Mark 14:29

Peter declared, “Even if everyone else falls away, I will not.”

## Mark 14:30

“Truly I tell you,” Jesus answered, “today—yes, tonight—before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.”

## Mark 14:31

But Peter insisted emphatically, “Even if I must die with you, I will never disown you.” And all the others said the same.

---

## Mark 14:32

They arrived at a place called Gethsemane, and Jesus instructed his disciples, “Sit here while I pray.”

## Mark 14:33

He took Peter, James, and John with him, and he began to feel deeply distressed and troubled.

## Mark 14:34

“My soul is deeply grieved, even to the point of death,” he said to them. “Stay here and keep watch.”

## Mark 14:35

Going on a little further, he fell to the ground and prayed, so that if possible, the hour might pass from him.

## Mark 14:36

“Abba, Father,” he said, “all things are possible for you. Remove this cup from me. Yet not what I desire, but what you desire.”

## Mark 14:37

Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. “Simon,” he said to Peter, “are you asleep? Could you not keep watch for one hour?

## Mark 14:38

Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak.”

## Mark 14:39

Once more he went away and prayed in the same manner.

## Mark 14:40

When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy. They were at a loss for words.

## Mark 14:41

Returning the third time, he said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Enough! The hour has come. Look, the Son of Man is handed over to sinners.

## Mark 14:42

Arise! Let us go! Here comes my betrayer!”

---

## Mark 14:43

Just as he was speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, appeared. With him was a crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders.

## Mark 14:44

The betrayer had arranged a signal with them: “The one I kiss is the man; arrest him and lead him away under guard.”

## Mark 14:45

Going directly to Jesus, Judas said, “Rabbi!” and kissed him.

## Mark 14:46

The men seized Jesus and took him into custody.

## Mark 14:47

Then one of those standing near drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, injuring his ear.

## Mark 14:48

“Am I leading a revolt,” said Jesus, “that you have come out with swords and clubs to arrest me?

## Mark 14:49

When I was with you every day, teaching in the temple courts, you did not arrest me. Yet the Scriptures must be fulfilled.”

## Mark 14:50

At that moment, all his followers left him and fled.

---

## Mark 14:51

A young man, wearing only a linen garment, was following Jesus. When they seized him,

## Mark 14:52

he fled without his garment, leaving it behind.

---

## Mark 14:53

They took Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests, the elders, and the teachers of the law gathered together.

## Mark 14:54

Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. There he sat with the guards and warmed himself by the fire.

---

## Mark 14:55

The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were seeking evidence against Jesus to put him to death, but they did not find any.

## Mark 14:56

Many bore false witness against him, but their testimonies did not align.

## Mark 14:57

Then some stood up and presented this false testimony against him:

## Mark 14:58

“We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this temple made with human hands and in three days will build another, that will not made with human hands.’”

## Mark 14:59

Yet even then their testimonies could not agree.

## Mark 14:60

Then the high priest stood up to interrogate Jesus, “Are you not going to respond? What of this testimony these men are bringing against you?”

## Mark 14:61

But Jesus remained silent and did not reply. Again the high priest asked him, “Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?”

## Mark 14:62

“I am,” said Jesus. “And you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.”

## Mark 14:63

At this, the high priest tore his garments. “Why do we need any more witnesses?” he asked.

## Mark 14:64

“You have heard the blasphemy. What is your decision?” They all condemned him as deserving of death.

## Mark 14:65

Then some among them spat at him; then they blindfolded him, struck him with their fists, and said, “Prophesy!” And the guards took him and beat him.

---

## Mark 14:66

While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the high priest's servant girls came by.

## Mark 14:67

When she saw Peter warming himself by the fire, she stared at him. “You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus,” she said.

## Mark 14:68

But he denied it. “I neither know nor understand what you are talking about,” he said, and went out into the entryway.

## Mark 14:69

When the servant girl saw him there, she said again to those standing around, “This man is one of them.”

## Mark 14:70

Again Peter denied it. Only a little while later, those standing amongst him said to him, “Surely you are one of them, for you are a Galilean.”

## Mark 14:71

He began to call down curses, and he swore to them, “I do not know this man you are talking about.”

## Mark 14:72

Immediately the rooster crowed the second time. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken to him: “Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.” And he broke down and wept.
