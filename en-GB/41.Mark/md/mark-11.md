# Mark Chapter 11

## Mark 11:1

As they approached Jerusalem, at Bethphage and Bethany near the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples,

## Mark 11:2

and said to them, “Go into the village ahead of you, and as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden; untie it and bring it here.

## Mark 11:3

If anyone questions you about this, say, ‘The Lord needs it and will return it soon.’”

## Mark 11:4

They went and found a colt tied at a doorway, outside in the street; and they untied it.

## Mark 11:5

Some bystanders said to them, “What are you doing, untying the colt?”

## Mark 11:6

They answered them just as Jesus had instructed, and the people allowed them to go.

## Mark 11:7

They brought the colt to Jesus and placed their cloaks on it, and he sat on it.

## Mark 11:8

Many spread their cloaks on the road, while others spread leafy branches they had cut from the fields.

## Mark 11:9

Those who went ahead and those who followed were shouting,

> “Hosanna!
> Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!”

## Mark 11:10

> “Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David!
> Hosanna in the highest!”

## Mark 11:11

Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple courts. After looking around at everything, he went out to Bethany with the Twelve, as it was already late.

## Mark 11:12

The following day, as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus felt hungry.

## Mark 11:13

Seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to see if he might find anything on it. When he reached it, he found nothing but leaves, as it was not the season for figs.

## Mark 11:14

He said to the tree, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again.” And his disciples heard him say it.

## Mark 11:15

Upon arriving in Jerusalem, Jesus entered the temple courts and began to drive out those who were buying and selling. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves,

## Mark 11:16

and he did not allow anyone to carry goods through the temple courts.

## Mark 11:17

As he taught them, he said, “Is it not written: ‘My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations’? But you have made it a den of robbers.”

## Mark 11:18

The chief priests and the teachers of the law heard this and began seeking a way to eliminate him, for they feared him, because the whole crowd was amazed at his teaching.

## Mark 11:19

When evening arrived, they left the city.

## Mark 11:20

In the morning, as they went along, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots up.

## Mark 11:21

Peter remembered and said to Jesus, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree you spoke against has withered!”

## Mark 11:22

“Have faith in God,” Jesus answered.

## Mark 11:23

“Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,’ and does not doubt in their heart but believes that what they say will happen, it will be done for them.

## Mark 11:24

Therefore I tell you, whatever you request in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.

## Mark 11:25

And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive them, so that your Father in heaven may also forgive your sins.”

## Mark 11:26

[But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father in heaven forgive your sins.”]

## Mark 11:27

They came again to Jerusalem, and as Jesus was walking in the temple courts, the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders came to him,

## Mark 11:28

and asked, “By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?”

## Mark 11:29

Jesus replied, “I will ask you one question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.

## Mark 11:30

Was John's baptism from heaven, or of human origin? Tell me!”

## Mark 11:31

They discussed it among themselves and said, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask, ‘Then why didn’t you believe him?’

## Mark 11:32

But if we say, ‘Of human origin’…” They were afraid of the people, for everyone was convinced that John truly was a prophet.

## Mark 11:33

So they answered Jesus, “We don’t know.” And Jesus said, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”
