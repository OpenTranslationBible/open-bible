# Mark Chapter 11

## Mark 11:1

When they _approached_ Jerusalem, at Bethphage and Bethany, near the Mount of Olives,  
He _sent_ two of His disciples,

## Mark 11:2

and _said to them_,  
“Go into the village opposite you, and immediately as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there,  
on which no one has ever sat; untie it and bring it here.

## Mark 11:3

And if anyone says to you, ‘Why are you doing this?’  
say, ‘The Lord has need of it,’ and immediately he will send it back here.”

## Mark 11:4

And they went away and found a colt tied at the door, outside in the street; and they untied it.

## Mark 11:5

And some of the bystanders were saying to them,  
“What are you doing, untying the colt?”

## Mark 11:6

And they told them just as Jesus had said, and they gave them permission.

## Mark 11:7

They _brought_ the colt to Jesus and _put_ their cloaks on it; and He sat on it.

## Mark 11:8

And many people spread their cloaks on the road,  
and others spread leafy branches which they had cut from the fields.

## Mark 11:9

And those who went in front and those who followed were shouting:

> “Hosanna!  
> Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord;

## Mark 11:10

> Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David;  
> Hosanna in the highest!”

## Mark 11:11

And Jesus entered Jerusalem and came into the temple area;  
and after looking around at everything, He left for Bethany with the twelve, since it was already late.

## Mark 11:12

On the next day, when they had left Bethany, He became hungry.

## Mark 11:13

Seeing from a distance a fig tree in leaf, He went to see if perhaps He would find anything on it;  
and when He came to it, He found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.

## Mark 11:14

And He said to it,  
“May no one ever eat fruit from you again!”  
And His disciples were listening.

---

## Mark 11:15

Then they _came_ to Jerusalem.  
And He entered the temple area and began to drive out those who were selling and buying on the temple grounds,  
and He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were selling doves;

## Mark 11:16

and He would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple grounds.

## Mark 11:17

And He began to teach and say to them,  
“Is it not written:  
‘My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations’?  
But you have made it a den of robbers.”

## Mark 11:18

And the chief priests and the scribes heard this,  
and they began seeking how to put Him to death;  
for they were afraid of Him, because all the crowd was astonished at His teaching.

## Mark 11:19

And whenever evening came, they would leave the city.

---

## Mark 11:20

As they were passing by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots up.

## Mark 11:21

And Peter remembered and _said to Him_,  
“Rabbi, look, the fig tree that You cursed has withered.”

## Mark 11:22

And Jesus _answered and said to them_,  
“Have faith in God.

## Mark 11:23

Truly I say to you, whoever says to this mountain,  
‘Be taken up and thrown into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart,  
but believes that what he says is going to happen, it will be done for him.

## Mark 11:24

Therefore I say to you, all things for which you pray and ask,  
believe that you have received them, and they will be yours.

## Mark 11:25

And whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone,  
so that your Father who is in heaven will also forgive you your offenses.

## Mark 11:26

[But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your offenses.”]

---

## Mark 11:27

And they _came again_ to Jerusalem.  
And as He was walking in the temple area, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders _came to Him_,

## Mark 11:28

and began saying to Him,  
“By what authority are You doing these things, or who gave You this authority to do these things?”

## Mark 11:29

But Jesus said to them,  
“I will ask you one question, and you answer Me,  
and then I will tell you by what authority I do these things.

## Mark 11:30

Was the baptism of John from heaven, or from men? Answer Me.”

## Mark 11:31

They began reasoning among themselves, saying,  
“If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will say, ‘Then why did you not believe him?’

## Mark 11:32

But shall we say, ‘From men’?”—they were afraid of the people,  
for they all considered John to have been a real prophet.

## Mark 11:33

Answering Jesus, they _said_, “We do not know.”  
And Jesus _said to them_,  
“Neither am I telling you by what authority I do these things.”
