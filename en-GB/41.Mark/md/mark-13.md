# Mark Chapter 13

## Mark 13:1

As Jesus was departing from the temple, one of His disciples remarked to Him, “Teacher, behold the impressive stones and splendid buildings!”

## Mark 13:2

Jesus responded, “Do you observe these magnificent buildings? Not a single stone will remain upon another; every one will be demolished.”

## Mark 13:3

While He was seated on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew inquired of Him privately,

## Mark 13:4

“Tell us, when will these events occur, and what will be the sign that all these things are about to be accomplished?”

## Mark 13:5

Jesus began to say to them, “Ensure that no one leads you astray.

## Mark 13:6

Many will come in My name, asserting, ‘I am He,’ and will deceive many.

## Mark 13:7

When you hear of wars and rumours of wars, do not be disturbed; such things must transpire, but the end is not yet.

## Mark 13:8

For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places, and famines. These are merely the beginning of birth pains.

---

## Mark 13:9

“Be on your guard; you will be delivered to local councils and flogged in synagogues. You will stand before governors and kings for My sake, as a testimony to them.

## Mark 13:10

And the good news must first reach all nations.

## Mark 13:11

When they arrest you and hand you over, do not fret beforehand about what to speak; speak whatever is given to you at that moment, for it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.

## Mark 13:12

Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child. Children will rise against parents and cause them to be put to death.

## Mark 13:13

You will be hated by all because of My name, but the one who endures to the end will be saved.

---

## Mark 13:14

“When you see ‘the abomination that causes desolation’ standing where it ought not—let the reader understand—then let those in Judea flee to the mountains.

## Mark 13:15

Let no one on the housetop descend or enter the house to retrieve anything.

## Mark 13:16

Let no one in the field return to fetch their cloak.

## Mark 13:17

How dreadful it will be for those who are pregnant and nursing infants in those days!

## Mark 13:18

Pray that it does not occur in winter,

## Mark 13:19

for those will be days of tribulation unmatched from the beginning of creation, which God created, until now, and never to be equalled again.

## Mark 13:20

If the Lord had not curtailed those days, no life would be saved; but for the sake of the elect, whom He has chosen, He has shortened them.

---

## Mark 13:21

If anyone tells you during that time, ‘Look, here is the Messiah!’ or, ‘Look, there He is!’ do not believe it.

## Mark 13:22

For false messiahs and false prophets will arise and perform signs and wonders to mislead, if possible, even the elect.

## Mark 13:23

So be vigilant; I have forewarned you of everything.

---

## Mark 13:24

“But in those days, following that tribulation,

> the sun will be darkened,
> and the moon will not shed its light;

## Mark 13:25

> the stars will fall from the sky,
> and the celestial powers will be shaken.

## Mark 13:26

Then they will witness the Son of Man arriving in clouds with great power and glory.

## Mark 13:27

And He will send His angels to gather His elect from the four winds, from the extremities of the earth to the extremities of heaven.

---

## Mark 13:28

“Learn this lesson from the fig tree: as soon as its branches become tender and sprout leaves, you know that summer is near.

## Mark 13:29

In the same way, when you see these things happening, recognise that it is near, right at the door.

## Mark 13:30

Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have occurred.

## Mark 13:31

Though heaven and earth may pass away, My words will never pass away.

---

## Mark 13:32

But concerning that day or hour, no one knows—neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.

## Mark 13:33

Be vigilant! Stay alert! For you do not know when that time will come.

## Mark 13:34

It is like a man going on a journey, who leaves his house and puts his servants in charge, each with their task, and instructs the doorkeeper to keep watch.

## Mark 13:35

Therefore, keep watch, for you do not know when the master of the house will return—whether in the evening, at midnight, when the rooster crows, or at dawn.

## Mark 13:36

If he arrives suddenly, do not let him find you sleeping.

## Mark 13:37

What I say to you, I say to everyone: ‘Stay alert!’”
