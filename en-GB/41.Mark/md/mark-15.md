The crowd approached and asked Pilate to do as he usually did for them.

## Mark 15:9

Pilate asked them, “Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?”

## Mark 15:10

He knew it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed Jesus over.

## Mark 15:11

But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have Pilate release Barabbas instead.

## Mark 15:12

Pilate asked them again, “What shall I do with the one you call the King of the Jews?”

## Mark 15:13

## Mark 15:14

Pilate questioned, “Why, what crime has He committed?” But they shouted even louder, “Crucify Him!”

## Mark 15:15

To satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. After having Jesus flogged, he handed Him over to be crucified.

Those passing by hurled insults at Him, shaking their heads and saying, “Ah! You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days,

## Mark 15:30

save Yourself by coming down from the cross!”

## Mark 15:31

Similarly, the chief priests and scribes mocked Him among themselves, saying, “He saved others, but He cannot save Himself!

## Mark 15:32

Let this Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe.” Those crucified with Him also insulted Him.

## Mark 15:35

Some of the bystanders heard Him and said, “Listen, He is calling for Elijah.”

## Mark 15:36

Someone ran, filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a reed, and offered it to Him to drink, saying, “Let us see if Elijah comes to take Him down.”

With a loud cry, Jesus breathed His last.

Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the Council, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, gathered courage and went to Pilate to ask for Jesus’ body.
