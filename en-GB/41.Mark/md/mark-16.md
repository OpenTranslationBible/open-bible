# Mark Chapter 16

## Mark 16:1

When the Sabbath had ended, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome purchased spices to go and anoint Him.

## Mark 16:2

Very early on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb just after the sun had risen.

## Mark 16:3

They were discussing among themselves, “Who will roll away the stone from the tomb’s entrance for us?”

## Mark 16:4

Upon looking up, they observed that the stone, which was exceedingly large, had already been rolled away.

## Mark 16:5

Entering the tomb, they saw a young man clothed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were astonished.

## Mark 16:6

He said to them, “Do not be astonished. You seek Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen; He is not here. Look at the place where they laid Him.

## Mark 16:7

But go, tell His disciples and Peter, ‘He is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will meet Him, just as He told you.’”

## Mark 16:8

They went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and amazement had seized them; and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.

After this, He appeared in a different form to two of them as they were walking in the countryside.

## Mark 16:14

Later, He appeared to the eleven disciples as they were reclining at the table; He rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen Him after He had risen.

## Mark 16:15

And He said to them, “Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to all creation.

## Mark 16:16

Those who believe and are baptised will be saved, but those who do not believe will face judgment.

## Mark 16:17

These signs will accompany those who believe: in My name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues;

## Mark 16:18

they will handle serpents, and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not harm them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover.”

## Mark 16:19

After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, He was taken up into heaven and sat at the right hand of God.

And they went out and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the word by the signs that followed. [[They promptly reported all these instructions to Peter and his companions. After that, Jesus Himself sent out through them from east to west the sacred and imperishable proclamation of eternal salvation.]]
