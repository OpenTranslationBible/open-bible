# Mark Chapter 8

## Mark 8:1

In those days, when there was once more a large crowd and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called His disciples to Him and said,

## Mark 8:2

“I have compassion for these people, because they have been with Me for three days now and have nothing to eat.

## Mark 8:3

If I send them away hungry to their homes, they will faint on the way, for some of them have come from a long distance.”

## Mark 8:4

His disciples answered Him, “Where can anyone find enough bread here in this desolate place to feed them?”

## Mark 8:5

He asked them, “How many loaves do you have?” They said, “Seven.”

## Mark 8:6

He directed the crowd to sit down on the ground. Taking the seven loaves, He gave thanks, broke them, and gave them to His disciples to distribute to the people, and they did so.

## Mark 8:7

They also had a few small fish; He blessed them and instructed the disciples to distribute these as well.

## Mark 8:8

The people ate and were satisfied, and they picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.

## Mark 8:9

There were about four thousand people present. After dismissing them,

## Mark 8:10

He got into the boat with His disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha.

---

## Mark 8:11

The Pharisees came and began to argue with Him, asking Him for a sign from heaven, to test Him.

## Mark 8:12

Sighing deeply in His spirit, He said, “Why does this generation ask for a sign? Truly I tell you, no sign will be given to it.”

## Mark 8:13

Then He left them, got back into the boat and crossed to the other side.

---

## Mark 8:14

The disciples had forgotten to take bread, except for one loaf they had with them in the boat.

## Mark 8:15

He cautioned them, saying, “Watch out for the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.”

## Mark 8:16

They discussed this with one another and said, “It is because we have no bread.”

## Mark 8:17

Aware of their discussion, Jesus said to them, “Why are you talking about having no bread? Do you still not understand or comprehend? Are your hearts hardened?

## Mark 8:18

Do you have eyes but fail to see, and ears but fail to hear? And do you not remember?

## Mark 8:19

When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you pick up?” They said, “Twelve.”

## Mark 8:20

“And when I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you pick up?” They replied, “Seven.”

## Mark 8:21

He said to them, “Do you still not understand?”

---

## Mark 8:22

They came to Bethsaida, and some people brought a blind man to Jesus and begged Him to touch him.

## Mark 8:23

He took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village. After spitting on the man's eyes and laying His hands on him, He asked, “Do you see anything?”

## Mark 8:24

He looked up and said, “I see people; they look like trees walking around.”

## Mark 8:25

Once more Jesus put His hands on the man's eyes. Then his eyes were opened, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly.

## Mark 8:26

Jesus sent him home, saying, “Do not even enter the village.”

---

## Mark 8:27

Jesus went out with His disciples to the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way, He asked them, “Who do people say I am?”

## Mark 8:28

They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, one of the prophets.”

## Mark 8:29

“But what about you?” He asked. “Who do you say I am?” Peter answered, “You are the Christ.”

## Mark 8:30

He warned them not to tell anyone about Him.

---

## Mark 8:31

He then began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.

## Mark 8:32

He spoke plainly about this, and Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him.

## Mark 8:33

But turning and seeing His disciples, He rebuked Peter and said, “Get behind Me, Satan! You do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns.”

---

## Mark 8:34

Then He called the crowd to Him along with His disciples and said, “If anyone wants to be My disciple, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow Me.

## Mark 8:35

For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake and for the gospel will save it.

## Mark 8:36

What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?

## Mark 8:37

Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?

## Mark 8:38

If anyone is ashamed of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when He comes in His Father’s glory with the holy angels.”
