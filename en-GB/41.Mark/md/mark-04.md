# Mark Chapter 4

## Mark 4:1

Once more, Jesus began to teach by the sea. A very large crowd gathered around Him, so He got into a boat on the sea and sat down, while the entire crowd was on the shore by the water's edge.

## Mark 4:2

He taught them many things using parables, and in His teaching, He said to them:

## Mark 4:3

“Listen! A sower went out to sow his seed.

## Mark 4:4

As he was sowing, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it.

## Mark 4:5

Other seed fell on rocky ground where there was not much soil, and it sprang up quickly because the soil was shallow.

## Mark 4:6

But when the sun rose, it was scorched, and since it had no root, it withered away.

## Mark 4:7

Other seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, so it yielded no crop.

## Mark 4:8

Still other seed fell on good soil. It grew, increased, and produced a crop, yielding thirty, sixty, and a hundredfold.”

## Mark 4:9

Then He said, “Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.”

## Mark 4:10

When He was alone, those around Him, along with the Twelve, asked Him about the parables.

## Mark 4:11

He said to them, “The mystery of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to those outside, everything is said in parables,

## Mark 4:12

so that,

> ‘they may see but not perceive,
> and hear but not understand;
> otherwise they might turn and be forgiven.’”

---

## Mark 4:13

Then He said to them, “Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand any parable?

## Mark 4:14

The sower sows the word.

## Mark 4:15

Some people are like seed along the path where the word is sown. As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.

## Mark 4:16

Others, like seed sown on rocky places, hear the word and immediately receive it with joy;

## Mark 4:17

but they have no root in themselves and are short-lived. When trouble or persecution arises because of the word, they quickly fall away.

## Mark 4:18

Others are like seed sown among thorns; they hear the word,

## Mark 4:19

but the cares of the world, the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.

## Mark 4:20

But others are like seed sown on good soil; they hear the word, accept it, and bear fruit—thirty, sixty, and a hundredfold.”

---

## Mark 4:21

He said to them, “Is a lamp brought in to be put under a basket or under a bed? Is it not to be placed on a lampstand?

## Mark 4:22

For whatever is hidden is meant to be revealed, and whatever is concealed is meant to come to light.

## Mark 4:23

If anyone has ears to hear, let them hear.”

## Mark 4:24

He continued, “Consider carefully what you hear. With the measure you use, it will be measured to you—and even more will be added.

## Mark 4:25

For whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken away.”

---

## Mark 4:26

He also said, “The kingdom of God is like a man scattering seed on the ground.

## Mark 4:27

He sleeps and rises night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how.

## Mark 4:28

The earth produces crops by itself; first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.

## Mark 4:29

But when the crop is ready, he immediately puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.”

---

## Mark 4:30

Again He said, “To what shall we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable shall we use to describe it?

## Mark 4:31

It is like a mustard seed, which, when sown on the ground, is the smallest of all the seeds on earth.

## Mark 4:32

Yet when it is sown, it grows up and becomes larger than all the garden plants, and puts forth large branches, so that the birds of the air can nest in its shade.”

---

## Mark 4:33

With many such parables, He spoke the word to them, as much as they could understand.

## Mark 4:34

He did not speak to them without a parable, but privately He explained everything to His own disciples.

---

## Mark 4:35

On that day, when evening came, He said to His disciples, “Let us cross over to the other side.”

## Mark 4:36

Leaving the crowd behind, they took Him along in the boat, just as He was. Other boats were also with Him.

## Mark 4:37

A great windstorm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was already filling.

## Mark 4:38

But He was in the stern, asleep on a cushion. They woke Him and said to Him, “Teacher, do You not care that we are perishing?”

## Mark 4:39

He got up, rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Peace! Be still!” Then the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.

## Mark 4:40

He said to them, “Why are you so afraid? Do you still have no faith?”

## Mark 4:41

They were filled with great fear and said to one another, “Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey Him?”
