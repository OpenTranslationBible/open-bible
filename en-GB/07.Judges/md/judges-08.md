# Judges Chapter 8

## Judges 8:1

Then the Ephraimites said to Gideon, “What is this action you have taken against us by not calling us when you went to battle against Midian?” And they argued with him intensely.

## Judges 8:2

But he responded, “What have I accomplished compared to you? Is not the gleaning of Ephraim’s grapes better than the full harvest of Abiezer?

## Judges 8:3

God delivered Oreb and Zeeb, the leaders of Midian, into your hands. What was I able to do in comparison to you?” At this, their anger towards him subsided.

## Judges 8:4

Gideon and the three hundred men with him, exhausted yet continuing the pursuit, reached the Jordan and crossed over.

## Judges 8:5

He said to the men of Succoth, “Please give bread to my troops, for they are weary, and I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.”

## Judges 8:6

But the leaders of Succoth replied, “Do you already have Zebah and Zalmunna in your hands, that we should give bread to your army?”

## Judges 8:7

Gideon answered, “For this response, when the Lord has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, I will punish you with the thorns and briers of the desert.”

## Judges 8:8

From there he went up to Penuel and made the same request, but they responded just as the men of Succoth had.

## Judges 8:9

So he said to the men of Penuel, “When I return safely, I will tear down this tower.”

## Judges 8:10

Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with about fifteen thousand men, all that remained of the armies of the eastern peoples; a hundred and twenty thousand swordsmen had fallen.

## Judges 8:11

Gideon went up by the route of the nomads east of Nobah and Jogbehah and attacked the unsuspecting camp.

## Judges 8:12

Zebah and Zalmunna fled, but he pursued and captured the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, routing their entire army.

## Judges 8:13

Gideon son of Joash then returned from the battle by the ascent of Heres.

## Judges 8:14

He captured a young man from Succoth and questioned him, and the youth wrote down for him the names of the seventy-seven officials and elders of Succoth.

## Judges 8:15

Then Gideon came to the men of Succoth and said, “Here are Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you taunted me, saying, ‘Do you already have Zebah and Zalmunna in your hands, that we should give bread to your weary men?’”

## Judges 8:16

He took the elders of the town and disciplined the men of Succoth with desert thorns and briers.

## Judges 8:17

He also tore down the tower of Penuel and killed the men of the city.

## Judges 8:18

Then he asked Zebah and Zalmunna, “What kind of men did you kill at Tabor?” They replied, “Men like you, each one with the bearing of a prince.”

## Judges 8:19

Gideon said, “Those were my brothers, the sons of my own mother. As surely as the Lord lives, if you had spared their lives, I would not kill you.”

## Judges 8:20

Turning to Jether, his firstborn, he said, “Rise and kill them.” But the boy did not draw his sword, because he was afraid, being still a youth.

## Judges 8:21

Zebah and Zalmunna said, “Rise yourself and strike us; for as the man is, so is his strength.” So Gideon stepped forward and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the ornaments from their camels’ necks.

## Judges 8:22

The Israelites said to Gideon, “Rule over us—you, your son, and your grandson—because you have saved us from the hand of Midian.”

## Judges 8:23

But Gideon replied, “I will not rule over you, nor will my son rule over you. The Lord will rule over you.”

## Judges 8:24

Gideon said, “I do have one request, that each of you give me an earring from your share of the plunder.” (It was the custom of the Ishmaelites to wear gold earrings.)

## Judges 8:25

They answered, “We will gladly give them.” So they spread out a garment, and each man threw an earring from his plunder onto it.

## Judges 8:26

The weight of the gold earrings he requested was seventeen hundred shekels, not counting the ornaments, pendants, and the purple garments worn by the kings of Midian, or the chains on their camels’ necks.

## Judges 8:27

Gideon made the gold into an ephod, which he placed in Ophrah, his town. All Israel prostituted themselves by worshipping it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and his family.

---

## Judges 8:28

Thus Midian was subdued before the Israelites and did not raise its head again. During Gideon’s lifetime, the land had peace for forty years.

## Judges 8:29

Jerub-Baal son of Joash went back to live in his own house.

## Judges 8:30

He had seventy sons of his own, for he had many wives.

## Judges 8:31

His concubine, who lived in Shechem, also bore him a son, whom he named Abimelech.

## Judges 8:32

Gideon son of Joash died at a good old age and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.

## Judges 8:33

As soon as Gideon died, the Israelites again prostituted themselves to the Baals and set up Baal-Berith as their god.

## Judges 8:34

They did not remember the Lord their God, who had rescued them from the hands of all their enemies on every side.

## Judges 8:35

They also failed to show kindness to the family of Jerub-Baal (that is, Gideon) despite all the good things he had done for Israel.
