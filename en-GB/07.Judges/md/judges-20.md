# Judges Chapter 20

## Judges 20:1

Then all the Israelites from Dan to Beersheba, including the land of Gilead, gathered together as one assembly before the Lord at Mizpah.

## Judges 20:2

The leaders of all the tribes of Israel took their places in the assembly of God's people, comprising four hundred thousand foot soldiers armed with swords.

## Judges 20:3

(The Benjamites heard that the Israelites had assembled at Mizpah.) The Israelites asked, “Explain to us how this wickedness occurred.”

## Judges 20:4

The Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, answered, “My concubine and I came to Gibeah in Benjamin to spend the night.

## Judges 20:5

The men of Gibeah rose against me and surrounded the house by night, intending to kill me. They raped my concubine, and she died.

## Judges 20:6

I took my concubine, cut her into pieces, and sent them throughout Israel's territory, for they committed a disgraceful and vile act in Israel.

## Judges 20:7

Now, all you Israelites, give your verdict and advice here.”

## Judges 20:8

All the people rose as one, saying, “None of us will return to our tents or homes.

## Judges 20:9

This is what we will do to Gibeah: we will draw lots to decide how we attack it.

## Judges 20:10

We will take ten men out of every hundred from all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred out of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to supply provisions for the army. When the army arrives at Gibeah in Benjamin, they will punish them for the vile act committed in Israel.”

## Judges 20:11

So all the men of Israel united as one against the city.

## Judges 20:12

The tribes of Israel sent messengers throughout the tribe of Benjamin, saying, “What is this wickedness that has occurred among you?

## Judges 20:13

Now hand over those wicked men of Gibeah so that we may put them to death and purge the evil from Israel.” But the Benjamites refused to listen to their fellow Israelites.

## Judges 20:14

Instead, the Benjamites gathered from their towns to Gibeah to fight against the Israelites.

## Judges 20:15

That day, the Benjamites mobilised twenty-six thousand swordsmen from their towns, excluding seven hundred chosen men from Gibeah.

## Judges 20:16

Among all these soldiers were seven hundred select troops, left-handed, each capable of slinging a stone at a hair without missing.

## Judges 20:17

The Israelites, excluding Benjamin, mustered four hundred thousand swordsmen, all prepared for battle.

## Judges 20:18

The Israelites went up to Bethel and inquired of God, “Who shall go first to battle against the Benjamites?” The Lord answered, “Judah shall go first.”

## Judges 20:19

The next morning, the Israelites rose and camped near Gibeah.

## Judges 20:20

The Israelites advanced to fight the Benjamites and took up battle positions against them at Gibeah.

## Judges 20:21

The Benjamites emerged from Gibeah and struck down twenty-two thousand Israelites on the battlefield that day.

## Judges 20:22

But the Israelites encouraged each other and took up their positions again as they had on the first day.

## Judges 20:23

The Israelites went up and wept before the Lord until evening, and inquired of the Lord, “Shall we go up again to fight against the Benjamites, our brothers?” The Lord answered, “Go up against them.”

## Judges 20:24

The Israelites approached the Benjamites on the second day.

## Judges 20:25

This time, the Benjamites came out from Gibeah and killed another eighteen thousand Israelites, all armed with swords.

## Judges 20:26

Then all the Israelites, the entire army, went up to Bethel, where they sat weeping before the Lord. They fasted that day until evening and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings to the Lord.

## Judges 20:27

The Israelites inquired of the Lord. (In those days, the ark of the covenant of God was there,

## Judges 20:28

with Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, ministering before it.) They asked, “Shall we go up again to fight against the Benjamites, our brothers, or should we cease?” The Lord replied, “Go, for tomorrow I will deliver them into your hands.”

## Judges 20:29

Then Israel set men in ambush around Gibeah.

## Judges 20:30

On the third day, the Israelites went up against the Benjamites and took up positions against Gibeah as before.

## Judges 20:31

The Benjamites came out to meet them and were drawn away from the city. They began to inflict casualties on the Israelites as on previous occasions, about thirty men fell in the open field and on the roads—one leading to Bethel and the other to Gibeah.

## Judges 20:32

The Benjamites thought, “We are defeating them as before,” but the Israelites said, “Let us retreat and draw them away from the city to the roads.”

## Judges 20:33

All the men of Israel moved from their positions and took up positions at Baal Tamar, and the Israelite ambush charged out from Maareh-geba.

## Judges 20:34

Ten thousand of Israel's chosen men launched a frontal attack on Gibeah. The battle was intense, and the Benjamites did not realise disaster was near.

## Judges 20:35

The Lord defeated Benjamin before Israel, and the Israelites struck down 25,100 Benjamites that day, all armed with swords.

## Judges 20:36

The Benjamites saw they were defeated. The men of Israel had given way before Benjamin because they relied on the ambush they had set near Gibeah.

## Judges 20:37

Those in ambush rushed into Gibeah, spread out, and put the entire city to the sword.

## Judges 20:38

The Israelites had arranged with the ambush that they would send up a great cloud of smoke from the city,

## Judges 20:39

and then the Israelites would counterattack. The Benjamites had begun to inflict casualties on the Israelites (about thirty), and they said, “We are defeating them as in the first battle.”

## Judges 20:40

But when the column of smoke began to rise from the city, the Benjamites turned and saw the entire city going up in smoke.

## Judges 20:41

Then the Israelites turned on them, and the Benjamites were terrified because they realised disaster had come upon them.

## Judges 20:42

They fled before the Israelites toward the wilderness, but they could not escape the battle. The Israelites who came out of the towns cut them down there.

## Judges 20:43

They surrounded the Benjamites, pursued them, and easily overran them in the vicinity of Gibeah on the east.

## Judges 20:44

Eighteen thousand Benjamites fell, all of them valiant fighters.

## Judges 20:45

As they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, the Israelites caught five thousand of them on the roads and overtook them at Gidom, striking down two thousand more.

## Judges 20:46

On that day, twenty-five thousand Benjamite swordsmen fell, all of them valiant fighters.

## Judges 20:47

But six hundred men turned and fled into the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, where they stayed for four months.

## Judges 20:48

The men of Israel went back to Benjamin and put all the towns to the sword, including the animals and everything else they found. They set on fire all the towns they came across.
