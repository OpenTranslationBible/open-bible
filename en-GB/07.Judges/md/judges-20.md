# Judges Chapter 20

## Judges 20:1

Then all Israel from Dan to Beersheba and from the land of Gilead came together as one and assembled before the Lord in Mizpah.

## Judges 20:2

The leaders of all the people of the tribes of Israel took their places in the assembly of God’s people —  
four hundred thousand men armed with swords.

## Judges 20:3

(The Benjamites heard that the Israelites had gone up to Mizpah.)  
Then the Israelites said, “Tell us how this awful thing happened.”

## Judges 20:4

So the Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, said,  
“I came to Gibeah in Benjamin with my concubine to spend the night.

## Judges 20:5

During the night the men of Gibeah came after me and surrounded the house, intending to kill me.  
They abused my concubine until she died.

## Judges 20:6

I took my concubine, cut her into pieces and sent her throughout the territory of Israel’s inheritance,  
because they committed an outrageous act in Israel.

## Judges 20:7

Now, all you Israelites, speak up and give your verdict here and now.”

## Judges 20:8

All the people rose together as one, saying,  
“None of us will go home. No one will return to their house.

## Judges 20:9

This is what we’ll do to Gibeah: We’ll draw lots

## Judges 20:10

and take ten men out of every hundred from all the tribes of Israel,  
and a hundred out of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to get supplies for the army.  
When the army arrives at Gibeah in Benjamin, they will repay them for the outrageous thing done in Israel.”

## Judges 20:11

So all the Israelites gathered together and united as one against the city.

---

## Judges 20:12

The tribes of Israel sent messengers throughout the tribe of Benjamin, saying,  
“What about this evil act that was committed among you?

## Judges 20:13

Now turn over those wicked men of Gibeah so that we may put them to death and purge the evil from Israel.”  
But the Benjamites would not listen to their fellow Israelites.

## Judges 20:14

From their towns they came together at Gibeah to fight against the Israelites.

## Judges 20:15

At once the Benjamites mobilised twenty-six thousand swordsmen from their towns,  
in addition to seven hundred chosen men from Gibeah.

## Judges 20:16

Among all these were seven hundred select troops who were left-handed,  
each of whom could sling a stone at a hair and not miss.

## Judges 20:17

Israel, apart from Benjamin, mustered four hundred thousand swordsmen,  
all of them experienced in battle.

---

## Judges 20:18

The Israelites went up to Bethel and inquired of God.  
They said, “Who of us is to go up first to fight against the Benjamites?”  
The Lord replied, “Judah shall go first.”

## Judges 20:19

The next morning the Israelites set out and camped near Gibeah.

## Judges 20:20

The Israelites went out to fight the Benjamites and took up battle positions against them at Gibeah.

## Judges 20:21

The Benjamites came out of Gibeah and cut down twenty-two thousand Israelites on the battlefield that day.

---

## Judges 20:22

But the Israelites encouraged one another and again took up their positions where they had stationed themselves the first day.

## Judges 20:23

The Israelites went up and wept before the Lord until evening, and they inquired of the Lord.  
They said, “Shall we go up again to fight against the Benjamites, our fellow Israelites?”  
The Lord answered, “Go up against them.”

## Judges 20:24

Then the Israelites drew near to the Benjamites the second day.

## Judges 20:25

This time, when the Benjamites came out from Gibeah to oppose them,  
they cut down another eighteen thousand Israelites, all of them armed with swords.

## Judges 20:26

Then all the Israelites, the whole army, went up to Bethel, and there they sat weeping before the Lord.  
They fasted that day until evening and presented burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to the Lord.

## Judges 20:27

And the Israelites inquired of the Lord.  
(In those days the ark of the covenant of God was there,

## Judges 20:28

with Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, ministering before it.)  
They asked, “Shall we go up again to fight against the Benjamites, our fellow Israelites, or not?”  
The Lord responded, “Go, for tomorrow I will give them into your hands.”

## Judges 20:29

Then Israel set an ambush around Gibeah.

## Judges 20:30

They went up against the Benjamites on the third day and took up positions against Gibeah as they had done before.

## Judges 20:31

The Benjamites came out to meet them and were drawn away from the city.  
They began to inflict casualties on the Israelites as before, about thirty men,  
saying, “We are defeating them as before!”

## Judges 20:32

But the Israelites said, “Let’s retreat and draw them away from the city onto the roads.”

## Judges 20:33

All the men of Israel moved from their places and took up positions at Baal Tamar,  
and the Israelite ambush charged out of its hiding place west of Gibeah.

## Judges 20:34

Then ten thousand of Israel’s finest warriors attacked Gibeah, and the fighting was intense.  
The Benjamites did not realise that disaster was near.

---

## Judges 20:35

The Lord defeated Benjamin before Israel, and on that day the Israelites struck down twenty-five thousand one hundred Benjamites, all armed with swords.

## Judges 20:36

Then the Benjamites saw that they were beaten.  
Now the men of Israel had given way before Benjamin, because they relied on the ambush they had set near Gibeah.

## Judges 20:37

Those who had been in ambush rushed in and spread out and put the whole city to the sword.

## Judges 20:38

Now the Israelites had agreed on a signal with the ambush: when they saw a great cloud of smoke rising from the city,

## Judges 20:39

the men of Israel would turn in battle.  
The Benjamites had begun to inflict casualties on the Israelites, about thirty men, and they said,  
“We are defeating them as in the first battle!”

## Judges 20:40

But when the column of smoke began to rise from the city,  
the Benjamites turned and saw the whole city going up in smoke.

---

## Judges 20:41

Then the Israelites turned and the Benjamites were terrified,  
because they realised that disaster had come upon them.

## Judges 20:42

So they fled before the Israelites in the direction of the wilderness, but they could not escape the battle.  
And the Israelites who came out of the towns cut them down there.

## Judges 20:43

They surrounded the Benjamites, chased them, and easily overtook them in the vicinity of Gibeah on the east.

## Judges 20:44

Eighteen thousand Benjamite men fell — all of them valiant fighters.

## Judges 20:45

As they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon,  
the Israelites cut down five thousand men along the roads.  
They kept up the pursuit as far as Gidom and struck down two thousand more.

## Judges 20:46

On that day, twenty-five thousand Benjamite swordsmen fell, all of them valiant fighters.

## Judges 20:47

But six hundred men turned and fled into the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon,  
where they stayed four months.

## Judges 20:48

The men of Israel went back to Benjamin and put all the towns to the sword, including the animals and everything else they found.  
All the towns they came to they set on fire.
