# Judges Chapter 13

## Judges 13:1

Once more the Israelites did evil in the sight of the Lord, and He handed them over to the Philistines for forty years.

## Judges 13:2

There was a man from Zorah, of the Danite clan, named Manoah, whose wife was barren and had not given birth.

## Judges 13:3

The angel of the Lord appeared to her and said, “You are barren and childless, but you will conceive and give birth to a son.

## Judges 13:4

Now be careful not to drink wine or any strong drink, and do not eat anything unclean.

## Judges 13:5

For you will conceive and give birth to a son. No razor shall touch his head, for the boy is to be a Nazirite, dedicated to God from the womb. He will begin to deliver Israel from the Philistines.”

## Judges 13:6

The woman went to her husband and said, “A man of God came to me; his appearance was like that of an angel of God, very awe-inspiring. I did not ask where he was from, nor did he tell me his name.

## Judges 13:7

He said to me, ‘You will conceive and give birth to a son. Now, do not drink wine or strong drink, and do not eat anything unclean, for the boy will be a Nazirite to God from the womb until the day of his death.’”

## Judges 13:8

Manoah prayed to the Lord, “Please, Lord, let the man of God you sent come again to teach us how to raise the boy who is to be born.”

## Judges 13:9

God listened to Manoah, and the angel of God came again to the woman as she was in the field, but her husband Manoah was not with her.

## Judges 13:10

The woman hurried to her husband and said, “The man who appeared to me the other day is here!”

## Judges 13:11

## Manoah got up and followed his wife. When he reached the man, he asked, “Are you the man who spoke to my wife?” “I am,” he replied.

## Judges 13:12

Manoah asked, “When your words are fulfilled, what will be the boy’s way of life and his mission?”

## Judges 13:13

The angel of the Lord answered, “Your wife must observe all that I have told her.

## Judges 13:14

She must not consume anything from the vine, nor drink wine or strong drink, nor eat anything unclean. She must do everything I have commanded her.”

## Judges 13:15

Manoah said to the angel of the Lord, “Please stay while we prepare a young goat for you.”

## Judges 13:16

The angel of the Lord replied, “Even if you detain me, I will not eat your food. But if you prepare a burnt offering, offer it to the Lord.” Manoah did not realise it was the angel of the Lord.

## Judges 13:17

Manoah asked the angel of the Lord, “What is your name, so that we may honour you when your word comes true?”

## Judges 13:18

He replied, “Why do you ask my name? It is beyond understanding.”

## Judges 13:19

Manoah took a young goat and a grain offering and offered them on a rock to the Lord. The Lord performed wonders while Manoah and his wife watched.

## Judges 13:20

As the flame rose from the altar towards heaven, the angel of the Lord ascended in the flame. Seeing this, Manoah and his wife fell with their faces to the ground.

## Judges 13:21

When the angel of the Lord did not appear again to Manoah and his wife, Manoah realised it was the angel of the Lord.

## Judges 13:22

Manoah said to his wife, “We shall surely die, for we have seen God!”

## Judges 13:23

But his wife replied, “If the Lord intended to kill us, He would not have accepted a burnt offering and grain offering from our hands, nor shown us all these things or told us this.”

## Judges 13:24

The woman gave birth to a son and named him Samson. He grew, and the Lord blessed him.

## Judges 13:25

The Spirit of the Lord began to stir him while he was in Mahaneh Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.
