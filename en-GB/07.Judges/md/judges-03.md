# Judges Chapter 3

## Judges 3:1

These are the nations that the Lord left to test all the Israelites who had not experienced any of the wars in Canaan.

## Judges 3:2

This was done to teach warfare to the generations of the Israelites who had not previously experienced it.

## Judges 3:3

The nations included the five rulers of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites living in the Lebanon mountains from Mount Baal Hermon to Lebo Hamath.

## Judges 3:4

They were left to test the Israelites to see if they would obey the Lord’s commands, which He had given to their ancestors through Moses.

## Judges 3:5

The Israelites dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.

## Judges 3:6

They intermarried with them, taking their daughters as wives and giving their own daughters to their sons, and they served their gods.

---

## Judges 3:7

The Israelites did evil in the sight of the Lord; they forgot the Lord their God and served the Baals and the Asherahs.

## Judges 3:8

The Lord’s anger burned against Israel, and He sold them into the hands of Cushan-Rishathaim, king of Aram Naharaim, and the Israelites served him for eight years.

## Judges 3:9

When the Israelites cried out to the Lord, He raised up a deliverer for them, Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, who saved them.

## Judges 3:10

The Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he became Israel’s judge and went to war. The Lord delivered Cushan-Rishathaim, king of Aram, into his hands, and Othniel prevailed over him.

## Judges 3:11

The land had peace for forty years, until Othniel son of Kenaz died.

---

## Judges 3:12

Once again the Israelites did evil in the sight of the Lord, and because of this, the Lord strengthened Eglon, king of Moab, against Israel.

## Judges 3:13

Eglon gathered the Ammonites and Amalekites, and they attacked Israel, capturing the City of Palms.

## Judges 3:14

The Israelites served Eglon, king of Moab, for eighteen years.

## Judges 3:15

When the Israelites cried out to the Lord, He raised up a deliverer for them, Ehud, a left-handed man, the son of Gera the Benjamite. The Israelites sent him with tribute to Eglon, king of Moab.

## Judges 3:16

Ehud made a double-edged sword about a cubit long, which he strapped to his right thigh under his clothing.

## Judges 3:17

He presented the tribute to Eglon, king of Moab, who was an exceedingly large man.

## Judges 3:18

After presenting the tribute, Ehud sent away those who had carried it.

## Judges 3:19

But he himself turned back at the stone images near Gilgal and said, “I have a secret message for you, O king.” The king said, “Silence!” and all his attendants left.

## Judges 3:20

Ehud approached him while he was sitting alone in the cool upper room and said, “I have a message from God for you.” As the king rose from his seat,

## Judges 3:21

Ehud reached with his left hand, drew the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into the king’s abdomen.

## Judges 3:22

Even the handle sank in after the blade, and the fat closed over it, for he did not pull the sword out, and the refuse came out.

## Judges 3:23

Then Ehud went out to the porch, shutting the doors of the upper room behind him and locking them.

---

## Judges 3:24

After he had left, the servants came and found the doors of the upper room locked. They said, “He must be relieving himself in the inner room of the palace.”

## Judges 3:25

They waited to the point of embarrassment, but when he did not open the doors, they took a key and unlocked them. There they found their master fallen to the floor, dead.

## Judges 3:26

While they waited, Ehud escaped, passing by the stone images and fleeing to Seirah.

## Judges 3:27

When he arrived there, he sounded a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites went down with him from the hills, with him leading them.

## Judges 3:28

He said to them, “Follow me, for the Lord has given your enemies, the Moabites, into your hands.” They followed him and took control of the fords of the Jordan leading to Moab, allowing no one to cross over.

## Judges 3:29

At that time, they struck down about ten thousand Moabites, all robust and valiant men; not one escaped.

## Judges 3:30

That day Moab was subdued under the hand of Israel, and the land had peace for eighty years.

## Judges 3:31

After Ehud, Shamgar son of Anath arose, who struck down six hundred Philistines with an oxgoad. He also delivered Israel.
