# Judges Chapter 1

## Judges 1:1

After the death of Joshua, the Israelites inquired of the Lord, “Who shall go up first for us against the Canaanites to fight against them?”

## Judges 1:2

The Lord answered, “Judah shall go up. I have given the land into their hands.”

## Judges 1:3

Then the men of Judah said to the Simeonites their fellow Israelites, “Come up with us into our territory and help us fight against the Canaanites. We in turn will go with you into yours.” So the Simeonites went with them.

## Judges 1:4

When Judah attacked, the Lord gave the Canaanites and Perizzites into their hands, and they struck down ten thousand men at Bezek.

## Judges 1:5

It was there that they found Adoni-Bezek and fought against him, putting to flight the Canaanites and Perizzites.

## Judges 1:6

Adoni-Bezek fled, but they chased him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and big toes.

## Judges 1:7

Then Adoni-Bezek said, “Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off have picked up scraps under my table. Now God has repaid me.” They brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.

## Judges 1:8

The men of Judah attacked Jerusalem also and captured it. They put the city to the sword and set it on fire.

## Judges 1:9

After that, the men of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites living in the hill country, the Negev, and the western foothills.

## Judges 1:10

They marched against the Canaanites living in Hebron (formerly called Kiriath Arba) and defeated Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.

---

## Judges 1:11

From there they advanced against the people living in Debir (formerly called Kiriath Sepher).

## Judges 1:12

And Caleb said, “I will give my daughter Aksah in marriage to the one who attacks and captures Kiriath Sepher.”

## Judges 1:13

Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, captured it; so Caleb gave his daughter Aksah to him in marriage.

## Judges 1:14

When she came to Othniel, she urged him to ask her father for a field. When she got off her donkey, Caleb asked her, “What do you want?”

## Judges 1:15

She replied, “Give me a blessing. Since you have given me land in the Negev, give me also springs of water.” So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs.

## Judges 1:16

The descendants of Moses’ father-in-law, the Kenite, went up with the people of Judah from the City of Palms into the Desert of Judah, which is in the Negev near Arad. They settled among the people there.

---

## Judges 1:17

Then the men of Judah went with the Simeonites their fellow Israelites and attacked the Canaanites living in Zephath, and they totally destroyed the city. Therefore it was called Hormah.

## Judges 1:18

Judah also captured Gaza, Ashkelon and Ekron—each city with its territory.

## Judges 1:19

The Lord was with the men of Judah. They took possession of the hill country, but they were unable to drive out the people of the plains, because they had chariots fitted with iron.

## Judges 1:20

As Moses had promised, Hebron was given to Caleb, who drove out the three sons of Anak.

---

## Judges 1:21

The Benjamites, however, did not drive out the Jebusites who were living in Jerusalem. So to this day the Jebusites live there with the Benjamites.

---

## Judges 1:22

The tribes of Joseph also went up against Bethel, and the Lord was with them.

## Judges 1:23

When they sent men to spy out Bethel (formerly called Luz),

## Judges 1:24

the spies saw a man coming out of the city and said to him, “Show us how to get into the city, and we will see that you are treated well.”

## Judges 1:25

So he showed them, and they put the city to the sword but spared the man and his whole family.

## Judges 1:26

He then went to the land of the Hittites, where he built a city and named it Luz, which is its name to this day.

---

## Judges 1:27

But Manasseh did not drive out the people of Beth Shan or Taanach or Dor or Ibleam or Megiddo and their surrounding settlements, for the Canaanites were determined to live in that land.

## Judges 1:28

When Israel became strong, they subjected the Canaanites to forced labour but did not drive them out completely.

---

## Judges 1:29

Nor did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites living in Gezer, so they continued to live there among them.

## Judges 1:30

Zebulun did not drive out the Canaanites living in Kitron or Nahalol, so they lived among them, but Zebulun subjected them to forced labour.

## Judges 1:31

Nor did Asher drive out those living in Acco, Sidon, Ahlab, Akzib, Helbah, Aphek or Rehob.

## Judges 1:32

The Asherites lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land because they did not drive them out.

## Judges 1:33

Naphtali did not drive out those living in Beth Shemesh or Beth Anath, but lived among the Canaanites who were there. And the people of Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath became forced labour for them.

---

## Judges 1:34

The Amorites confined the Danites to the hill country, not allowing them to come down into the plain.

## Judges 1:35

And the Amorites were determined to hold out in Mount Heres, Aijalon, and Shaalbim. But when the power of the tribes of Joseph increased, they were subjected to forced labour.

## Judges 1:36

The boundary of the Amorites was from Scorpion Pass to Sela and beyond.
