# Judges Chapter 1

## Judges 1:1

Following the death of Joshua, the Israelites inquired of the Lord, “Who shall ascend first for us to combat the Canaanites?”

## Judges 1:2

The Lord replied, “Judah shall go up; I have delivered the land into his hands.”

## Judges 1:3

Judah then said to Simeon his brother, “Accompany me into the territory allotted to me, and let us fight the Canaanites together; and I will likewise go with you into your territory.” So Simeon went with him.

## Judges 1:4

Judah went up, and the Lord delivered the Canaanites and Perizzites into their hands, and they defeated ten thousand men at Bezek.

## Judges 1:5

They encountered Adoni-Bezek in Bezek and fought against him, defeating the Canaanites and Perizzites.

## Judges 1:6

Adoni-Bezek fled, but they pursued him, captured him, and severed his thumbs and big toes.

## Judges 1:7

Adoni-Bezek said, “Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes severed used to gather scraps under my table; as I have done, so God has repaid me.” They brought him to Jerusalem, where he died.

## Judges 1:8

The men of Judah then attacked Jerusalem and captured it, striking it with the sword and setting the city ablaze.

## Judges 1:9

Afterwards, Judah went down to fight the Canaanites residing in the hill country, the Negev, and the lowlands.

## Judges 1:10

Judah advanced against the Canaanites living in Hebron (formerly known as Kiriath Arba) and defeated Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.

## Judges 1:11

From there, they moved against the inhabitants of Debir (formerly called Kiriath Sepher).

## Judges 1:12

Caleb declared, “To the man who attacks and captures Kiriath Sepher, I will give my daughter Aksah as a wife.”

## Judges 1:13

Othniel, son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, captured it; so Caleb gave him his daughter Aksah in marriage.

## Judges 1:14

When she came to Othniel, she urged him to ask her father for a field. As she dismounted from her donkey, Caleb asked her, “What do you desire?”

## Judges 1:15

She answered, “Grant me a blessing. Since you have given me land in the Negev, give me also springs of water.” So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs.

## Judges 1:16

The descendants of the Kenite, Moses’ father-in-law, went up from the City of Palms with the people of Judah to the wilderness of Judah in the south of Arad, and they settled among the people.

## Judges 1:17

Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they attacked the Canaanites living in Zephath and utterly destroyed it. Thus the city was named Hormah.

## Judges 1:18

Judah also captured Gaza with its territory, Ashkelon with its territory, and Ekron with its territory.

## Judges 1:19

The Lord was with Judah, and they took possession of the hill country, but they could not drive out the inhabitants of the plains because they had iron chariots.

## Judges 1:20

Hebron was given to Caleb, as Moses had promised, and he expelled from there the three sons of Anak.

## Judges 1:21

The Benjamites did not drive out the Jebusites living in Jerusalem; so the Jebusites have lived with the Benjamites in Jerusalem to this day.

## Judges 1:22

The tribes of Joseph also went up against Bethel, and the Lord was with them.

## Judges 1:23

They sent men to spy out Bethel (formerly called Luz).

## Judges 1:24

The spies saw a man leaving the city and said to him, “Show us the entrance to the city, and we will treat you kindly.”

## Judges 1:25

He showed them the entrance to the city, and they struck it with the sword, but spared the man and his entire family.

## Judges 1:26

The man then went to the land of the Hittites, built a city, and named it Luz, which remains its name to this day.

## Judges 1:27

Manasseh did not take possession of Beth Shan and its villages, Taanach and its villages, Dor and its villages, Ibleam and its villages, or Megiddo and its villages; the Canaanites persisted in living in that land.

## Judges 1:28

When Israel grew strong, they subjected the Canaanites to forced labour but did not drive them out completely.

## Judges 1:29

Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites living in Gezer, so they continued to live among them.

## Judges 1:30

Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron or Nahalol; thus, the Canaanites lived among them and became subject to forced labour.

## Judges 1:31

Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, Sidon, Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, or Rehob.

## Judges 1:32

The Asherites lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the land because they did not drive them out.

## Judges 1:33

Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh or Beth Anath, but lived among the Canaanites; the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath became forced labourers for them.

## Judges 1:34

The Amorites confined the Danites to the hill country, not permitting them to descend to the valley.

## Judges 1:35

The Amorites persisted in living on Mount Heres, Aijalon, and Shaalbim, but when the power of the house of Joseph increased, they were subjected to forced labour.

## Judges 1:36

The boundary of the Amorites extended from the ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela and upward.
