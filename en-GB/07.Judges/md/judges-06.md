# Judges Chapter 6

## Judges 6:1

The Israelites acted wickedly in the sight of the Lord, and for seven years the Lord delivered them into the hands of the Midianites.

## Judges 6:2

The might of Midian was overwhelming against Israel. Consequently, the Israelites made for themselves shelters in mountain clefts, caves, and strongholds.

## Judges 6:3

Whenever the Israelites sowed their crops, the Midianites, Amalekites, and other eastern peoples would invade the land.

## Judges 6:4

They encamped on the land and devastated the crops all the way to Gaza, leaving no sustenance in Israel, neither sheep, ox, nor donkey.

## Judges 6:5

They came up with their livestock and tents, swarming like locusts. Their numbers and their camels were beyond counting; they invaded the land to lay it waste.

## Judges 6:6

Midian brought Israel to such poverty that the Israelites cried out to the Lord for help.

## Judges 6:7

As the Israelites cried out to the Lord due to Midian's oppression,

## Judges 6:8

the Lord sent them a prophet, who said, “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘I brought you up from Egypt, out of the house of slavery.

## Judges 6:9

I rescued you from the hand of the Egyptians and from all your oppressors; I drove them out before you and gave you their land.

## Judges 6:10

I said to you, “I am the Lord your God; do not fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell.” But you have not listened to me.’”

## Judges 6:11

The angel of the Lord came and sat under the oak in Ophrah that belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, where his son Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress to hide it from the Midianites.

## Judges 6:12

The angel of the Lord appeared to Gideon and said, “The Lord is with you, valiant warrior.”

## Judges 6:13

Gideon replied, “Pardon me, my lord, but if the Lord is with us, why has all this happened to us? Where are all His wonders that our ancestors recounted to us, saying, ‘Did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt?’ But now the Lord has abandoned us and handed us over to Midian.”

## Judges 6:14

The Lord turned to him and said, “Go in the strength you have and deliver Israel from Midian’s hand. Am I not sending you?”

## Judges 6:15

Gideon said, “Pardon me, my lord, but how can I save Israel? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my family.”

## Judges 6:16

The Lord assured him, “I will be with you, and you will strike down all the Midianites, leaving none.”

## Judges 6:17

Gideon replied, “If now I have found favour in your eyes, give me a sign that it is really you speaking to me.

## Judges 6:18

Please do not depart until I return and bring my offering and set it before you.” And the Lord said, “I will wait until you return.”

## Judges 6:19

Gideon went inside, prepared a young goat, and from an ephah of flour made unleavened bread. He put the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot, and brought them out and offered them under the oak.

## Judges 6:20

The angel of God instructed him, “Take the meat and the unleavened bread, place them on this rock, and pour out the broth.” And Gideon did so.

## Judges 6:21

Then the angel of the Lord touched the meat and the unleavened bread with the tip of the staff in his hand, and fire flared from the rock, consuming the meat and the bread. The angel of the Lord then vanished.

## Judges 6:22

When Gideon understood that it was the angel of the Lord, he exclaimed, “Alas, Sovereign Lord! I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face!”

## Judges 6:23

But the Lord said to him, “Peace be with you; do not be afraid. You are not going to die.”

## Judges 6:24

Gideon built an altar there to the Lord and called it The Lord is Peace. To this day, it stands in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.

## Judges 6:25

That same night the Lord said to him, “Take your father’s bull and a second bull seven years old, and tear down your father’s altar to Baal and cut down the Asherah pole beside it.

## Judges 6:26

Then build a proper altar to the Lord your God on the top of this height. Using the wood of the Asherah pole you cut down, offer the second bull as a burnt offering.”

## Judges 6:27

So Gideon took ten of his servants and did as the Lord had commanded. But because he was afraid of his family and the townspeople, he did it at night rather than in the daytime.

## Judges 6:28

In the morning, when the people of the town got up, they found Baal’s altar demolished, with the Asherah pole beside it cut down and the second bull sacrificed on the newly built altar.

## Judges 6:29

They asked each other, “Who did this?” After they had investigated, they were told, “Gideon son of Joash did it.”

## Judges 6:30

The people of the town demanded of Joash, “Bring out your son. He must die because he has torn down Baal’s altar and cut down the Asherah pole beside it.”

## Judges 6:31

But Joash replied to the hostile crowd, “Will you plead Baal’s cause? Will you save him? Whoever fights for him shall be put to death by morning! If Baal is truly a god, let him defend himself when someone breaks down his altar.”

## Judges 6:32

So because Gideon had broken down Baal’s altar, they gave him the name Jerub-Baal, saying, “Let Baal contend with him.”

## Judges 6:33

Now all the Midianites, Amalekites, and other eastern peoples joined forces, crossed over the Jordan, and camped in the Valley of Jezreel.

## Judges 6:34

Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet, summoning the Abiezrites to follow him.

## Judges 6:35

He sent messengers throughout Manasseh, calling them to arms, and also into Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, so they too went up to meet them.

## Judges 6:36

Gideon said to God, “If you intend to save Israel by my hand, as you have promised—

## Judges 6:37

behold, I will place a wool fleece on the threshing floor. If there is dew only on the fleece and all the ground is dry, then I will know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you have said.”

## Judges 6:38

And it was so. Gideon rose early the next day; he squeezed the fleece and wrung out the dew—a bowlful of water.

## Judges 6:39

Then Gideon said to God, “Please do not be angry with me. Let me make just one more request. Allow me one more test with the fleece, but this time let the fleece remain dry and let the ground be covered with dew.”

## Judges 6:40

That night God did as requested. Only the fleece was dry; all the ground was covered with dew.
