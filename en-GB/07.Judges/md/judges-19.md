# Judges Chapter 19

## Judges 19:1

In those days, Israel was without a king. A certain Levite residing in a remote part of the hill country of Ephraim took a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah.

## Judges 19:2

However, the concubine was unfaithful to him and left him, returning to her father’s house in Bethlehem, Judah, where she stayed for four months.

## Judges 19:3

Her husband then set out to persuade her to return, speaking kindly to her. He took with him his servant and two donkeys. She brought him into her father’s house, and her father was pleased to see him.

## Judges 19:4

The woman’s father urged him to stay, so he remained with him for three days, eating, drinking, and lodging there.

## Judges 19:5

On the fourth day, they rose early, and he prepared to leave. But the woman’s father said to his son-in-law, “Have something to eat to refresh yourself, and then you can go.”

## Judges 19:6

So the two of them sat down to eat and drink together. The woman’s father said, “Please stay another night and enjoy yourself.”

## Judges 19:7

When the man got up to depart, his father-in-law persuaded him, and he stayed another night.

## Judges 19:8

On the fifth day, he rose to leave early, but the woman’s father said, “Please, strengthen yourself and wait until the afternoon.” So the two of them ate together.

## Judges 19:9

When the man, along with his concubine and servant, got up to leave, his father-in-law said, “See, the day is nearly over. Spend the night here; enjoy yourself. Tomorrow morning you can rise early and be on your way home.”

## Judges 19:10

But the man was unwilling to stay another night, so he left and travelled towards Jebus (which is Jerusalem), with his two saddled donkeys and his concubine.

## Judges 19:11

As they neared Jebus, the day was almost gone. The servant said to his master, “Let us turn into this city of the Jebusites and spend the night.”

## Judges 19:12

His master replied, “We will not turn aside into a city of foreigners who are not Israelites. We will continue to Gibeah.”

## Judges 19:13

He added, “Come, let us try to reach Gibeah or Ramah and spend the night there.”

## Judges 19:14

So they continued on their way, and the sun set as they approached Gibeah in Benjamin.

## Judges 19:15

They stopped to spend the night in Gibeah. They sat in the city square, but no one offered them hospitality.

## Judges 19:16

That evening, an old man came in from his work in the fields. He was from the hill country of Ephraim and was living in Gibeah, though the people there were Benjaminites.

## Judges 19:17

When he saw the traveller in the city square, the old man asked, “Where are you going and where have you come from?”

## Judges 19:18

He answered, “We are travelling from Bethlehem in Judah to a remote area in the hill country of Ephraim, where I live. I have been to Bethlehem, and now I am going to the house of the Lord. No one has taken us in for the night.

## Judges 19:19

We have straw and fodder for our donkeys, and bread and wine for ourselves, your servants—me, the woman, and the young man with us. We lack nothing.”

## Judges 19:20

The old man said, “You are welcome at my house. Let me provide for all your needs. Only do not spend the night in the square.”

## Judges 19:21

So he took him into his house and fed his donkeys. After they washed their feet, they ate and drank.

## Judges 19:22

While they were enjoying themselves, some wicked men of the city surrounded the house. They pounded on the door and shouted to the old man, “Bring out the man who came to your house so we can have relations with him.”

## Judges 19:23

The owner of the house went outside and said, “No, my brothers, do not commit such a wicked act. Since this man is my guest, do not do this vile thing.

## Judges 19:24

Look, here is my virgin daughter and his concubine. I will bring them out to you now. Do with them as you please, but do not commit this vile act against this man.”

## Judges 19:25

But the men would not listen to him. So the man took his concubine and sent her outside to them. They raped her and abused her throughout the night, and at dawn, they let her go.

## Judges 19:26

As the day began to dawn, the woman returned to the house where her master was staying, collapsed at the door, and lay there until daylight.

## Judges 19:27

When her master got up in the morning, opened the door, and stepped out to continue on his way, he found his concubine lying at the doorway of the house, with her hands on the threshold.

## Judges 19:28

He said to her, “Get up; let’s go.” But there was no response. He put her on his donkey and set out for home.

## Judges 19:29

When he reached home, he took a knife and cut his concubine, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent them throughout the territory of Israel.

## Judges 19:30

Everyone who saw it said, “Such a thing has never been seen or done, not since the Israelites came up from Egypt. Consider it, make a plan, and speak up!”
