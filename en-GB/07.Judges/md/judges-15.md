# Judges Chapter 15

## Judges 15:1

Later on, during the wheat harvest, Samson took a young goat and went to visit his wife.  
He said, “I’m going to my wife’s room.” But her father would not let him go in.

## Judges 15:2

“I was so sure you hated her,” he said, “that I gave her to your companion.  
Isn’t her younger sister more attractive? Take her instead.”

## Judges 15:3

Samson said to them, “This time I have a right to get even with the Philistines; I will really harm them.”

## Judges 15:4

So he went out and caught three hundred foxes and tied them tail to tail in pairs.  
He then fastened a torch to every pair of tails,

## Judges 15:5

lit the torches and let the foxes loose in the standing grain of the Philistines.  
He burned up the shocks and standing grain, together with the vineyards and olive groves.

## Judges 15:6

When the Philistines asked, “Who did this?” they were told, “Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because his wife was given to his companion.”  
So the Philistines went up and burned her and her father to death.

## Judges 15:7

Samson said to them, “Since you’ve acted like this, I swear I won’t stop until I’ve taken revenge on you.”

## Judges 15:8

He attacked them viciously and slaughtered many of them.  
Then he went down and stayed in a cave in the rock of Etam.

## Judges 15:9

The Philistines went up and camped in Judah, spreading out near Lehi.

## Judges 15:10

The people of Judah asked, “Why have you come to fight us?”  
“We have come to take Samson prisoner,” they answered, “to do to him as he did to us.”

## Judges 15:11

Then three thousand men from Judah went down to the cave in the rock of Etam and said to Samson,  
“Don’t you realise that the Philistines rule over us? What have you done to us?”  
He answered, “I only did to them what they did to me.”

## Judges 15:12

They said to him, “We’ve come to tie you up and hand you over to the Philistines.”  
Samson said, “Swear to me that you won’t kill me yourselves.”

## Judges 15:13

“Agreed,” they answered. “We will only tie you up and hand you over to them. We will not kill you.”  
So they bound him with two new ropes and led him up from the rock.

## Judges 15:14

As he approached Lehi, the Philistines came toward him shouting.  
The Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon him.  
The ropes on his arms became like charred flax, and the bindings dropped from his hands.

## Judges 15:15

Finding a fresh jawbone of a donkey, he grabbed it and struck down a thousand men.

## Judges 15:16

Then Samson said,  
> “With a donkey’s jawbone  
> I have made donkeys of them.  
> With a donkey’s jawbone  
> I have killed a thousand men.”

---

## Judges 15:17

When he finished speaking, he threw away the jawbone; and the place was called Ramath Lehi.

## Judges 15:18

Because he was very thirsty, he cried out to the Lord,  
“You have given your servant this great victory. Must I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?”

## Judges 15:19

Then God opened up the hollow place in Lehi, and water came out of it.  
Samson drank, his strength returned, and he revived.  
So the spring was called En Hakkore, and it is still there in Lehi.

## Judges 15:20

Samson led Israel for twenty years in the days of the Philistines.
