# Judges Chapter 15

## Judges 15:1

After some time, during the wheat harvest, Samson went to visit his wife, bringing a young goat. He said, “I will go to my wife’s chamber.” But her father did not allow him to enter.

## Judges 15:2

Her father said, “I was certain you despised her, so I gave her to your companion. Isn’t her younger sister more beautiful? You may have her instead.”

## Judges 15:3

Samson replied to them, “This time I shall be without blame when I harm the Philistines.”

## Judges 15:4

So Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took torches, tying the foxes tail to tail in pairs and placing a torch between each pair of tails.

## Judges 15:5

He set the torches alight and released the foxes into the Philistines’ standing grain, burning both the shocks and the standing grain, as well as the vineyards and olive groves.

## Judges 15:6

When the Philistines inquired, “Who has done this?” they were informed, “Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because his wife was given to his companion.” So the Philistines went up and burned her and her father with fire.

## Judges 15:7

Samson said to them, “Since you have acted in this manner, I will not cease until I have taken my revenge on you.”

## Judges 15:8

He attacked them with great ferocity and slaughtered many. Then he went down and stayed in a cave in the rock of Etam.

## Judges 15:9

The Philistines went up and encamped in Judah, spreading out near Lehi.

## Judges 15:10

The men of Judah asked, “Why have you come against us?” They replied, “We have come to capture Samson, to do to him as he has done to us.”

## Judges 15:11

Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cave in the rock of Etam and said to Samson, “Do you not realise the Philistines rule over us? What have you done to us?” He answered, “I have done to them as they did to me.”

## Judges 15:12

They said to him, “We have come to bind you and hand you over to the Philistines.” Samson said, “Swear to me that you will not kill me yourselves.”

## Judges 15:13

They replied, “We agree; we will only bind you and hand you over to them. We will not kill you.” So they bound him with two new ropes and led him up from the rock.

## Judges 15:14

As he approached Lehi, the Philistines came shouting to meet him. The Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him, and the ropes on his arms became like charred flax, and the bindings dropped from his hands.

## Judges 15:15

Finding a fresh jawbone of a donkey, he reached out, took it, and killed a thousand men with it.

## Judges 15:16

Then Samson declared, “With a donkey’s jawbone, I have made heaps upon heaps; with a donkey’s jawbone, I have slain a thousand men.”

## Judges 15:17

When he had finished speaking, he threw away the jawbone, and he named the place Ramath Lehi.

## Judges 15:18

Feeling very thirsty, he called upon the Lord and said, “You have granted this great victory to your servant. Must I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?”

## Judges 15:19

Then God opened up the hollow place in Lehi, and water flowed from it. When Samson drank, his strength returned and he was revived. So the spring was named En Hakkore, and it remains in Lehi to this day.

## Judges 15:20

Samson judged Israel for twenty years during the days of the Philistines.
