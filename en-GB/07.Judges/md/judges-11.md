# Judges Chapter 11

## Judges 11:1

Jephthah the Gileadite was a valiant warrior, but he was the son of a prostitute. Gilead was his father.

## Judges 11:2

Gilead’s wife bore him sons, and when they were grown, they drove Jephthah away, saying, “You shall not share in our family inheritance, for you are the son of another woman.”

## Judges 11:3

So Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob, where a group of worthless men gathered around him and followed him.

## Judges 11:4

After some time, the Ammonites waged war against Israel.

## Judges 11:5

When the Ammonites fought against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to bring Jephthah back from the land of Tob.

## Judges 11:6

They said to Jephthah, “Come and be our leader so that we can fight against the Ammonites.”

## Judges 11:7

Jephthah replied to the elders of Gilead, “Did you not hate me and drive me from my father’s house? Why do you come to me now when you are in distress?”

## Judges 11:8

The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “For this reason we have returned to you now, that you may go with us to fight the Ammonites and become our leader over all the inhabitants of Gilead.”

## Judges 11:9

Jephthah said to them, “If you bring me back to fight the Ammonites and the Lord delivers them to me, shall I indeed be your leader?”

## Judges 11:10

The elders of Gilead answered, “The Lord is witness between us; we will do as you have said.”

## Judges 11:11

So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and commander over them. Jephthah repeated all his words before the Lord at Mizpah.

## Judges 11:12

Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites, asking, “What conflict exists between us that you have come to fight against my land?”

## Judges 11:13

The king of the Ammonites replied to Jephthah’s messengers, “When Israel came up from Egypt, they seized my land from the Arnon to the Jabbok and the Jordan. Now, return it peaceably.”

## Judges 11:14

Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the Ammonites,

## Judges 11:15

saying, “This is what Jephthah says: Israel did not take the land of Moab or the land of the Ammonites.

## Judges 11:16

When they came up from Egypt, Israel travelled through the wilderness to the Red Sea and then to Kadesh.

## Judges 11:17

Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, asking, ‘Please let us pass through your land,’ but the king of Edom would not listen. They also sent to the king of Moab, but he refused. So Israel remained at Kadesh.

## Judges 11:18

Then they journeyed through the wilderness, bypassing Edom and Moab, and came to the east of Moab, camping on the other side of the Arnon. They did not enter Moabite territory, for the Arnon was its border.

## Judges 11:19

Israel sent messengers to Sihon, king of the Amorites, ruler of Heshbon, saying, ‘Please let us pass through your land to our place.’

## Judges 11:20

But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory. He gathered all his troops, camped at Jahaz, and fought with Israel.

## Judges 11:21

The Lord, the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his people into Israel’s hands, and they defeated them. Israel took possession of all the land of the Amorites who inhabited that region.

## Judges 11:22

They captured all the territory from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the wilderness to the Jordan.

## Judges 11:23

Now that the Lord, the God of Israel, has driven the Amorites out before His people Israel, should you then possess it?

## Judges 11:24

Do you not possess what Chemosh your god gives you? Likewise, whatever the Lord our God has given us, we will possess.

## Judges 11:25

Are you any better than Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever strive against Israel or wage war with them?

## Judges 11:26

For three hundred years, Israel occupied Heshbon, Aroer, and the surrounding settlements, and all the towns along the Arnon. Why did you not reclaim them during that time?

## Judges 11:27

I have not wronged you, but you are wronging me by waging war against me. Let the Lord, the Judge, decide the dispute today between the Israelites and the Ammonites.”

## Judges 11:28

The king of the Ammonites, however, ignored the message Jephthah sent him.

---

## Judges 11:29

Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah. He passed through Gilead and Manasseh, and through Mizpah of Gilead, advancing against the Ammonites.

## Judges 11:30

Jephthah made a vow to the Lord: “If You deliver the Ammonites into my hands,

## Judges 11:31

then whatever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me when I return victorious from the Ammonites shall be the Lord’s, and I will offer it as a burnt offering.”

## Judges 11:32

Jephthah crossed over to fight the Ammonites, and the Lord delivered them into his hands.

## Judges 11:33

He struck them down from Aroer to the vicinity of Minnith, twenty towns, as far as Abel Keramim. Thus the Ammonites were subdued before the Israelites.

## Judges 11:34

When Jephthah returned to his home in Mizpah, his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and dancing. She was his only child; besides her, he had neither son nor daughter.

## Judges 11:35

Upon seeing her, he tore his clothes and said, “Alas, my daughter! You have brought me low, and you are among those who trouble me, for I have given my word to the Lord, and I cannot retract it.”

## Judges 11:36

She replied, “My father, you have given your word to the Lord; do to me as you have promised, since the Lord has avenged you of your enemies, the Ammonites.”

## Judges 11:37

She then said to her father, “Grant me this request: allow me two months to roam the hills and weep with my friends because I will never marry.”

## Judges 11:38

He said, “Go.” So he sent her away for two months. She and her friends went into the hills and wept over her virginity.

## Judges 11:39

After two months, she returned to her father, and he did to her as he had vowed. And she was a virgin. From this arose a custom in Israel,

## Judges 11:40

that each year the daughters of Israel go out for four days to commemorate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite.
