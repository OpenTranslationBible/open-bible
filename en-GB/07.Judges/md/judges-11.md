# Judges Chapter 11

## Judges 11:1

Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty warrior. His father was Gilead; his mother was a prostitute.

## Judges 11:2

Gilead’s wife also bore him sons, and when they were grown, they drove Jephthah away. “You shall have no inheritance in our family,” they said, “because you are the son of another woman.”

## Judges 11:3

So Jephthah fled from his brothers and settled in the land of Tob, where a group of adventurers gathered around him and followed him.

## Judges 11:4

Some time later, when the Ammonites were fighting against Israel,

## Judges 11:5

the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob.

## Judges 11:6

“Come,” they said, “be our commander, so we can fight the Ammonites.”

## Judges 11:7

Jephthah said to them, “Didn’t you hate me and drive me from my father’s house? Why do you come to me now, when you’re in trouble?”

## Judges 11:8

The elders of Gilead said to him, “Nevertheless, we are turning to you now. Come with us to fight the Ammonites, and you will be head over all who live in Gilead.”

## Judges 11:9

Jephthah answered, “Suppose you take me back to fight the Ammonites, and the Lord gives them to me—will I really be your head?”

## Judges 11:10

The elders of Gilead replied, “The Lord is our witness; we will certainly do as you say.”

## Judges 11:11

So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and commander over them.  
And he repeated all his words before the Lord in Mizpah.

## Judges 11:12

Then Jephthah sent messengers to the Ammonite king with the question: “What do you have against me that you have attacked my land?”

## Judges 11:13

The king of the Ammonites answered Jephthah’s messengers, “When Israel came up out of Egypt, they took away my land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, all the way to the Jordan. Now give it back peacefully.”

## Judges 11:14

Jephthah sent back messengers to the Ammonite king,

## Judges 11:15

saying: “This is what Jephthah says: Israel did not take the land of Moab or the land of the Ammonites.

## Judges 11:16

When they came up out of Egypt, Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea and on to Kadesh.

## Judges 11:17

Then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, ‘Give us permission to go through your country.’ But the king of Edom would not listen.  
They sent also to the king of Moab, and he refused. So Israel stayed at Kadesh.

## Judges 11:18

Next they travelled through the wilderness, skirted Edom and Moab, passed along the eastern side of the land of Moab, and camped on the far side of the Arnon.  
They did not enter the territory of Moab, for the Arnon was its border.

## Judges 11:19

Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon, and said to him, ‘Let us pass through your country to our own place.’

## Judges 11:20

But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory.  
He mustered all his troops and encamped at Jahaz and fought with Israel.

## Judges 11:21

Then the Lord, the God of Israel, gave Sihon and all his men into Israel’s hands, and they defeated them.  
Israel took over all the land of the Amorites who lived in that country,

## Judges 11:22

capturing all of it from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the desert to the Jordan.

## Judges 11:23

“Now since the Lord, the God of Israel, has driven out the Amorites before His people Israel, what right have you to take it over?

## Judges 11:24

Will you not take what your god Chemosh gives you? Likewise, whatever the Lord our God has given us, we will possess.

## Judges 11:25

Are you better than Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever quarrel with Israel or fight with them?

## Judges 11:26

For three hundred years Israel occupied Heshbon, Aroer, the surrounding settlements and all the towns along the Arnon.  
Why didn’t you retake them during that time?

## Judges 11:27

I have not wronged you, but you are doing me wrong by waging war against me.  
Let the Lord, the Judge, decide the dispute this day between the Israelites and the Ammonites.”

## Judges 11:28

The king of Ammon, however, paid no attention to the message Jephthah sent him.

---

## Judges 11:29

Then the Spirit of the Lord came on Jephthah.  
He crossed Gilead and Manasseh, passed through Mizpah of Gilead, and advanced against the Ammonites.

## Judges 11:30

And Jephthah made a vow to the Lord: “If You give the Ammonites into my hands,

## Judges 11:31

whatever comes out of the door of my house to meet me when I return in triumph from the Ammonites will be the Lord’s, and I will offer it as a burnt offering.”

## Judges 11:32

Then Jephthah went over to fight the Ammonites, and the Lord gave them into his hands.

## Judges 11:33

He devastated twenty towns from Aroer to the vicinity of Minnith, as far as Abel Keramim.  
Thus Israel subdued Ammon.

## Judges 11:34

When Jephthah returned to his home in Mizpah, who should come out to meet him but his daughter, dancing to the sound of tambourines!  
She was his only child. Except for her, he had neither son nor daughter.

## Judges 11:35

When he saw her, he tore his clothes and cried, “Oh no, my daughter! You have brought me down and I am devastated.  
I have given my word to the Lord and cannot break it.”

## Judges 11:36

“My father,” she replied, “you have given your word to the Lord.  
Do to me just as you promised, now that the Lord has avenged you of your enemies, the Ammonites.

## Judges 11:37

But grant me this one request,” she said. “Give me two months to roam the hills and weep with my friends, because I will never marry.”

## Judges 11:38

“You may go,” he said. And he let her go for two months.  
She and her friends went into the hills and wept because she would never marry.

## Judges 11:39

After the two months, she returned to her father, and he did to her as he had vowed.  
And she was a virgin. From this comes the Israelite tradition

## Judges 11:40

that each year the young women of Israel go out for four days to commemorate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite.
