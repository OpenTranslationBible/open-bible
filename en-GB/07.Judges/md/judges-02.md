# Judges Chapter 2

## Judges 2:1

The angel of the Lord ascended from Gilgal to Bochim and declared, “I brought you up from Egypt and led you into the land I promised to your forefathers. I assured you, ‘I will never break my covenant with you,

## Judges 2:2

and you shall not make a covenant with the inhabitants of this land; you shall tear down their altars.’ But you have not obeyed me; what is this that you have done?

## Judges 2:3

Therefore, I also declared, ‘I will not drive them out before you; they will become thorns in your sides, and their gods will be a snare to you.’”

## Judges 2:4

When the angel of the Lord spoke these words to all the Israelites, the people raised their voices and wept aloud,

## Judges 2:5

and they named that place Bochim. There they offered sacrifices to the Lord.

## Judges 2:6

After Joshua had dismissed the people, the Israelites went, each to their own inheritance, to take possession of the land.

## Judges 2:7

The people served the Lord throughout the lifetime of Joshua and the elders who outlived him and had witnessed all the great deeds the Lord had done for Israel.

## Judges 2:8

Joshua, son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died at the age of one hundred and ten.

## Judges 2:9

They buried him in the territory of his inheritance, at Timnath Heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.

## Judges 2:10

After that entire generation had been gathered to their ancestors, another generation arose who neither knew the Lord nor the works he had done for Israel.

## Judges 2:11

Then the Israelites did evil in the sight of the Lord and served the Baals.

## Judges 2:12

They abandoned the Lord, the God of their ancestors, who had brought them out of Egypt. They followed and worshipped various gods of the peoples around them, provoking the Lord to anger.

## Judges 2:13

They forsook the Lord and served Baal and the Ashtaroth.

## Judges 2:14

The Lord’s anger burned against Israel, and he handed them over to raiders who plundered them. He sold them into the hands of their enemies all around, and they could no longer withstand their foes.

## Judges 2:15

Wherever they went, the hand of the Lord was against them to bring calamity, as he had sworn to them. They were in great distress.

## Judges 2:16

Then the Lord appointed judges who rescued them from those who plundered them.

## Judges 2:17

Yet they did not listen to their judges, but prostituted themselves to other gods and worshipped them. They quickly turned aside from the way their ancestors had walked, who had obeyed the Lord’s commands.

## Judges 2:18

Whenever the Lord raised up a judge for them, he was with the judge and saved them from the hands of their enemies during the judge’s lifetime; for the Lord was moved by their groaning under those who oppressed and afflicted them.

## Judges 2:19

But when the judge died, the people returned to ways even more corrupt than those of their ancestors, following other gods and serving and worshipping them. They refused to abandon their evil practices and stubborn ways.

## Judges 2:20

Therefore, the Lord’s anger burned against Israel, and he said, “Because this nation has violated the covenant I ordained for their ancestors and has not listened to my voice,

## Judges 2:21

I will no longer drive out before them any of the nations Joshua left when he died.

## Judges 2:22

I will use these nations to examine Israel and see whether they will keep the way of the Lord and walk in it as their ancestors did.”

---

## Judges 2:23

Thus, the Lord allowed those nations to remain, not removing them swiftly; and he did not hand them over to Joshua.
