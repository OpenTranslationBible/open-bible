The next day, the people rose early, built an altar, and presented burnt offerings and peace offerings.

## Judges 21:5

The Israelites then asked, “Who among all the tribes of Israel failed to come up to the Lord at the assembly?” For they had taken a solemn oath concerning anyone who did not come up to the Lord at Mizpah, saying, “He shall surely be put to death.”

The Israelites grieved for their brother Benjamin, saying, “Today one tribe is cut off from Israel.”

They asked, “Which one of the tribes of Israel did not come up to the Lord at Mizpah?” They found that no one from Jabesh-gilead had come to the camp for the assembly.

The Benjamites returned at that time, and they gave them the women of Jabesh-gilead who had been spared, but there were not enough for them.

## Judges 21:15

The people mourned for Benjamin, as the Lord had allowed a void to occur among the tribes of Israel.

The elders of the assembly said, “What shall we do for wives for those who remain, since the women of Benjamin have been destroyed?”

## Judges 21:17

“There must be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin,” they said, “so that a tribe will not be wiped out from Israel.”

## Judges 21:18

“But we cannot give them wives from our daughters,” they said, “for the Israelites have sworn, ‘Cursed be anyone who gives a wife to a Benjamite.’”

and watch. When the daughters of Shiloh come out to join in the dances, rush out from the vineyards and each seize a wife from the daughters of Shiloh, then return to the land of Benjamin.

## Judges 21:22

When their fathers or brothers come to complain to us, we will say, ‘Do us the kindness of allowing them, because we did not take wives for them during the war. You will not be guilty of breaking your oath, as you did not give your daughters to them.’”

The Benjamites did so and took wives according to their number from those who danced, whom they seized. Then they returned to their inheritance, rebuilt the towns, and settled in them.

## Judges 21:24

At that time, the Israelites departed from there, each to his tribe and family, and returned to his inheritance.

## Judges 21:25

In those days, Israel had no king; everyone did what was right in his own eyes.
