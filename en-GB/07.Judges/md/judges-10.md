## Judges 10:6

Once again, the Israelites did evil in the sight of the Lord. They worshipped the Baals and the Ashtaroth, as well as the gods of Aram, Sidon, Moab, the Ammonites, and the Philistines. They abandoned the Lord and ceased to serve Him.

## Judges 10:7

The Lord's anger burned against Israel, and He handed them over to the Philistines and the Ammonites.

## Judges 10:8

That year, they oppressed and crushed the Israelites. For eighteen years, they oppressed all the Israelites east of the Jordan in Gilead, the land of the Amorites.

## Judges 10:9

The Ammonites also crossed the Jordan to wage war against Judah, Benjamin, and the house of Ephraim, causing great distress to Israel.

## Judges 10:10

The Israelites cried out to the Lord, confessing, “We have sinned against You by forsaking our God and serving the Baals.”

## Judges 10:11

The Lord responded to the Israelites, “Did I not rescue you from the Egyptians, the Amorites, the Ammonites, and the Philistines?

## Judges 10:12

When the Sidonians, Amalekites, and Maonites oppressed you, you cried out to Me, and I delivered you from their hands.

## Judges 10:13

Yet you have forsaken Me and served other gods; therefore, I will no longer save you.

## Judges 10:14

Go and cry out to the gods you have chosen. Let them deliver you in your time of trouble.”

## Judges 10:15

But the Israelites pleaded with the Lord, “We have sinned. Do with us whatever You see fit, but please rescue us today.”

## Judges 10:16

They removed the foreign gods from among them and served the Lord, and He could no longer bear the misery of Israel.

## Judges 10:17

The Ammonites were called to arms and camped in Gilead, while the Israelites assembled and camped at Mizpah.

## Judges 10:18

The leaders of Gilead said to one another, “Whoever will take the lead in attacking the Ammonites shall become the head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.”
