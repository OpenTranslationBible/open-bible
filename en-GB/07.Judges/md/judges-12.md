# Judges Chapter 12

## Judges 12:1

The men of Ephraim were called out, and they crossed over to Zaphon. They said to Jephthah, “Why did you go to fight the Ammonites without inviting us to go with you? We will burn your house down on you!”

## Judges 12:2

Jephthah replied, “I and my people were in a significant conflict with the Ammonites, and I did call you, but you did not rescue me from their hands.

## Judges 12:3

When I realised you would not help, I risked my life and crossed over to fight the Ammonites, and the Lord gave me victory over them. So why have you come today to fight against me?”

they would say, “Please say ‘Shibboleth.’” If he said, “Sibboleth,” because he could not pronounce it correctly, they would seize him and kill him at the fords of the Jordan. At that time, forty-two thousand Ephraimites fell.
