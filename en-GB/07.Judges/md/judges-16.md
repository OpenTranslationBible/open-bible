# Judges Chapter 16

## Judges 16:1

Samson went to Gaza and saw a prostitute there, and he spent the night with her.

## Judges 16:2

The people of Gaza were informed, “Samson is here.” They encircled the place and lay in wait for him all night at the city gate, remaining silent throughout the night, saying, “At dawn, we will kill him.”

## Judges 16:3

Samson lay until midnight, and then he arose and seized the doors of the city gate along with the two posts, and tore them loose, bar and all. He placed them on his shoulders and carried them to the top of the hill facing Hebron.

## Judges 16:4

Some time later, he fell in love with a woman in the Valley of Sorek named Delilah.

## Judges 16:5

The leaders of the Philistines approached her and said, “Entice him to reveal the source of his great strength and how we may overpower him, so we can bind him and subdue him. Each of us will give you eleven hundred pieces of silver.”

## Judges 16:6

Delilah asked Samson, “Please tell me the secret of your great strength and how you can be bound and subdued.”

## Judges 16:7

Samson told her, “If anyone ties me with seven fresh bowstrings that have not been dried, I will become as weak as any other man.”

## Judges 16:8

The leaders of the Philistines brought her seven fresh bowstrings that had not been dried, and she bound him with them.

## Judges 16:9

With men hidden in the room, she called out, “Samson, the Philistines are upon you!” But he snapped the bowstrings as easily as a piece of string snaps near a flame. So the secret of his strength was not discovered.

## Judges 16:10

Delilah said to Samson, “You have made a fool of me and lied to me. Now tell me how you can be bound.”

## Judges 16:11

He replied, “If anyone ties me securely with new ropes that have never been used, I will become as weak as any other man.”

## Judges 16:12

So Delilah took new ropes and bound him with them. Then, with men hidden in the room, she called out, “Samson, the Philistines are upon you!” But he snapped the ropes off his arms like threads.

## Judges 16:13

Delilah said to Samson, “All this time you have made a fool of me and lied to me. Tell me how you can be bound.” He said, “If you weave the seven locks of my hair into the fabric on the loom and fasten it with the pin, I will become as weak as any other man.” So while he slept, Delilah wove the seven locks of his hair into the fabric.

## Judges 16:14

And she fastened it with the pin and called out, “Samson, the Philistines are upon you!” He awoke from his sleep and pulled out the pin and the loom, with the fabric.

## Judges 16:15

Then she said to him, “How can you say, ‘I love you,’ when you will not confide in me? This is the third time you have made a fool of me and have not told me the secret of your great strength.”

## Judges 16:16

With persistent nagging, she pressed him day after day until he was tired to death.

## Judges 16:17

So he revealed everything to her. “No razor has ever touched my head,” he said, “for I have been a Nazirite dedicated to God from my mother’s womb. If my head were shaved, my strength would leave me, and I would be as weak as any other man.”

## Judges 16:18

When Delilah realised he had told her everything, she sent word to the leaders of the Philistines, “Come back once more; he has revealed everything to me.” So the leaders returned with the silver in their hands.

## Judges 16:19

She lulled him to sleep on her lap and called for a man to shave off the seven locks of his hair. Thus, she began to subdue him, and his strength left him.

## Judges 16:20

She called out, “Samson, the Philistines are upon you!” He awoke and thought, “I will go out as before and shake myself free.” But he did not realise that the Lord had departed from him.

## Judges 16:21

The Philistines seized him, gouged out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza. They bound him with bronze shackles and set him to grinding grain in the prison.

## Judges 16:22

However, the hair on his head began to grow again after it had been shaved.

## Judges 16:23

The leaders of the Philistines gathered to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to celebrate, saying, “Our god has delivered Samson, our enemy, into our hands.”

## Judges 16:24

When the people saw him, they praised their god, saying, “Our god has delivered our enemy into our hands, the one who devastated our land and killed many of us.”

## Judges 16:25

While they were in high spirits, they called for Samson to entertain them. So they brought him from the prison, and he performed for them. They placed him between the pillars.

## Judges 16:26

Samson said to the servant who held his hand, “Place me where I can feel the pillars that support the temple, so that I may lean against them.”

## Judges 16:27

The temple was crowded with men and women, and all the leaders of the Philistines were there. On the roof were about three thousand men and women watching Samson perform.

## Judges 16:28

Then Samson prayed to the Lord, “Sovereign Lord, remember me. Please, God, strengthen me just once more, so that I may with one blow take vengeance on the Philistines for my two eyes.”

## Judges 16:29

Samson reached for the two central pillars on which the temple stood, bracing himself against them, his right hand on one and his left hand on the other.

## Judges 16:30

Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines!” He pushed with all his might, and the temple collapsed on the leaders and all the people in it. Thus he killed more in his death than he had during his life.

## Judges 16:31

Then his brothers and his father’s whole family came down to collect him. They took him and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of Manoah his father. He had judged Israel for twenty years.
