## Judges 17:2

He said to his mother, “The eleven hundred pieces of silver that were taken from you, about which you pronounced a curse and spoke in my hearing, behold, I have the silver; I took it.” His mother replied, “Blessed be my son by the Lord.”

## Judges 17:3

He returned the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother, and she said, “I solemnly dedicate my silver to the Lord for my son to make a carved image and a metal image; I will return it to you.”

## Judges 17:4

After he returned the silver to his mother, she took two hundred pieces of silver and gave them to a silversmith, who made them into a carved image and a metal image, which were placed in Micah’s house.

## Judges 17:5

Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and some household idols, and he consecrated one of his sons to become his priest.
