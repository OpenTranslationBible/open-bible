# Judges Chapter 17

## Judges 17:1

There was a man named Micah, from the hill country of Ephraim,

## Judges 17:2

who said to his mother, “The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from you and about which I heard you utter a curse — I have that silver with me; I took it.”  
Then his mother said, “The Lord bless you, my son!”

## Judges 17:3

When he returned the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, she said,  
“I consecrate this silver to the Lord for my son to make an image overlaid with silver. I will give it back to you.”

## Judges 17:4

So after he returned the silver to his mother, she took two hundred shekels and gave them to a silversmith,  
who made them into an idol cast in the shape of an image.  
And it was put in Micah’s house.

## Judges 17:5

Now this man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and some household gods  
and installed one of his sons as his priest.

## Judges 17:6

In those days Israel had no king; everyone did what was right in his own eyes.

## Judges 17:7

A young Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, who had been living within the clan of Judah,

## Judges 17:8

left that town in search of another place to stay.  
On his journey he came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah.

## Judges 17:9

Micah asked him, “Where are you from?”  
“I’m a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah,” he said, “and I’m looking for a place to stay.”

## Judges 17:10

Then Micah said to him, “Live with me and be my father and priest, and I’ll give you ten shekels of silver a year, your clothes, and food.”

## Judges 17:11

So the Levite agreed to live with him, and the young man became like one of his sons to him.

## Judges 17:12

Then Micah installed the Levite, and the young man became his priest and lived in his house.

## Judges 17:13

And Micah said, “Now I know that the Lord will be good to me, since I have a Levite as my priest.”
