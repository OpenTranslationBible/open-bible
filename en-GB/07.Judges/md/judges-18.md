# Judges Chapter 18

## Judges 18:1

In those days, Israel had no king, and the tribe of the Danites was seeking a territory of their own to settle in, for up to that time they had not been allotted an inheritance among the tribes of Israel.

## Judges 18:2

So the Danites sent from their clan five capable men from Zorah and Eshtaol to scout the land and explore it. They instructed them, “Go and explore the land.” When they reached the hill country of Ephraim, they came to the house of Micah and stayed there overnight.

## Judges 18:3

As they approached Micah’s house, they recognised the voice of the young Levite and turned aside to speak with him, asking, “Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? What do you have here?”

## Judges 18:4

He replied, “This is what Micah has done for me: he has hired me, and I have become his priest.”

## Judges 18:5

Then they said to him, “Please inquire of God to find out if our journey will be successful.”

## Judges 18:6

The priest said to them, “Go in peace; your journey has the Lord’s approval.”

## Judges 18:7

So the five men departed and arrived at Laish, where they observed that the people were living in security, in the manner of the Sidonians, peaceful and unsuspecting. Their land lacked nothing and was prosperous. They were far from the Sidonians and had no dealings with anyone else.

## Judges 18:8

When they returned to their brothers at Zorah and Eshtaol, their fellow Danites asked them, “What is your report?”

## Judges 18:9

They answered, “Let us go up and attack them, for we have seen the land, and it is very good. Why are you hesitating? Do not delay to go and take possession of the land.

## Judges 18:10

When you arrive, you will find a people unsuspecting and a spacious land that God has given into your hands, a place where there is no lack of anything on the earth.”

## Judges 18:11

Then six hundred men from the Danites, armed for battle, set out from Zorah and Eshtaol.

## Judges 18:12

On their journey, they camped near Kiriath Jearim in Judah. This is why the place is called Mahaneh Dan to this day, located west of Kiriath Jearim.

## Judges 18:13

From there, they continued to the hill country of Ephraim and came to Micah’s house.

## Judges 18:14

Then the five men who had scouted the land of Laish said to their kinsmen, “Do you know that in these houses there is an ephod, some household gods, and a carved image overlaid with silver? Now you know what to do.”

## Judges 18:15

So they turned aside and went to the house of the young Levite at Micah’s place and greeted him.

## Judges 18:16

The six hundred Danites, ready for battle, stood at the entrance of the gate.

## Judges 18:17

The five men who had scouted the land went inside and took the carved image, the ephod, the household gods, and the cast metal image, while the priest and the six hundred armed men stood at the entrance of the gate.

## Judges 18:18

When these men entered Micah’s house and took the carved image, the ephod, the household gods, and the cast metal image, the priest asked them, “What are you doing?”

## Judges 18:19

They replied, “Be silent; put your hand over your mouth and come with us, and be a father and priest to us. Is it better for you to be a priest to one man’s household, or to a tribe and clan in Israel?”

## Judges 18:20

The priest was delighted. He took the ephod, the household gods, and the carved image and went with the people.

## Judges 18:21

Putting their children, livestock, and possessions in front of them, they turned and left.

## Judges 18:22

When they had gone some distance from Micah’s house, the men who lived near Micah’s house gathered together and overtook the Danites.

## Judges 18:23

As they shouted after them, the Danites turned and said to Micah, “What is the matter with you that you have called out your men to fight?”

## Judges 18:24

He replied, “You have taken the gods I made and my priest, and have gone away. What else do I have? How can you ask, ‘What is the matter with you?’”

## Judges 18:25

The Danites said to him, “Do not raise your voice against us, or some fierce men may attack you, and you and your family will lose your lives.”

## Judges 18:26

So the Danites went on their way, and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back home.

## Judges 18:27

They took what Micah had made and his priest and went on to Laish, to a people living in peace and security. They attacked them with the sword and burned down their city.

## Judges 18:28

There was no one to rescue them because they lived far from Sidon and had no dealings with anyone else. The city was in a valley near Beth Rehob. The Danites rebuilt the city and settled there.

## Judges 18:29

They named it Dan, after their ancestor Dan, who was born to Israel, though the city was formerly called Laish.

## Judges 18:30

The Danites set up for themselves the carved image, and Jonathan son of Gershom, the son of Moses, and his sons were priests for the tribe of Dan until the time of the captivity of the land.

## Judges 18:31

They continued to use the carved image Micah had made, all the time the house of God was in Shiloh.
