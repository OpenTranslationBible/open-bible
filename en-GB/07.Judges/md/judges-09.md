# Judges Chapter 9

## Judges 9:1

Abimelech, the son of Jerubbaal, went to Shechem to his mother's kin and spoke to them and to the whole family of his mother's father, saying,

## Judges 9:2

"Speak to all the leaders of Shechem, 'Which is better for you: to have seventy men, all the sons of Jerubbaal, rule over you, or just one man?' Remember, I am your own flesh and blood."

## Judges 9:3

His mother's relatives spoke all these words on his behalf to the leaders of Shechem, and they were inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, "He is our relative."

## Judges 9:4

They gave him seventy pieces of silver from the temple of Baal-Berith, and with it, Abimelech hired worthless and reckless men who became his followers.

## Judges 9:5

He went to his father's house in Ophrah and killed his brothers, the sons of Jerubbaal, seventy men, on one stone. But Jotham, the youngest son of Jerubbaal, survived because he hid himself.

## Judges 9:6

Then all the leaders of Shechem and Beth-Millo gathered together and made Abimelech king by the oak of the memorial stone in Shechem.

## Judges 9:7

When Jotham was informed, he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim and shouted to them, "Listen to me, leaders of Shechem, that God may listen to you.

## Judges 9:8

The trees once set out to appoint a king over themselves, and they said to the olive tree, 'Rule over us!'

## Judges 9:9

But the olive tree replied, 'Should I give up my oil, by which both gods and humans are honoured, to wave over the trees?'

## Judges 9:10

Then the trees said to the fig tree, 'You, come and reign over us!'

## Judges 9:11

But the fig tree replied, 'Should I give up my sweetness and my good fruit to wave over the trees?'

## Judges 9:12

Then the trees said to the vine, 'You, come and reign over us!'

## Judges 9:13

But the vine replied, 'Should I give up my wine, which cheers both gods and humans, to wave over the trees?'

## Judges 9:14

Finally, all the trees said to the bramble, 'You, come and reign over us!'

## Judges 9:15

The bramble said to the trees, 'If you are truly anointing me as king over you, come and take refuge in my shade; but if not, let fire come out of the bramble and consume the cedars of Lebanon.'

## Judges 9:16

"So now, if you have acted with honesty and integrity in making Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have treated him as he deserved—

## Judges 9:17

for my father fought for you and risked his life to rescue you from the hand of Midian;

## Judges 9:18

but today you have risen against my father's house, killed his sons, seventy men, on one stone, and made Abimelech, the son of his female slave, king over the leaders of Shechem because he is your relative—

## Judges 9:19

if you have acted with honesty and integrity towards Jerubbaal and his house today, then be joyful about Abimelech, and may he also be joyful about you.

## Judges 9:20

But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech and consume the leaders of Shechem and Beth-Millo; and let fire come out from the leaders of Shechem and Beth-Millo and consume Abimelech."

## Judges 9:21

Then Jotham fled, escaping to Beer, and he lived there because he was afraid of his brother Abimelech.

## Judges 9:22

Abimelech ruled over Israel for three years.

## Judges 9:23

Then God sent a spirit of discord between Abimelech and the leaders of Shechem, and the leaders of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech,

## Judges 9:24

so that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might be avenged, and the responsibility for their blood be laid on their brother Abimelech, who killed them, and on the leaders of Shechem, who helped him murder his brothers.

## Judges 9:25

The leaders of Shechem set men in ambush against him on the hilltops, and they robbed everyone who passed by them on the road; and this was reported to Abimelech.

## Judges 9:26

Now Gaal, the son of Ebed, came with his relatives and crossed into Shechem, and the leaders of Shechem put their confidence in him.

## Judges 9:27

They went out into the fields, gathered the grapes of their vineyards, trod them, and held a festival. They went into the house of their god, ate and drank, and cursed Abimelech.

## Judges 9:28

Then Gaal, the son of Ebed, said, "Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jerubbaal, and is Zebul not his deputy? Serve the men of Hamor, Shechem's father! Why should we serve him?

## Judges 9:29

If only this people were under my command! Then I would get rid of him." And he said to Abimelech, "Enlarge your army and come out!"

## Judges 9:30

When Zebul, the leader of the city, heard what Gaal, the son of Ebed, said, he was very angry.

## Judges 9:31

Under cover, he sent messengers to Abimelech, saying, "Gaal, the son of Ebed, and his relatives have come to Shechem and are stirring up the city against you.

## Judges 9:32

Now then, arise by night, you and the people who are with you, and lie in wait in the field.

## Judges 9:33

In the morning, at sunrise, advance against the city. When he and the people who are with him come out against you, do to them whatever you can."

## Judges 9:34

So Abimelech and all the people with him got up at night and took up concealed positions near Shechem in four companies.

## Judges 9:35

Now Gaal, the son of Ebed, went out and stood at the entrance of the city gate, just as Abimelech and the people with him rose from the ambush.

## Judges 9:36

When Gaal saw them, he said to Zebul, "Look, people are coming down from the tops of the mountains!" Zebul replied, "You are mistaking the shadows of the mountains for men."

## Judges 9:37

But Gaal spoke again, "Look, people are coming down from the highest part of the land, and one company is coming from the direction of the diviners' tree."

## Judges 9:38

Then Zebul said to him, "Where is your boasting now, you who said, 'Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?' Are these not the people you ridiculed? Go out and fight them!"

## Judges 9:39

So Gaal went out in the sight of the leaders of Shechem and fought Abimelech.

## Judges 9:40

Abimelech pursued him, and he fled before him, and many fell wounded up to the entrance of the gate.

## Judges 9:41

Abimelech stayed in Arumah, and Zebul drove Gaal and his relatives out of Shechem.

## Judges 9:42

The next day, the people went out to the fields, and this was reported to Abimelech.

## Judges 9:43

So he took his men, divided them into three companies, and set an ambush in the fields. When he saw the people coming out of the city, he attacked them.

## Judges 9:44

Abimelech and the company with him rushed forward to a position at the entrance of the city gate. Then the other two companies attacked those in the fields and struck them down.

## Judges 9:45

Abimelech fought against the city all that day, captured it, and killed its people. Then he destroyed the city and scattered salt over it.

## Judges 9:46

When all the leaders of the tower of Shechem heard about it, they entered the inner chamber of the temple of El-Berith.

## Judges 9:47

It was reported to Abimelech that all the leaders of the tower of Shechem had gathered together.

## Judges 9:48

So Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people with him. Abimelech took an axe in his hand, cut down a branch from the trees, lifted it to his shoulder, and said to the people with him, "What you have seen me do, hurry and do likewise."

## Judges 9:49

So all the people cut down their branches and followed Abimelech. They piled them against the inner chamber and set it on fire over those inside, so all the people in the tower of Shechem died, about a thousand men and women.

## Judges 9:50

Abimelech then went to Thebez, besieged it, and captured it.

## Judges 9:51

Inside the city, however, was a strong tower, and all the men and women, along with all the leaders of the city, fled there, locked themselves in, and climbed to the roof of the tower.

## Judges 9:52

Abimelech went to the tower and attacked it, approaching the entrance to set it on fire.

## Judges 9:53

But a woman dropped an upper millstone on Abimelech's head, cracking his skull.

## Judges 9:54

Hurriedly, he called to his young armour-bearer and said, "Draw your sword and kill me, so that they can't say, 'A woman killed him.'" So the young man ran him through, and he died.

## Judges 9:55

When the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they each went home.

## Judges 9:56

Thus God repaid the wickedness that Abimelech had done to his father by murdering his seventy brothers.

## Judges 9:57

God also returned all the wickedness of the men of Shechem on their heads, and the curse of Jotham, the son of Jerubbaal, came upon them.
