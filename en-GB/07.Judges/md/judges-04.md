# Judges Chapter 4

## Judges 4:1

Once again, the Israelites did evil in the sight of the Lord after Ehud had died.

## Judges 4:2

Thus, the Lord delivered them into the hands of Jabin, the king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. Sisera, his army commander, was stationed in Harosheth-hagoyim.

## Judges 4:3

Because Sisera had nine hundred iron chariots and had harshly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years, they cried out to the Lord for help.

## Judges 4:4

At that time, Deborah, a prophetess and the wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel.

## Judges 4:5

She held court under the Palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites came up to her to have their disputes settled.

## Judges 4:6

She sent for Barak, son of Abinoam, from Kedesh in Naphtali, and said to him, “The Lord, the God of Israel, commands you: ‘Go, take ten thousand men from Naphtali and Zebulun and lead them up to Mount Tabor.

## Judges 4:7

I will draw Sisera, the commander of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and troops to the Kishon River, and I will deliver him into your hands.’”

## Judges 4:8

Barak replied to her, “If you will go with me, I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go.”

## Judges 4:9

Deborah answered, “Certainly, I will go with you. However, the honour will not be yours on this journey, for the Lord will hand Sisera over to a woman.” So Deborah went with Barak to Kedesh.

## Judges 4:10

Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh, and ten thousand men went up with him; Deborah also accompanied him.

## Judges 4:11

Now Heber the Kenite had separated from the other Kenites, the descendants of Hobab, Moses’ father-in-law, and pitched his tent by the great tree in Zaanannim near Kedesh.

## Judges 4:12

When Sisera was informed that Barak son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor,

## Judges 4:13

Sisera summoned all his chariots, nine hundred iron chariots, and all his men, from Harosheth-hagoyim to the Kishon River.

## Judges 4:14

Then Deborah said to Barak, “Arise! For this is the day the Lord has given Sisera into your hands. Has not the Lord gone ahead of you?” So Barak went down Mount Tabor with ten thousand men following him.

## Judges 4:15

The Lord routed Sisera and all his chariots and army by the sword before Barak, and Sisera abandoned his chariot and fled on foot.

## Judges 4:16

Barak pursued the chariots and army as far as Harosheth-hagoyim, and all of Sisera’s troops fell by the sword; not a single man was left.

## Judges 4:17

Meanwhile, Sisera fled on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, for there was peace between Jabin king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.

## Judges 4:18

Jael went out to meet Sisera and said to him, “Come, my lord, come right in. Do not be afraid.” So he entered her tent, and she covered him with a blanket.

## Judges 4:19

He said to her, “I am thirsty. Please give me some water to drink.” She opened a skin of milk, gave him a drink, and covered him.

## Judges 4:20

He instructed her, “Stand in the doorway of the tent, and if anyone comes and asks, ‘Is anyone here?’ say, ‘No.’”

## Judges 4:21

But Jael, Heber’s wife, took a tent peg and a hammer, and went quietly to him while he lay fast asleep, exhausted. She drove the peg through his temple into the ground, and he died.

## Judges 4:22

Just then, Barak came in pursuit of Sisera, and Jael went out to meet him. She said, “Come, I will show you the man you are seeking.” So he went in with her, and there lay Sisera with the tent peg through his temple—dead.

## Judges 4:23

On that day, God subdued Jabin, the king of Canaan, before the Israelites.

## Judges 4:24

And the hand of the Israelites pressed harder and harder against Jabin, king of Canaan, until they destroyed him.
