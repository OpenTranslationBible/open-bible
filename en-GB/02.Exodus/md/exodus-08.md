# Exodus Chapter 8

## Exodus 8:1
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘This is what the Lord declares: Let my people go, so that they may serve me.

## Exodus 8:2
But if you refuse to let them go, I will bring a plague of frogs upon your entire land.

## Exodus 8:3
The Nile will teem with frogs, which will come up and enter your palace, your bedroom, and your bed, and into the houses of your officials and your people, and into your ovens and kneading troughs.

## Exodus 8:4
The frogs will invade you, your people, and all your officials.’”

## Exodus 8:5
Then the Lord said to Moses, “Instruct Aaron, ‘Stretch out your hand with your staff over the rivers, streams, and ponds, and make frogs come up on the land of Egypt.’”

## Exodus 8:6
So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and frogs came up and covered the land.

## Exodus 8:7
Yet the magicians did the same with their secret arts, bringing frogs up on the land of Egypt.

## Exodus 8:8
Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Entreat the Lord to remove the frogs from me and my people, and I will let your people go to sacrifice to the Lord.”

## Exodus 8:9
Moses said to Pharaoh, “I leave to you the honour of deciding when I should pray for you, your officials, and your people, that the frogs may be removed from you and your houses, leaving only those in the Nile.”

## Exodus 8:10
Pharaoh replied, “Tomorrow.” Moses said, “It will be as you say, so that you may know there is no one like the Lord our God.

## Exodus 8:11
The frogs will depart from you, your houses, your officials, and your people; they will remain only in the Nile.”

## Exodus 8:12
After Moses and Aaron left Pharaoh, Moses cried out to the Lord concerning the frogs He had inflicted upon Pharaoh.

## Exodus 8:13
And the Lord did as Moses requested. The frogs died in the houses, courtyards, and fields.

## Exodus 8:14
They were gathered into heaps, and the land reeked of them.

## Exodus 8:15
But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and did not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the Lord had said.

## Exodus 8:16
Then the Lord said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the ground,’ and it will become gnats throughout the land of Egypt.”

## Exodus 8:17
They did this, and when Aaron stretched out his hand with the staff and struck the dust of the ground, gnats came upon people and animals. All the dust throughout the land of Egypt became gnats.

## Exodus 8:18
The magicians tried to produce gnats by their secret arts, but they could not. There were gnats on people and animals everywhere.

## Exodus 8:19
The magicians said to Pharaoh, “This is the work of God.” But Pharaoh’s heart was stubborn, and he would not listen, just as the Lord had said.

## Exodus 8:20
Then the Lord said to Moses, “Rise early in the morning and confront Pharaoh as he goes to the river and say to him, ‘This is what the Lord says: Let my people go, so that they may serve me.

## Exodus 8:21
If you refuse to let my people go, I will send swarms of flies on you, your officials, your people, and into your houses. The houses of the Egyptians will be full of flies, and even the ground will be covered with them.

## Exodus 8:22
But on that day I will set apart the land of Goshen, where my people live, so that no swarms of flies will be there, so that you will know that I, the Lord, am in this land.

## Exodus 8:23
I will show a difference between my people and your people. This sign will happen tomorrow.’”

## Exodus 8:24
And the Lord did so. Dense swarms of flies came into Pharaoh’s palace and into the houses of his officials; throughout Egypt, the land was ruined by the flies.

## Exodus 8:25
Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Go, sacrifice to your God here in this land.”

## Exodus 8:26
But Moses said, “That would not be right. The sacrifices we offer the Lord our God would be detestable to the Egyptians. If we offer sacrifices that are detestable in their eyes, will they not stone us?

## Exodus 8:27
We must take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the Lord our God, as He has directed us.”

## Exodus 8:28
Pharaoh said, “I will let you go to offer sacrifices to the Lord your God in the wilderness, but you must not go very far. Now pray for me.”

## Exodus 8:29
Moses answered, “As soon as I leave you, I will pray to the Lord, and tomorrow the flies will depart from Pharaoh, his officials, and his people. Only let Pharaoh be sure not to act deceitfully again by not letting the people go to offer sacrifices to the Lord.”

## Exodus 8:30
Moses then departed from Pharaoh and prayed to the Lord,

## Exodus 8:31
and the Lord did as Moses asked. The flies left Pharaoh, his officials, and his people; not a fly remained.

## Exodus 8:32
Yet Pharaoh hardened his heart once more, and he did not let the people go.
