# Exodus Chapter 32

## Exodus 32:1
When the people saw that Moses was delayed in coming down from the mountain, they gathered around Aaron and said, “Come, make us a god who will go before us. As for this Moses, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him.”

## Exodus 32:2
Aaron said to them, “Remove the gold earrings that your wives, your sons, and your daughters are wearing, and bring them to me.”

## Exodus 32:3
So all the people removed their gold earrings and brought them to Aaron.

## Exodus 32:4
He took the gold from their hands and fashioned it with a tool into a cast metal calf. Then they said, “This is your god, Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt.”

## Exodus 32:5
When Aaron saw this, he built an altar in front of it and proclaimed, “Tomorrow shall be a festival to the Lord.”

## Exodus 32:6
So the next day the people rose early, offered burnt offerings, and presented peace offerings. Afterwards, they sat down to eat and drink and rose up to engage in revelry.

## Exodus 32:7
Then the Lord said to Moses, “Go down at once, for your people, whom you brought up from the land of Egypt, have become corrupt.

## Exodus 32:8
They have quickly turned aside from the way I commanded them. They have made themselves a cast metal calf, have bowed down to it, and have sacrificed to it, saying, ‘This is your god, Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt.’”

## Exodus 32:9
The Lord said to Moses, “I have seen this people, and they are indeed a stiff-necked people.

## Exodus 32:10
Now leave Me alone, so that My anger may burn against them and I may destroy them. Then I will make you into a great nation.”

## Exodus 32:11
But Moses sought the favour of the Lord his God, saying, “Lord, why does Your anger burn against Your people, whom You brought out from the land of Egypt with great power and a mighty hand?

## Exodus 32:12
Why should the Egyptians say, ‘He brought them out with evil intent, to kill them in the mountains and to wipe them off the face of the earth’? Turn from Your fierce anger; relent and do not bring disaster upon Your people.

## Exodus 32:13
Remember Your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, to whom You swore by Your own self: ‘I will make your descendants as countless as the stars in the sky, and I will give your descendants all this land I promised them, and it will be their inheritance forever.’”

## Exodus 32:14
So the Lord relented from the harm He had threatened to do to His people.

## Exodus 32:15
Moses turned and went down the mountain with the two tablets of the testimony in his hands. They were inscribed on both sides, front and back.

## Exodus 32:16
The tablets were crafted by God; the writing was God's own writing, engraved on the tablets.

## Exodus 32:17
When Joshua heard the sound of the people shouting, he said to Moses, “There is the sound of war in the camp.”

## Exodus 32:18
But Moses replied, “It is not the sound of victory, nor is it the sound of defeat; it is the sound of singing that I hear.”

## Exodus 32:19
As soon as Moses approached the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, his anger burned, and he threw the tablets from his hands, shattering them at the foot of the mountain.

## Exodus 32:20
He took the calf they had made, burned it with fire, ground it to powder, scattered it on the water, and made the Israelites drink it.

## Exodus 32:21
Moses said to Aaron, “What did these people do to you, that you have brought such a great sin upon them?”

## Exodus 32:22
Aaron replied, “Do not let the anger of my lord burn; you know the people yourself, that they are prone to evil.

## Exodus 32:23
They said to me, ‘Make us a god who will go before us; as for this Moses, who brought us up from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him.’

## Exodus 32:24
So I said to them, ‘Whoever has any gold jewellery, let them take it off.’ They gave it to me, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf!”

## Exodus 32:25
When Moses saw that the people were out of control—for Aaron had let them get out of control to the point of becoming a laughingstock among their enemies—

## Exodus 32:26
Moses stood at the entrance to the camp and said, “Whoever is for the Lord, come to me.” And all the sons of Levi gathered to him.

## Exodus 32:27
He said to them, “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘Each man strap a sword to his side. Go back and forth through the camp from one end to the other, each killing his brother, friend, and neighbour.’”

## Exodus 32:28
The sons of Levi did as Moses commanded, and that day about three thousand of the people fell.

## Exodus 32:29
Then Moses said, “Dedicate yourselves today to the Lord—for you have been against your own sons and brothers—so that He may bestow a blessing upon you today.”

## Exodus 32:30
The following day Moses said to the people, “You have committed a great sin. But now I will go up to the Lord; perhaps I can make amends for your sin.”

## Exodus 32:31
So Moses returned to the Lord and said, “Oh, what a great sin these people have committed! They have made themselves a god of gold.

## Exodus 32:32
But now, if You will forgive their sin, please do so; but if not, please blot me out from the book You have written.”

## Exodus 32:33
The Lord replied to Moses, “Whoever has sinned against Me, I will remove from My book.

## Exodus 32:34
Now go, lead the people to the place I told you about. Behold, My angel shall go before you. Nevertheless, on the day when I punish, I will punish them for their sin.”

## Exodus 32:35
Then the Lord struck the people with a plague because of what they did with the calf Aaron had made.
