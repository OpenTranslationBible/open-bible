# Exodus Chapter 32

## Exodus 32:1

When the people saw that Moses was delayed in coming down from the mountain, they gathered around Aaron and said, “Come, make gods who will go before us. As for this Moses who brought us out of Egypt, we don’t know what has happened to him.”

## Exodus 32:2

Aaron answered them, “Take off the gold earrings that your wives, sons, and daughters are wearing, and bring them to me.”

## Exodus 32:3

So all the people took off their earrings and brought them to Aaron.

## Exodus 32:4

He took what they gave him, melted it down, and shaped it into an image of a calf using a tool. Then they said, “These are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.”

## Exodus 32:5

When Aaron saw this, he built an altar in front of the calf and announced, “Tomorrow there will be a festival to the Lord.”

## Exodus 32:6

So the next day the people rose early and offered burnt offerings and brought fellowship offerings. Afterward, they sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in revelry.

## Exodus 32:7

Then the Lord said to Moses, “Go down at once, for your people, whom you brought up out of Egypt, have corrupted themselves.

## Exodus 32:8

They have quickly turned away from what I commanded them and have made a cast image of a calf. They have bowed down to it, sacrificed to it, and said, ‘These are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.’”

## Exodus 32:9

The Lord said to Moses, “I have seen these people, and they are indeed a stiff-necked people.

## Exodus 32:10

Now leave Me alone so that My anger may burn against them and that I may destroy them. Then I will make you into a great nation.”

## Exodus 32:11

But Moses pleaded with the Lord his God, “Lord, why should Your anger burn against Your people, whom You brought out of Egypt with great power and a mighty hand?

## Exodus 32:12

Why should the Egyptians say, ‘He brought them out with evil intent, to kill them in the mountains and wipe them off the face of the earth’? Turn from Your fierce anger; relent and do not bring disaster on Your people.

## Exodus 32:13

Remember Your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, to whom You swore by Your own self: ‘I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and give them all this land I promised.’”

## Exodus 32:14

Then the Lord relented and did not bring on His people the disaster He had threatened.

## Exodus 32:15

Moses turned and went down the mountain with the two tablets of the covenant law in his hands. The tablets were inscribed on both sides, front and back.

## Exodus 32:16

The tablets were the work of God; the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets.

## Exodus 32:17

When Joshua heard the noise of the people shouting, he said to Moses, “There is the sound of battle in the camp.”

## Exodus 32:18

Moses replied,

> “It is not the sound of victory,  
> nor is it the sound of defeat;  
> It is the sound of singing that I hear.”

## Exodus 32:19

As Moses approached the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, his anger burned, and he threw the tablets out of his hands, breaking them at the foot of the mountain.

## Exodus 32:20

He took the calf they had made, burned it in the fire, ground it to powder, scattered it on the water, and made the Israelites drink it.

## Exodus 32:21

He said to Aaron, “What did these people do to you, that you led them into such great sin?”

## Exodus 32:22

“Don’t be angry, my lord,” Aaron answered. “You know how prone these people are to evil.

## Exodus 32:23

They said to me, ‘Make us gods who will go before us. As for this Moses, we don’t know what has happened to him.’

## Exodus 32:24

So I told them, ‘Bring me your gold.’ They gave it to me, I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf!”

## Exodus 32:25

Moses saw that the people were running wild and that Aaron had let them get out of control and become a laughingstock to their enemies.

## Exodus 32:26

So he stood at the entrance to the camp and said, “Whoever is for the Lord, come to me.” And all the Levites rallied to him.

## Exodus 32:27

Then he said to them, “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Each man is to strap a sword to his side. Go back and forth through the camp from one end to the other, killing your brother, friend, and neighbour.”

## Exodus 32:28

The Levites did as Moses commanded, and that day about three thousand of the people died.

## Exodus 32:29

Then Moses said, “You have been set apart to the Lord today, for you were against your own sons and brothers, and He has blessed you this day.”

## Exodus 32:30

The next day Moses said to the people, “You have committed a great sin. But now I will go up to the Lord; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.”

## Exodus 32:31

So Moses went back to the Lord and said, “What a great sin these people have committed! They have made themselves gods of gold.

## Exodus 32:32

But now, please forgive their sin—but if not, then blot me out of the book You have written.”

## Exodus 32:33

The Lord replied to Moses, “Whoever has sinned against Me I will blot out of My book.

## Exodus 32:34

Now go, lead the people to the place I spoke of, and My angel will go before you. However, when the time comes for Me to punish, I will punish them for their sin.”

## Exodus 32:35

And the Lord struck the people with a plague because of what they did with the calf Aaron had made.
