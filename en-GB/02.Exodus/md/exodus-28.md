## Exodus 28:4

“Select two onyx stones and inscribe them with the names of the sons of Israel,

## Exodus 28:10

six names on one stone, and the remaining six on the other, according to their birth order.

## Exodus 28:11

Engrave the names of the sons of Israel on the two stones as a jeweller engraves a seal, and mount them in gold filigree settings.

## Exodus 28:12

Attach the stones to the shoulder pieces of the ephod as memorial stones for the sons of Israel. Aaron shall bear their names on his shoulders as a memorial before the Lord.

## Exodus 28:14

and two braided chains of pure gold, like a rope, and attach these chains to the settings.

## Exodus 28:28

The rings of the breastpiece are to be tied to the rings of the ephod with a violet cord, so that it is on the waistband and the breastpiece does not swing out from the ephod.

## Exodus 28:29

Whenever Aaron enters the Holy Place, he shall bear the names of the sons of Israel on the breastpiece of decision over his heart as a continual memorial before the Lord.

## Exodus 28:30

Place the Urim and Thummim in the breastpiece of decision, so they may be over Aaron’s heart whenever he enters the presence of the Lord. Thus Aaron shall always bear the means of making decisions for the Israelites over his heart before the Lord.

## Exodus 28:34

A golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate, all around the hem of the robe.

## Exodus 28:35

Aaron must wear it when he ministers, so that the sound of the bells will be heard when he enters and leaves the Holy Place before the Lord, so that he will not die.

## Exodus 28:36
