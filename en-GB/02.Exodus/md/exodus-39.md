# Exodus Chapter 39

## Exodus 39:1
From the blue, purple and scarlet yarn they made woven garments for ministering in the Holy Place. They also made the sacred garments for Aaron, as the Lord had commanded Moses.

## Exodus 39:2
They made the ephod of gold and of blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and of finely twisted linen.

## Exodus 39:3
They hammered out thin sheets of gold and cut them into fine strands to work into the blue, purple and scarlet yarn and the fine linen, all crafted with skill.

## Exodus 39:4
They made shoulder pieces for the ephod, joined at the two edges.

## Exodus 39:5
Its waistband was made of the same materials and was of one piece with the ephod, as the Lord had commanded.

## Exodus 39:6
They mounted the onyx stones in gold filigree and engraved them with the names of the sons of Israel, as a seal is engraved.

## Exodus 39:7
Then they fastened the stones on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as memorial stones for the sons of Israel, as the Lord had commanded Moses.

## Exodus 39:8
They made the breastpiece, the work of a skilled craftsman, like the ephod: of gold, and of blue, purple and scarlet yarn, and finely twisted linen.

## Exodus 39:9
It was square—a span long and a span wide—and folded double.

## Exodus 39:10
They mounted four rows of gemstones on it: the first row was carnelian, chrysolite and beryl;

## Exodus 39:11
the second row was turquoise, lapis lazuli and emerald;

## Exodus 39:12
the third row was jacinth, agate and amethyst;

## Exodus 39:13
the fourth row was topaz, onyx and jasper. They were mounted in gold settings.

## Exodus 39:14
There were twelve stones, one for each of the names of the sons of Israel, each engraved like a seal.

## Exodus 39:15
For the breastpiece they made braided chains of pure gold, like a rope.

## Exodus 39:16
They made two gold filigree settings and two gold rings, and fastened the rings to the two corners of the breastpiece.

## Exodus 39:17
They attached the gold chains to the rings at the corners of the breastpiece,

## Exodus 39:18
and the other ends of the chains to the settings, attaching them to the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front.

## Exodus 39:19
They made two more gold rings and attached them to the other two corners of the breastpiece on the inside edge facing the ephod.

## Exodus 39:20
They made two more gold rings and attached them to the bottom of the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front, near the seam above the waistband.

## Exodus 39:21
Then they tied the rings of the breastpiece to the rings of the ephod with blue cord, so that it rested above the waistband and did not swing loose, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.

## Exodus 39:22
They made the robe of the ephod entirely of blue cloth—the work of a weaver—

## Exodus 39:23
with an opening in the centre of the robe like the opening of a collar, and a band around the opening so that it would not tear.

## Exodus 39:24
They made pomegranates of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen around the hem of the robe.

## Exodus 39:25
They also made bells of pure gold and attached them around the hem between the pomegranates.

## Exodus 39:26
The bells and pomegranates alternated around the hem of the robe—to be worn by Aaron when he ministered, as the Lord commanded.

## Exodus 39:27
For Aaron and his sons, they made tunics of fine linen—the work of a weaver—

## Exodus 39:28
as well as turbans and caps of fine linen, and sashes of finely twisted linen with blue, purple and scarlet yarn—embroidered as the Lord had commanded Moses.

## Exodus 39:29
They made the plate, the sacred emblem, out of pure gold and engraved on it like a seal: HOLY TO THE LORD.

## Exodus 39:30
They fastened it to the turban with a blue cord, as the Lord had commanded Moses.

## Exodus 39:31
So all the work on the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, was completed. The Israelites did everything just as the Lord had commanded.

## Exodus 39:32
They brought the tabernacle to Moses—the tent and all its furnishings: hooks, frames, crossbars, posts and bases;

## Exodus 39:33
the covering of ram skins dyed red and the covering of durable leather, the curtain shielding the ark;

## Exodus 39:34
the ark of the covenant law with its poles and atonement cover;

## Exodus 39:35
the table with all its articles and the bread of the Presence;

## Exodus 39:36
the pure gold lampstand with its row of lamps and accessories, and the oil for the light;

## Exodus 39:37
the gold altar, the anointing oil, the fragrant incense, and the curtain for the entrance to the tent;

## Exodus 39:38
the bronze altar with its grating and poles and all its utensils; the basin with its stand;

## Exodus 39:39
the curtains of the courtyard with its posts and bases, the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard, the ropes and tent pegs—all the furnishings for the tabernacle.

## Exodus 39:40
The woven garments worn for ministering in the sanctuary, both the sacred garments for Aaron and the garments for his sons, were exactly as the Lord had commanded Moses.

## Exodus 39:41
The Israelites had done all the work just as the Lord had commanded.

## Exodus 39:42
Moses inspected the work and saw that they had done it just as the Lord had commanded. So Moses blessed them.
