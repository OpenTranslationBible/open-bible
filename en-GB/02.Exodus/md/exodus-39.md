# Exodus Chapter 39

## Exodus 39:1
From the violet, purple, and scarlet yarn, they crafted finely woven garments for ministering in the sanctuary, along with the sacred garments for Aaron, as the Lord instructed Moses.

## Exodus 39:2
The ephod was made of gold, and of violet, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely twisted linen.

## Exodus 39:3
They hammered out gold sheets and cut them into threads to be woven into the violet, purple, and scarlet yarn, and the fine linen, the work of skilled hands.

## Exodus 39:4
They fashioned shoulder pieces for the ephod, which were attached at its two upper corners.

## Exodus 39:5
The skilfully woven waistband of the ephod was of the same workmanship and materials: gold, violet, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely twisted linen, as the Lord commanded Moses.

## Exodus 39:6
They set the onyx stones in gold filigree settings, engraving them like a seal with the names of the sons of Israel.

## Exodus 39:7
These were placed on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as memorial stones for the sons of Israel, as the Lord commanded Moses.

## Exodus 39:8
The breastpiece was crafted by a skilled embroiderer, like the ephod, of gold, and of violet, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely twisted linen.

## Exodus 39:9
It was square and folded double, a span in length and width.

## Exodus 39:10
They mounted four rows of precious stones on it. The first row was ruby, topaz, and emerald;

## Exodus 39:11
the second row was turquoise, sapphire, and a clear gem;

## Exodus 39:12
the third row was jacinth, agate, and a purple stone;

## Exodus 39:13
the fourth row was beryl, onyx, and jasper. These were set in gold filigree settings.

## Exodus 39:14
There were twelve stones, each engraved like a seal with the name of one of the twelve tribes of Israel.

## Exodus 39:15
For the breastpiece, they fashioned chains of pure gold, twisted like cords.

## Exodus 39:16
They crafted two gold filigree settings and two gold rings, and fastened the rings to the two corners of the breastpiece.

## Exodus 39:17
The two gold chains were attached to the rings at the corners of the breastpiece.

## Exodus 39:18
The other ends of the chains were fastened to the two settings, attaching them to the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front.

## Exodus 39:19
They made two gold rings and attached them to the other two corners of the breastpiece, on the inner edge next to the ephod.

## Exodus 39:20
They also made two more gold rings and attached them to the bottom of the shoulder pieces of the ephod, at the front, near the seam above the waistband.

## Exodus 39:21
The rings of the breastpiece were tied to the rings of the ephod with a violet cord, so that the breastpiece would remain attached to the waistband and not swing out, as the Lord commanded Moses.

## Exodus 39:22
The robe of the ephod was made entirely of violet cloth, the work of a weaver.

## Exodus 39:23
It had an opening in the centre, like the opening of a coat of mail, with a binding around the opening to prevent tearing.

## Exodus 39:24
They made pomegranates of violet, purple, and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen around the hem of the robe.

## Exodus 39:25
Pure gold bells were made and placed between the pomegranates around the hem.

## Exodus 39:26
The bells and pomegranates alternated around the hem of the robe for ministering, as the Lord commanded Moses.

## Exodus 39:27
Tunics of finely woven linen were made for Aaron and his sons.

## Exodus 39:28
They also made the turban of fine linen, the decorated caps, and the undergarments of finely twisted linen.

## Exodus 39:29
The sash was crafted from finely twisted linen and violet, purple, and scarlet yarn, the work of an embroiderer, as the Lord commanded Moses.

## Exodus 39:30
They made the plate, the sacred emblem, of pure gold and engraved on it, like an inscription on a seal: "Holy to the Lord."

## Exodus 39:31
A violet cord was attached to it to fasten it to the turban, as the Lord commanded Moses.

## Exodus 39:32
Thus, all the work on the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, was completed. The Israelites did everything as the Lord commanded Moses.

## Exodus 39:33
They brought the tabernacle to Moses: the tent and all its furnishings, its clasps, frames, crossbars, posts, and bases;

## Exodus 39:34
the covering of ram skins dyed red, the covering of fine leather, and the shielding curtain;

## Exodus 39:35
the ark of the covenant with its poles and the atonement cover;

## Exodus 39:36
the table with all its implements and the bread of the Presence;

## Exodus 39:37
the pure gold lampstand with its lamps in a row and all its accessories, and the olive oil for the light;

## Exodus 39:38
the golden altar, the anointing oil, the fragrant incense, and the curtain for the entrance to the tent;

## Exodus 39:39
the bronze altar with its bronze grating, its poles and all its implements; the basin with its stand;

## Exodus 39:40
the curtains of the courtyard with its posts and bases, and the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard; the ropes and tent pegs for the courtyard; all the equipment for the service of the tabernacle, the tent of meeting;

## Exodus 39:41
and the woven garments used for ministering in the sanctuary, both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons when serving as priests.

## Exodus 39:42
The Israelites had done all the work just as the Lord had commanded Moses.

## Exodus 39:43
Moses reviewed the work and saw that they had done it just as the Lord had commanded. So Moses blessed them.
