# Exodus Chapter 30

## Exodus 30:1
“Construct an altar from acacia wood as a place for burning incense.

## Exodus 30:2
It shall be square, measuring a cubit in length and a cubit in width, and two cubits in height; its horns shall be of one piece with it.

## Exodus 30:3
Overlay the top, sides, and horns with pure gold, and create a gold border around it.

## Exodus 30:4
Fashion two gold rings beneath the border on opposite sides to hold the poles for carrying it.

## Exodus 30:5
The poles shall be made of acacia wood and overlaid with gold.

## Exodus 30:6
Position the altar in front of the veil that is near the ark of the covenant, before the atonement cover that is over the ark where I will meet with you.

## Exodus 30:7
Aaron shall burn aromatic incense on it every morning when he tends the lamps.

## Exodus 30:8
When Aaron lights the lamps at twilight, he shall burn incense again. This incense shall burn perpetually before the Lord throughout your generations.

## Exodus 30:9
Do not offer any foreign incense, burnt offering, grain offering, or pour a drink offering on this altar.

## Exodus 30:10
Aaron shall make atonement on its horns once a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonement. This shall be a lasting ordinance for generations; it is most holy to the Lord.”

## Exodus 30:11
The Lord spoke to Moses,

## Exodus 30:12
“When you take a census of the Israelites, each person must give a ransom for his life to the Lord when counted, so that no plague will come upon them during the census.

## Exodus 30:13
Each person who is counted shall give a half shekel according to the sanctuary shekel, which is twenty gerahs. This half shekel is a contribution to the Lord.

## Exodus 30:14
Everyone twenty years old or more who is counted shall give this offering to the Lord.

## Exodus 30:15
The wealthy shall not contribute more, nor the poor less, than the half shekel when giving the offering to the Lord to make atonement for your lives.

## Exodus 30:16
Collect the atonement money from the Israelites and allocate it for the service of the tent of meeting. It will be a memorial for the Israelites before the Lord, making atonement for your lives.”

## Exodus 30:17
The Lord then spoke to Moses,

## Exodus 30:18
“Create a bronze basin with a bronze stand for washing, and place it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and fill it with water.

## Exodus 30:19
Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and feet with water from it.

## Exodus 30:20
Whenever they enter the tent of meeting or approach the altar to minister by offering a food sacrifice to the Lord, they must wash with water so that they will not die.

## Exodus 30:21
They must wash their hands and feet so that they will not die. This shall be a permanent statute for Aaron and his descendants throughout their generations.”

## Exodus 30:22
Moreover, the Lord spoke to Moses,

## Exodus 30:23
“Take the finest spices: 500 shekels of liquid myrrh, 250 shekels of fragrant cinnamon, 250 shekels of fragrant cane,

## Exodus 30:24
500 shekels of cassia, according to the sanctuary shekel, and a hin of olive oil.

## Exodus 30:25
Make these into a sacred anointing oil, a fragrant blend, the work of a perfumer; it shall be a holy anointing oil.

## Exodus 30:26
Use it to anoint the tent of meeting, the ark of the covenant,

## Exodus 30:27
the table and all its utensils, the lampstand and its accessories, and the altar of incense,

## Exodus 30:28
the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the basin with its stand.

## Exodus 30:29
Consecrate them so that they may be most holy; whatever touches them will be holy.

## Exodus 30:30
Anoint Aaron and his sons, consecrating them to serve as priests to Me.

## Exodus 30:31
Speak to the Israelites, saying, ‘This shall be My sacred anointing oil for generations to come.

## Exodus 30:32
It shall not be poured on anyone else’s body, nor shall you make any other oil using the same formula. It is sacred, and you must consider it sacred.

## Exodus 30:33
Whoever makes a perfume like it or puts it on anyone other than a priest must be cut off from their people.’”

## Exodus 30:34
Then the Lord said to Moses, “Take fragrant spices—stacte, onycha, galbanum, and pure frankincense—all in equal parts,

## Exodus 30:35
and make a fragrant blend of incense, a skilled mixture, the work of a perfumer. It is to be salted, pure, and holy.

## Exodus 30:36
Grind some of it to powder and place it in front of the ark of the covenant in the tent of meeting, where I will meet with you. It shall be most holy to you.

## Exodus 30:37
Do not make any incense with this formula for yourselves; consider it holy to the Lord.

## Exodus 30:38
Whoever makes incense like it to enjoy its fragrance must be cut off from their people.”
