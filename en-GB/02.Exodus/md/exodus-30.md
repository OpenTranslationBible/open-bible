# Exodus Chapter 30

## Exodus 30:1
“Make an altar of acacia wood for burning incense.

## Exodus 30:2
It is to be square—a cubit long and a cubit wide—and two cubits high, with horns of one piece with it.

## Exodus 30:3
Overlay it with pure gold—top, sides, and horns—and make a gold moulding around it.

## Exodus 30:4
Make two gold rings below the moulding—one on each side—to hold the poles used for carrying it.

## Exodus 30:5
Make the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold.

## Exodus 30:6
Put the altar in front of the curtain that shields the ark of the covenant law—before the atonement cover where I will meet with you.

## Exodus 30:7
Aaron must burn fragrant incense on it every morning when he tends the lamps.

## Exodus 30:8
He must also burn incense at twilight when he lights the lamps, so incense will burn continually before the Lord for generations to come.

## Exodus 30:9
Do not offer any other incense, burnt offering, grain offering, or pour out a drink offering on it.

## Exodus 30:10
Once a year Aaron shall make atonement on its horns. With the blood of the sin offering for atonement, he is to do this once a year for generations to come. It is most holy to the Lord.”

## Exodus 30:11
Then the Lord said to Moses,

## Exodus 30:12
“When you count the Israelites, each must pay a ransom for their life to the Lord. No plague will come on them when you count them.

## Exodus 30:13
Each person over twenty is to give half a shekel, according to the sanctuary standard.

## Exodus 30:14
All who are counted, from twenty years old and up, must give the offering to the Lord.

## Exodus 30:15
The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when giving the offering to the Lord to make atonement.

## Exodus 30:16
Receive the atonement money from the Israelites and use it for the service of the tent of meeting. It will be a memorial for the Israelites before the Lord, making atonement for your lives.”

## Exodus 30:17
Then the Lord said to Moses,

## Exodus 30:18
“Make a bronze basin with a bronze stand for washing. Place it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water in it.

## Exodus 30:19
Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and feet with water from it.

## Exodus 30:20
Whenever they go into the tent of meeting or approach the altar, they must wash with water so that they will not die.

## Exodus 30:21
They must wash their hands and feet so they will not die. This is a lasting ordinance for them and their descendants.”

## Exodus 30:22
Then the Lord said to Moses,

## Exodus 30:23
“Take the finest spices: liquid myrrh, fragrant cinnamon, fragrant cane, cassia—all measured according to the sanctuary standard—and a hin of olive oil.

## Exodus 30:24
Combine them to make a sacred anointing oil, blended by a perfumer.

## Exodus 30:25
Use it to anoint the tent of meeting, the ark of the covenant law,

## Exodus 30:26
the table and all its articles, the lampstand and its utensils, the altar of incense,

## Exodus 30:27
the altar of burnt offering and all its tools, and the basin with its stand.

## Exodus 30:28
You are to consecrate them so they will be most holy, and whatever touches them will be holy.

## Exodus 30:29
Anoint Aaron and his sons and consecrate them so they may serve Me as priests.

## Exodus 30:30
Say to the Israelites: This will be My sacred anointing oil for the generations to come.

## Exodus 30:31
Do not pour it on anyone else’s body, and do not make any other oil using the same formula. It is sacred, and you are to treat it as sacred.

## Exodus 30:32
Whoever makes oil like it or puts it on anyone other than a priest must be cut off from their people.”

## Exodus 30:33
Then the Lord said to Moses,

## Exodus 30:34
“Take fragrant spices—gum resin, onycha and galbanum—and pure frankincense, all in equal amounts,

## Exodus 30:35
and make a fragrant blend of incense, the work of a perfumer. It is to be salted and pure and sacred.

## Exodus 30:36
Grind some of it to powder and place it in front of the ark of the covenant law in the tent of meeting, where I will meet with you.

## Exodus 30:37
Treat the incense as most holy.

## Exodus 30:38
Do not make any incense with this formula for yourselves. Consider it holy to the Lord. Whoever makes incense like it for personal use must be cut off from their people.
