# Exodus Chapter 21

## Exodus 21:1
“These are the ordinances you shall set before them:

## Exodus 21:2
“If you acquire a Hebrew servant, he shall serve for six years; but in the seventh year, he shall be released as a free man, without any payment.

## Exodus 21:3
If he arrives alone, he shall depart alone; but if he is married, then his wife shall leave with him.

## Exodus 21:4
If his master provides him with a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall belong to her master, and he shall depart alone.

## Exodus 21:5
But if the servant declares, ‘I have affection for my master, my wife, and my children; I will not leave as a free man,’

## Exodus 21:6
then his master shall bring him before God. He shall bring him to the door or the doorpost and pierce his ear with an awl, and he shall serve him permanently.

## Exodus 21:7
“If a man sells his daughter as a maidservant, she shall not go free as male servants do.

## Exodus 21:8
If she does not please her master who has chosen her for himself, he must allow her to be redeemed. He has no authority to sell her to foreign people, due to his unfaithfulness to her.

## Exodus 21:9
If he designates her for his son, he must treat her according to the rights of daughters.

## Exodus 21:10
If he marries another woman, he must not diminish her food, clothing, or marital rights.

## Exodus 21:11
If he does not provide these three things for her, she shall go free without any payment.

## Exodus 21:12
“Anyone who strikes a person so that they die shall surely be put to death.

## Exodus 21:13
However, if it is not premeditated, but God allows it to happen, I will appoint a place for him to flee.

## Exodus 21:14
But if anyone acts with malice aforethought to kill his neighbour, you shall take him even from My altar to be put to death.

## Exodus 21:15
“Anyone who strikes their father or mother shall surely be put to death.

## Exodus 21:16
“Anyone who kidnaps a person, whether they have sold them or are still in possession, shall surely be put to death.

## Exodus 21:17
“Anyone who curses their father or mother shall surely be put to death.

## Exodus 21:18
“If people quarrel and one strikes the other with a stone or with their fist, and the victim does not die but is confined to bed,

## Exodus 21:19
if the injured party rises again and walks outside with a staff, then the assailant shall go unpunished; he must only compensate for the loss of time and ensure the victim is fully healed.

## Exodus 21:20
“If someone beats their male or female slave with a rod and the slave dies at their hand, they must be punished.

## Exodus 21:21
However, if the slave survives for a day or two, no vengeance shall be taken, for the slave is their property.

## Exodus 21:22
“If men struggle and strike a pregnant woman so that she gives birth prematurely, but there is no serious injury, the offender shall be fined whatever the woman's husband demands and the judges allow.

## Exodus 21:23
But if there is serious injury, you shall give life for life,

## Exodus 21:24
eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,

## Exodus 21:25
burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.

## Exodus 21:26
“If an owner strikes the eye of his male or female slave and destroys it, he must let the slave go free to compensate for the eye.

## Exodus 21:27
And if he knocks out the tooth of his male or female slave, he must let the slave go free to compensate for the tooth.

## Exodus 21:28
“If an ox gores a man or woman to death, the ox must be stoned, and its meat shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall not be held responsible.

## Exodus 21:29
If, however, the ox has been known to gore in the past and its owner has been warned but has not kept it confined, and it kills a man or woman, the ox shall be stoned and its owner also shall be put to death.

## Exodus 21:30
If a ransom is demanded, he may redeem his life by paying whatever is demanded.

## Exodus 21:31
This law applies if the ox gores a son or daughter.

## Exodus 21:32
If the ox gores a male or female slave, the owner must pay thirty shekels of silver to the master of the slave, and the ox shall be stoned.

## Exodus 21:33
“If someone opens a pit, or digs a pit and does not cover it, and an ox or a donkey falls into it,

## Exodus 21:34
the owner of the pit must make restitution; he shall give money to the owner of the animal, and the dead animal shall become his.

## Exodus 21:35
“If someone’s ox injures another’s ox so that it dies, they shall sell the live ox and divide the proceeds equally; they shall also divide the dead ox.

## Exodus 21:36
However, if it was known that the ox had the habit of goring, and its owner did not keep it confined, he must make restitution, ox for ox, and the dead animal shall become his.
