## Exodus 17:1
The entire community of the Israelites set out by stages from the wilderness of Sin, following the Lord's command, and encamped at Rephidim, where there was no water for the people to drink.

## Exodus 17:2
The people contended with Moses, demanding, “Give us water to drink.” Moses responded, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test the Lord?”

## Exodus 17:3
The people, thirsting for water, grumbled against Moses, saying, “Why did you bring us up from Egypt, to kill us and our children and livestock with thirst?”

Moses cried out to the Lord, “What shall I do with this people? They are almost ready to stone me!”

## Exodus 17:5
The Lord instructed Moses, “Pass before the people, take some of the elders of Israel with you, and take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go.

## Exodus 17:6
I will stand before you there on the rock at Horeb; strike the rock, and water will flow from it for the people to drink.” Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.
