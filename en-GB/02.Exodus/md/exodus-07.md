# Exodus Chapter 7

## Exodus 7:1

Then the Lord said to Moses, “See, I have made you as God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron will be your prophet.

## Exodus 7:2

You shall speak everything I command you, and your brother Aaron shall tell Pharaoh to let the Israelites depart from his land.

## Exodus 7:3

But I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, so that I may multiply My signs and wonders in Egypt.

## Exodus 7:4

Pharaoh will not listen to you, so I will lay My hand on Egypt and bring out My armies, My people the Israelites, by great acts of judgment.

## Exodus 7:5

The Egyptians will know that I am the Lord when I stretch out My hand over Egypt and bring the Israelites out from among them.”

## Exodus 7:6

Moses and Aaron carried out the Lord's instructions exactly as commanded.

## Exodus 7:7

Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron was eighty-three, when they spoke to Pharaoh.

## Exodus 7:8

The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,

## Exodus 7:9

“When Pharaoh says to you, ‘Perform a miracle,’ you shall say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh, and it will become a serpent.’”

## Exodus 7:10

So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did as the Lord commanded. Aaron threw his staff down before Pharaoh and his officials, and it became a serpent.

## Exodus 7:11

Pharaoh then summoned the wise men and sorcerers, and the Egyptian magicians did the same by their secret arts:

## Exodus 7:12

Each one threw down his staff, and they became serpents. But Aaron’s staff swallowed up their staffs.

## Exodus 7:13

However, Pharaoh’s heart remained unyielding, and he did not listen to them, just as the Lord had said.

## Exodus 7:14

Then the Lord said to Moses, “Pharaoh’s heart is stubborn and hard; he refuses to let the people go.

## Exodus 7:15

Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he goes out to the water. Stand on the bank of the Nile to meet him, and take in your hand the staff that was turned into a serpent.

## Exodus 7:16

Say to him, ‘The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to say to you: Let My people go, so that they may worship Me in the wilderness. But you have not listened until now.

## Exodus 7:17

This is what the Lord says: By this you shall know that I am the Lord: I will strike the water of the Nile with the staff in my hand, and it will be turned into blood.

## Exodus 7:18

The fish in the Nile will die, the river will stink, and the Egyptians will not be able to drink the water from the Nile.’”

## Exodus 7:19

The Lord said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt—over their rivers, streams, ponds, and all their reservoirs—and they will turn to blood. There will be blood throughout all Egypt, even in vessels of wood and stone.’”

## Exodus 7:20

Moses and Aaron did just as the Lord commanded. He lifted the staff and struck the water of the Nile in the sight of Pharaoh and his officials, and all the water in the Nile was turned into blood.

## Exodus 7:21

The fish in the Nile died, and the river stank so that the Egyptians could not drink the water from the Nile. Blood was everywhere in Egypt.

## Exodus 7:22

But the Egyptian magicians did the same by their secret arts, and Pharaoh’s heart was hardened; he did not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the Lord had said.

## Exodus 7:23

Pharaoh turned and went into his palace, and did not take even this to heart.

## Exodus 7:24

All the Egyptians dug along the Nile for water to drink, because they could not drink the water of the river.

## Exodus 7:25

Seven days passed after the Lord had struck the Nile.
