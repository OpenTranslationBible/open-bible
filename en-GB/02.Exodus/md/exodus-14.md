# Exodus Chapter 14

## Exodus 14:1
Now the Lord spoke to Moses,

## Exodus 14:2
“Tell the Israelites to turn back and camp near Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea; you shall camp opposite Baal-zephon, by the sea.

## Exodus 14:3
For Pharaoh will say of the Israelites, ‘They are wandering aimlessly in the land; the wilderness has shut them in.’

## Exodus 14:4
And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and he will pursue them; and I will gain glory for myself through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord.” And they did so.

## Exodus 14:5
When the king of Egypt was informed that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his officials had a change of heart about them, and said, “What have we done? We have let the Israelites go and lost their services!”

## Exodus 14:6
So he had his chariot prepared and took his people with him.

## Exodus 14:7
He took six hundred of the best chariots, along with all the other chariots of Egypt, with officers over all of them.

## Exodus 14:8
The Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, so that he pursued the Israelites, who were marching out boldly.

## Exodus 14:9
The Egyptians pursued them with all Pharaoh’s horses and chariots, his horsemen and troops, and overtook them as they camped by the sea, near Pi-hahiroth, opposite Baal-zephon.

## Exodus 14:10
As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up and saw the Egyptians marching after them, and they were terrified and cried out to the Lord.

## Exodus 14:11
They said to Moses, “Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you have brought us to the wilderness to die? What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt?

## Exodus 14:12
Did we not say to you in Egypt, ‘Leave us alone so that we may serve the Egyptians’? It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness!”

## Exodus 14:13
But Moses said to the people, “Do not be afraid. Stand firm and you will see the deliverance the Lord will bring you today; the Egyptians you see today you will never see again.

## Exodus 14:14
The Lord will fight for you; you need only to be silent.”

## Exodus 14:15
Then the Lord said to Moses, “Why are you crying out to me? Tell the Israelites to move forward.

## Exodus 14:16
Raise your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea to divide the water, so that the Israelites can go through the sea on dry ground.

## Exodus 14:17
I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in after them. And I will gain glory through Pharaoh and all his army, through his chariots and his horsemen.

## Exodus 14:18
The Egyptians will know that I am the Lord when I gain glory through Pharaoh, his chariots and his horsemen.”

## Exodus 14:19
Then the angel of God, who had been travelling in front of Israel’s army, moved and went behind them; the pillar of cloud also moved from in front and stood behind them,

## Exodus 14:20
coming between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel. Throughout the night the cloud brought darkness to one side and light to the other; so neither went near the other all night long.

## Exodus 14:21
Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and all that night the Lord drove the sea back with a strong east wind and turned it into dry land. The waters were divided,

## Exodus 14:22
and the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with a wall of water on their right and on their left.

## Exodus 14:23
The Egyptians pursued them, and all Pharaoh’s horses, chariots and horsemen followed them into the sea.

## Exodus 14:24
During the last watch of the night, the Lord looked down from the pillar of fire and cloud at the Egyptian army and threw it into confusion.

## Exodus 14:25
He jammed the wheels of their chariots so that they had difficulty driving. And the Egyptians said, “Let us flee from the Israelites! The Lord is fighting for them against Egypt.”

## Exodus 14:26
Then the Lord said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the sea so that the waters may flow back over the Egyptians, their chariots and horsemen.”

## Exodus 14:27
So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at daybreak the sea returned to its place. The Egyptians were fleeing towards it, and the Lord swept them into the sea.

## Exodus 14:28
The water flowed back and covered the chariots and horsemen—the entire army of Pharaoh that had followed the Israelites into the sea. Not one of them survived.

## Exodus 14:29
But the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with a wall of water on their right and on their left.

## Exodus 14:30
That day the Lord saved Israel from the hands of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians lying dead on the shore.

## Exodus 14:31
When the Israelites saw the mighty hand of the Lord displayed against the Egyptians, the people feared the Lord and put their trust in him and in Moses his servant.
