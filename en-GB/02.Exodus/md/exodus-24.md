Moses, along with Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and the seventy elders of Israel, ascended.

Moses ascended the mountain, and the cloud enveloped it.

To the Israelites, the glory of the Lord appeared like a consuming fire atop the mountain.

## Exodus 24:18
Moses entered the cloud as he ascended the mountain, and he remained on the mountain for forty days and forty nights.
