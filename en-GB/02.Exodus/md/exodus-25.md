## Exodus 25:1
The Lord said to Moses,

## Exodus 25:2
“Tell the Israelites to bring Me an offering. You are to receive the offering from everyone whose heart prompts them to give.

## Exodus 25:3
These are the offerings you are to receive from them: gold, silver and bronze;

## Exodus 25:4
blue, purple and scarlet yarn and fine linen; goat hair;

## Exodus 25:5
ram skins dyed red and durable leather; acacia wood;

## Exodus 25:6
olive oil for the light; spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense;

## Exodus 25:7
and onyx stones and other gems to be mounted on the ephod and breastpiece.

## Exodus 25:8
“Then have them make a sanctuary for Me, and I will dwell among them.

## Exodus 25:9
Make this tabernacle and all its furnishings exactly like the pattern I will show you.

## Exodus 25:10
“Have them make an ark of acacia wood—two and a half cubits long, one and a half cubits wide, and one and a half cubits high.

## Exodus 25:11
Overlay it with pure gold, both inside and out, and make a gold moulding around it.

## Exodus 25:12
Cast four gold rings for it and fasten them to its four feet, two rings on one side and two on the other.

## Exodus 25:13
Then make poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold.

## Exodus 25:14
Insert the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark to carry it.

## Exodus 25:15
The poles are to remain in the rings of this ark; they are not to be removed.

## Exodus 25:16
Then put in the ark the tablets of the covenant law, which I will give you.

## Exodus 25:17
“Make an atonement cover of pure gold—two and a half cubits long and one and a half cubits wide.

## Exodus 25:18
Make two cherubim out of hammered gold at the ends of the cover.

## Exodus 25:19
Make one cherub on one end and the second cherub on the other; make the cherubim of one piece with the cover, at the two ends.

## Exodus 25:20
The cherubim are to have their wings spread upward, overshadowing the cover with them. The cherubim are to face each other, looking toward the cover.

## Exodus 25:21
Place the cover on top of the ark and put in the ark the tablets of the covenant law that I will give you.

## Exodus 25:22
There, above the cover between the two cherubim that are over the ark of the covenant law, I will meet with you and give you all My commands for the Israelites.

## Exodus 25:23
“Make a table of acacia wood—two cubits long, one cubit wide and one and a half cubits high.

## Exodus 25:24
Overlay it with pure gold and make a gold moulding around it.

## Exodus 25:25
Also make around it a rim a handbreadth wide and put a gold moulding on the rim.

## Exodus 25:26
Make four gold rings for the table and fasten them to the four corners, where the four legs are.

## Exodus 25:27
The rings are to be close to the rim to hold the poles used in carrying the table.

## Exodus 25:28
Make the poles of acacia wood, overlay them with gold, and carry the table with them.

## Exodus 25:29
Make its plates and dishes of pure gold, as well as its pitchers and bowls for the pouring of offerings.

## Exodus 25:30
Put the bread of the Presence on this table to be before Me at all times.

## Exodus 25:31
“Make a lampstand of pure gold. Hammer out its base and shaft, and make its flowerlike cups, buds and blossoms of one piece with them.

## Exodus 25:32
Six branches are to extend from the sides of the lampstand—three on one side and three on the other.

## Exodus 25:33
Three cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms are to be on one branch, three on the next branch—and the same for all six branches extending from the lampstand.

## Exodus 25:34
And on the lampstand there are to be four cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms.

## Exodus 25:35
One bud shall be under the first pair of branches, a second under the second pair, and a third under the third pair—six branches in all.

## Exodus 25:36
The buds and branches shall all be of one piece with the lampstand, hammered out of pure gold.

## Exodus 25:37
Then make its seven lamps and set them up so that they light the area in front of it.

## Exodus 25:38
Its wick trimmers and trays are to be of pure gold.

## Exodus 25:39
A talent of pure gold is to be used for the lampstand and all these accessories.

## Exodus 25:40
See that you make them according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.
