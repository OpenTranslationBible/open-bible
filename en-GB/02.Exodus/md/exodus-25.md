“They shall make an ark of acacia wood—two and a half cubits long, a cubit and a half wide, and a cubit and a half high.

## Exodus 25:11
Overlay it with pure gold, inside and out, and make a gold moulding around it.

## Exodus 25:21
Place the cover on top of the ark and put in the ark the tablets of the covenant law that I will give you.

There, above the cover between the two cherubim that are over the ark of the covenant law, I will meet with you and give you all my commands for the Israelites.

“Create a lampstand of pure gold. The lampstand, its base and its shaft, are to be made of hammered work; its flowerlike cups, buds, and blossoms shall be of one piece with it.

## Exodus 25:32
Six branches are to extend from its sides—three on one side and three on the other.

## Exodus 25:33
Three cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms are to be on one branch, three on the next branch, and the same for all six branches extending from the lampstand.

## Exodus 25:34
And on the lampstand there are to be four cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms.

## Exodus 25:35
One bud shall be under the first pair of branches extending from the lampstand, a second bud under the second pair, and a third bud under the third pair—six branches in all.

The buds and branches shall all be of one piece with the lampstand, crafted from pure gold.

## Exodus 25:37
