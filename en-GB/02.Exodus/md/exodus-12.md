# Exodus Chapter 12

## Exodus 12:1

The Lord addressed Moses and Aaron while they were in the land of Egypt,

## Exodus 12:2

“This month shall mark the start of months for you; it is to be the first month of the year for you.

## Exodus 12:3

Speak to all the congregation of Israel, saying, ‘On the tenth of this month, each one is to take a lamb for themselves, according to their fathers’ households, a lamb for each household.

## Exodus 12:4

Now if the household is too small for a lamb, then he and his nearest neighbour are to take one according to the number of people in them; you are to divide the lamb according to what each person will eat.

## Exodus 12:5

Your lamb shall be a flawless male a year old; you may take it from the sheep or from the goats.

## Exodus 12:6

And you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month; then the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel is to slaughter it at twilight.

## Exodus 12:7

Furthermore, they shall take some of the blood and apply it on the two doorposts and on the lintel of the houses in which they eat it.

## Exodus 12:8

They shall consume the flesh that same night, roasted with fire, and they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.

## Exodus 12:9

Do not eat any of it raw or boiled in water, but roasted with fire—its head and its legs along with its entrails.

## Exodus 12:10

And you shall not leave any of it until morning, but whatever remains until morning, you shall burn with fire.

## Exodus 12:11

Now you shall eat it in this way: with your belt fastened, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand. You shall eat it in a hurry—it is the Lord’s Passover.

## Exodus 12:12

For I will go through the land of Egypt on that night, and will strike down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and animal; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments—I am the Lord.

## Exodus 12:13

The blood shall serve as a sign for you on the houses where you live; and when I see the blood I will pass over you, and no plague will come upon you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.

## Exodus 12:14

This day shall be a memorial to you, and you shall celebrate it as a feast to the Lord; throughout your generations you are to observe it as a lasting ordinance.

## Exodus 12:15

For seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, but on the first day you shall remove leaven from your houses; for whoever eats anything leavened from the first day until the seventh day, that person shall be cut off from Israel.

## Exodus 12:16

On the first day you shall have a holy assembly, and another holy assembly on the seventh day; no work at all shall be done on them, except what must be eaten by every person—that alone may be prepared by you.

## Exodus 12:17

You are also to celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread, for on this very day I brought your multitudes out of the land of Egypt; therefore you shall celebrate this day throughout your generations as a permanent ordinance.

## Exodus 12:18

From the evening of the fourteenth day of the first month, you shall eat unleavened bread until the evening of the twenty-first day of the month.

## Exodus 12:19

For seven days there shall be no leaven found in your houses; for whoever eats what is leavened, that person shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether they are a stranger or a native of the land.

## Exodus 12:20

You must avoid eating anything leavened; in all your dwellings, you shall eat unleavened bread.

## Exodus 12:21

Then Moses summoned all the elders of Israel and instructed them, “Go and select lambs for yourselves according to your families, and sacrifice the Passover lamb.

## Exodus 12:22

And you shall take a bunch of hyssop, dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and apply some of the blood that is in the basin to the lintel and the two doorposts; and none of you shall go outside the door of his house until morning.

## Exodus 12:23

For the Lord will pass through to strike the Egyptians; but when He sees the blood on the lintel and on the two doorposts, the Lord will pass over the door and will not allow the destroyer to come into your houses to strike you.

## Exodus 12:24

And you shall observe this event as a statute for you and your children for all time.

## Exodus 12:25

When you enter the land which the Lord will give you, as He has promised, you shall maintain this rite.

## Exodus 12:26

And when your children say to you, ‘What does this rite mean to you?’

## Exodus 12:27

Then you shall say, ‘It is a Passover sacrifice to the Lord because He passed over the houses of the sons of Israel in Egypt when He struck the Egyptians, but spared our homes.’” And the people bowed low and worshipped.

## Exodus 12:28

Then the sons of Israel went and did just as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron, they did as they were commanded.

## Exodus 12:29

And so, around midnight, the Lord struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt. From the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of cattle.

## Exodus 12:30

Then Pharaoh got up in the night, he and all his servants and all the Egyptians, and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was no home where there was not someone dead.

## Exodus 12:31

And he called for Moses and Aaron at night and said, “Get up, go away from my people, both you and the sons of Israel; and go, serve the Lord, as you have said.

## Exodus 12:32

Take both your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and go, and also bless me.”

## Exodus 12:33

The Egyptians urged the people, to send them out of the land in haste, for they said, “We shall all perish!”

## Exodus 12:34

So the people took their dough before it was leavened, carrying their kneading bowls wrapped in their clothing on their shoulders.

## Exodus 12:35

Now the sons of Israel had done according to the word of Moses, for they had requested from the Egyptians articles of silver and gold, and clothing;

## Exodus 12:36

and the Lord had given the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have what they requested. So they plundered the Egyptians.

## Exodus 12:37

The sons of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, aside from children.

## Exodus 12:38

A mixed multitude also went up with them, along with flocks and herds, a very large number of livestock.

## Exodus 12:39

And they baked the dough which they had brought out of Egypt into cakes of unleavened bread. For it had not become leavened, since they were driven out of Egypt and could not delay, nor had they prepared any provisions for themselves.

## Exodus 12:40

Now the time that the sons of Israel had lived in Egypt was 430 years.

## Exodus 12:41

And at the end of 430 years, on this very same day, all the multitudes of the Lord departed from the land of Egypt.

## Exodus 12:42

It is a night to be observed for the Lord for having brought them out from the land of Egypt; this night is for the Lord, to be observed by all the sons of Israel throughout their generations.

## Exodus 12:43

And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, “This is the ordinance of the Passover: no foreigner is to eat it;

## Exodus 12:44

but as for every slave that someone has purchased with money, after you have circumcised him, then he may eat it.

## Exodus 12:45

A visitor or a hired worker shall not partake of it.

## Exodus 12:46

It is to be eaten in a single house; you are not to take any of the meat outside of the house, nor are you to break any bone of it.

## Exodus 12:47

All the congregation of Israel are to celebrate this.

## Exodus 12:48

But if a stranger resides with you and celebrates the Passover to the Lord, all his males are to be circumcised, and then he may come near to celebrate it; and he shall be like a native of the land. But no uncircumcised person may eat it.

## Exodus 12:49

The same law shall apply to the native as to the stranger who resides among you.”

## Exodus 12:50

Then all the sons of Israel did as they were commanded; they did just as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron.

## Exodus 12:51

And on that very same day, the Lord brought the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their multitudes.
