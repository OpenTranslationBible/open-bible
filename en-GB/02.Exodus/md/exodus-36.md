# Exodus Chapter 36

## Exodus 36:1
Bezalel, Oholiab, and every skilled person to whom the Lord had given ability were to carry out the work of building the sanctuary, doing everything the Lord had commanded.

## Exodus 36:2
Moses summoned Bezalel and Oholiab and every skilled person whose heart was moved to come and do the work.

## Exodus 36:3
They received from Moses all the contributions the Israelites had brought. The people kept bringing more gifts morning after morning.

## Exodus 36:4
So all the skilled workers left the work they were doing

## Exodus 36:5
and said to Moses, “The people are bringing more than enough for the work the Lord commanded us to do.”

## Exodus 36:6
Then Moses sent out an order through the camp: “No man or woman is to bring anything else for the offering for the sanctuary.” So the people were restrained from bringing more.

## Exodus 36:7
Because what had already been given was more than enough to do all the work.

## Exodus 36:8
All the skilled workers among the people made the tabernacle out of ten curtains of finely twisted linen, with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, embroidered with cherubim.

## Exodus 36:9
Each curtain was the same size: twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide.

## Exodus 36:10
They joined five curtains together into one set, and the other five into another.

## Exodus 36:11
They made loops of blue fabric on the edge of the end curtain of each set.

## Exodus 36:12
There were fifty loops on one curtain and fifty loops on the corresponding curtain of the other set.

## Exodus 36:13
They made fifty gold clasps and joined the two sets of curtains together, so the tabernacle became one.

## Exodus 36:14
They made eleven curtains of goat hair to cover the tabernacle as a tent.

## Exodus 36:15
Each curtain was thirty cubits long and four cubits wide.

## Exodus 36:16
They joined five of the curtains into one set and six into another.

## Exodus 36:17
They made fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in each set.

## Exodus 36:18
Then they made fifty bronze clasps to join the tent together.

## Exodus 36:19
They made a covering for the tent from ram skins dyed red, and an outer covering of durable leather.

## Exodus 36:20
They made upright frames of acacia wood for the tabernacle.

## Exodus 36:21
Each frame was ten cubits high and one and a half cubits wide.

## Exodus 36:22
Each frame had two tenons, joined to each other.

## Exodus 36:23
They made twenty frames for the south side of the tabernacle

## Exodus 36:24
with forty silver bases to go under them—two bases for each frame.

## Exodus 36:25
For the north side, they made twenty frames

## Exodus 36:26
with forty silver bases—two under each frame.

## Exodus 36:27
For the west end, they made six frames

## Exodus 36:28
and two frames for the corners at the rear of the tabernacle.

## Exodus 36:29
These corner frames were joined at both the bottom and top by a single ring.

## Exodus 36:30
So there were eight frames and sixteen silver bases—two under each frame.

## Exodus 36:31
They made crossbars of acacia wood: five for the frames on one side,

## Exodus 36:32
five for the frames on the other side, and five for the west end.

## Exodus 36:33
They made the centre crossbar run from end to end halfway up the frames.

## Exodus 36:34
They overlaid the frames with gold and made gold rings to hold the crossbars. The crossbars were also overlaid with gold.

## Exodus 36:35
They made the curtain of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen, with cherubim woven into it by a skilled worker.

## Exodus 36:36
They made four posts of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold. Their hooks were gold, and they cast four silver bases for them.

## Exodus 36:37
For the entrance to the tent, they made a curtain of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen—the work of an embroiderer.

## Exodus 36:38
They made five posts with hooks for it. They overlaid the tops and bands with gold and made five bronze bases.
