# Exodus Chapter 36

## Exodus 36:1
Bezalel, Oholiab, and every skilled individual to whom the Lord has imparted wisdom and understanding to execute all the work for constructing the sanctuary, shall carry out the work in accordance with all that the Lord has commanded.

## Exodus 36:2
Moses then called Bezalel, Oholiab, and every skilled person to whom the Lord had given ability, everyone whose heart was moved to come forward and engage in the work.

## Exodus 36:3
They received from Moses all the contributions the Israelites had brought for the work on the sanctuary. And the people continued to bring freewill offerings every morning.

## Exodus 36:4
All the skilled workers engaged in the work of the sanctuary left their tasks

## Exodus 36:5
and reported to Moses, “The people are bringing far more than is needed for the work the Lord has commanded us to do.”

## Exodus 36:6
So Moses issued a command and sent a proclamation throughout the camp: “No man or woman is to make any further offerings for the sanctuary.” Thus, the people were restrained from bringing more.

## Exodus 36:7
For the materials they had were sufficient and even more than enough to complete all the work.

## Exodus 36:8
All the skilled artisans among the workers made the tabernacle with ten curtains of finely twisted linen and blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, with cherubim woven into them by a skilled craftsman.

## Exodus 36:9
Each curtain was twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide; all the curtains were of the same size.

## Exodus 36:10
They joined five of the curtains together, and the other five were similarly joined.

## Exodus 36:11
They made loops of blue material along the edge of the end curtain in one set, and the same was done with the end curtain in the other set.

## Exodus 36:12
Fifty loops were made on one curtain and fifty on the edge of the curtain in the other set, with the loops aligned opposite each other.

## Exodus 36:13
They also made fifty gold clasps and used them to join the two sets of curtains so that the tabernacle formed a single unit.

## Exodus 36:14
They made curtains of goat hair for the tent over the tabernacle, eleven in total.

## Exodus 36:15
Each of the eleven curtains was thirty cubits long and four cubits wide, all of them having the same dimensions.

## Exodus 36:16
They joined five of the curtains into one set and the remaining six into another set.

## Exodus 36:17
They made fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in one set and fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in the other set.

## Exodus 36:18
Fifty bronze clasps were made to join the tent together as a single unit.

## Exodus 36:19
They made a covering for the tent of ram skins dyed red, and over that a covering of another durable leather.

## Exodus 36:20
They constructed upright frames of acacia wood for the tabernacle.

## Exodus 36:21
Each frame was ten cubits long and a cubit and a half wide,

## Exodus 36:22
with two tenons parallel to each other. All the frames of the tabernacle were made in this manner.

## Exodus 36:23
They made twenty frames for the south side of the tabernacle

## Exodus 36:24
and forty silver bases to go under them—two bases for each frame, one under each tenon.

## Exodus 36:25
For the north side of the tabernacle, they made twenty frames

## Exodus 36:26
and forty silver bases—two under each frame.

## Exodus 36:27
They made six frames for the west end of the tabernacle,

## Exodus 36:28
and two frames were made for the corners of the tabernacle at the far end.

## Exodus 36:29
These frames were double from the bottom to the top and fitted into a single ring; both were made alike.

## Exodus 36:30
Thus, there were eight frames and sixteen silver bases—two under each frame.

## Exodus 36:31
They also made crossbars of acacia wood: five for the frames on one side of the tabernacle,

## Exodus 36:32
five for those on the other side, and five for the frames at the west end of the tabernacle.

## Exodus 36:33
The centre crossbar was made to extend from end to end at the middle of the frames.

## Exodus 36:34
They overlaid the frames with gold and made gold rings to hold the crossbars, which were also overlaid with gold.

## Exodus 36:35
They crafted the veil of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen, with cherubim woven into it by a skilled craftsman.

## Exodus 36:36
Four posts of acacia wood were made for it, overlaid with gold, with gold hooks, and four silver bases were cast for them.

## Exodus 36:37
For the entrance to the tent, they made a curtain of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen, the work of an embroiderer;

## Exodus 36:38
and they made five posts with hooks for it. The tops of the posts and their bands were overlaid with gold, and their five bases were made of bronze.
