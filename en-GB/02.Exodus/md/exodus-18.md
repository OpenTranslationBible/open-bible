# Exodus Chapter 18

## Exodus 18:1
Now Jethro, the priest of Midian and Moses’ father-in-law, heard about all that God had done for Moses and for His people Israel, and how the Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt.

## Exodus 18:2
Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, had taken in Moses’ wife Zipporah, after Moses had sent her away,

## Exodus 18:3
along with her two sons. One was named Gershom, for Moses had said, “I have been a stranger in a foreign land.”

## Exodus 18:4
The other was named Eliezer, for he had said, “The God of my father was my help and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.”

## Exodus 18:5
Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, came with Moses’ sons and wife to him in the wilderness, where he was camped at the mountain of God.

## Exodus 18:6
And he sent a message to Moses: “I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons.”

## Exodus 18:7
Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, bowed down, and kissed him. They asked each other about their welfare and then went into the tent.

## Exodus 18:8
Moses recounted to his father-in-law all that the Lord had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, all the hardships they had faced on their journey, and how the Lord had delivered them.

## Exodus 18:9
Jethro rejoiced over all the good things the Lord had done for Israel in rescuing them from the hand of the Egyptians.

## Exodus 18:10
Jethro said, “Blessed be the Lord, who has rescued you from the hand of the Egyptians and from Pharaoh, and who has delivered the people from the hand of the Egyptians.

## Exodus 18:11
Now I know that the Lord is greater than all other gods, for He has shown this when they acted arrogantly against the people.”

## Exodus 18:12
Then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, offered a burnt offering and sacrifices to God, and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat a meal with Moses’ father-in-law in the presence of God.

## Exodus 18:13
The following day, Moses sat to judge the people, and they stood around him from morning until evening.

## Exodus 18:14
When Moses’ father-in-law saw all that he was doing for the people, he asked, “What is this that you are doing for the people? Why do you sit alone as judge while all the people stand around you from morning till evening?”

## Exodus 18:15
Moses replied to his father-in-law, “Because the people come to me to seek God’s will.

## Exodus 18:16
When they have a dispute, it is brought to me, and I judge between the parties and make known God’s decrees and laws.”

## Exodus 18:17
Moses’ father-in-law said to him, “What you are doing is not good.

## Exodus 18:18
You and these people who come to you will only wear yourselves out. The task is too heavy for you; you cannot do it alone.

## Exodus 18:19
Now listen to me: I will give you advice, and may God be with you. You must be the people’s representative before God and bring their disputes to Him.

## Exodus 18:20
Teach them His decrees and instructions, and show them the way they are to live and the work they are to do.

## Exodus 18:21
Select capable men from among the people—men who fear God, trustworthy men who hate dishonest gain—and appoint them as leaders over thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens.

## Exodus 18:22
Let them serve as judges for the people at all times, but bring every difficult case to you; they can decide the simple cases themselves. This will lighten your load, as they will share it with you.

## Exodus 18:23
If you do this and God so commands, you will be able to endure, and all these people will go home satisfied.”

## Exodus 18:24
Moses listened to his father-in-law and did everything he suggested.

## Exodus 18:25
He chose capable men from all Israel and made them leaders of the people, officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens.

## Exodus 18:26
They judged the people at all times. They brought the difficult cases to Moses, but decided the simple ones themselves.

## Exodus 18:27
Then Moses bade farewell to his father-in-law, and Jethro went back to his own land.
