# Exodus Chapter 3

## Exodus 3:1

Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian. He led the flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.

## Exodus 3:2

There the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a blazing fire from within a bush. Moses saw that the bush was on fire but it was not consumed.

## Exodus 3:3

So Moses thought, “I will turn aside and see this remarkable sight—why the bush does not burn up.”

## Exodus 3:4

When the Lord saw that he had turned aside to look, God called to him from within the bush, “Moses, Moses!” And Moses replied, “Here I am.”

## Exodus 3:5

“Do not come any closer,” God instructed. “Remove your sandals, for the place where you are standing is sacred ground.”

## Exodus 3:6

Then He said, “I am the God of your father—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” At this, Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.

## Exodus 3:7

The Lord said, “I have surely seen the affliction of My people in Egypt and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters, for I am aware of their sufferings.

## Exodus 3:8

So I have come down to deliver them from the power of the Egyptians and to bring them up from that land to a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey—the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.

## Exodus 3:9

And now, behold, the cry of the Israelites has reached me, and I have seen how the Egyptians are oppressing them.

## Exodus 3:10

So go now: I am commissioning you to Pharaoh to lead My people, the Israelites, out of Egypt.”

## Exodus 3:11

But Moses asked God, “Who am I to approach Pharaoh and lead the Israelites out of Egypt?”

## Exodus 3:12

And God said, “Certainly I will be with you. And this will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall worship God on this mountain.”

## Exodus 3:13

Then Moses said to God, “Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is His name?’ What shall I say to them?”

## Exodus 3:14

God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to tell the Israelites: ‘I AM has sent me to you.’”

## Exodus 3:15

God also said to Moses, “Tell the Israelites, ‘The Lord, the God of your ancestors—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob—has sent me to you.’ This is My name forever, the name by which I am to be remembered from generation to generation.

## Exodus 3:16

“Go, gather the elders of Israel and say to them, ‘The Lord, the God of your ancestors—the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—appeared to me and said: I have watched over you and have seen what has been done to you in Egypt.

## Exodus 3:17

And I have promised to bring you up out of your affliction in Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites—a land flowing with milk and honey.’

## Exodus 3:18

“The elders of Israel will heed you. Then you and the elders are to go to the king of Egypt and say to him, ‘The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, has encountered us. Let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the Lord our God.’

## Exodus 3:19

But I am aware that the king of Egypt will not permit you to leave unless compelled by a powerful hand.

## Exodus 3:20

So I will extend My hand and strike Egypt with all My wonders which I will perform in their midst. After that, he will let you go.

## Exodus 3:21

“And I will cause the Egyptians to look favourably upon this people, so that when you leave you will not go empty-handed.

## Exodus 3:22

Every woman is to request from her neighbour and any woman living in her house for articles of silver and gold and for clothing, which you will put on your sons and daughters. In this way, you will take the wealth of the Egyptians.”
