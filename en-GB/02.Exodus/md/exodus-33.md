# Exodus Chapter 33

## Exodus 33:1
Then the Lord said to Moses, “Leave this place, you and the people you brought up out of Egypt, and go to the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, saying, ‘I will give it to your descendants.’

## Exodus 33:2
I will send an angel ahead of you and drive out the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.

## Exodus 33:3
Go up to the land flowing with milk and honey. But I will not go with you, because you are a stiff-necked people and I might destroy you on the way.”

## Exodus 33:4
When the people heard these distressing words, they began to mourn, and no one put on any ornaments.

## Exodus 33:5
For the Lord had said to Moses, “Tell the Israelites, ‘You are a stiff-necked people. If I were to go with you even for a moment, I might destroy you. Now take off your ornaments and I will decide what to do with you.’”

## Exodus 33:6
So the Israelites stripped off their ornaments at Mount Horeb.

## Exodus 33:7
Now Moses used to take a tent and pitch it some distance outside the camp. He called it the Tent of Meeting. Anyone who wanted to inquire of the Lord would go to the tent outside the camp.

## Exodus 33:8
Whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people rose and stood at the entrances to their own tents, watching him until he entered.

## Exodus 33:9
As Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would come down and stay at the entrance while the Lord spoke with Moses.

## Exodus 33:10
Whenever the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance to the tent, they all stood and worshiped, each at their own tent entrance.

## Exodus 33:11
The Lord would speak to Moses face to face, as one speaks to a friend. Then Moses would return to the camp, but his young aide Joshua son of Nun did not leave the tent.

## Exodus 33:12
Moses said to the Lord, “You have been telling me, ‘Lead these people,’ but You have not let me know whom You will send with me. You have said, ‘I know you by name and you have found favour with Me.’

## Exodus 33:13
If You are pleased with me, teach me Your ways so I may know You and continue to find favour with You. Remember that this nation is Your people.”

## Exodus 33:14
The Lord replied, “My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.”

## Exodus 33:15
Then Moses said to Him, “If Your Presence does not go with us, do not send us up from here.

## Exodus 33:16
How will anyone know that You are pleased with me and with Your people unless You go with us? What else will distinguish me and Your people from all the other people on the face of the earth?”

## Exodus 33:17
And the Lord said to Moses, “I will do the very thing you have asked, because I am pleased with you and I know you by name.”

## Exodus 33:18
Then Moses said, “Now show me Your glory.”

## Exodus 33:19
And the Lord said, “I will cause all My goodness to pass in front of you, and I will proclaim My name, the Lord, in your presence. I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and compassion on whom I have compassion.

## Exodus 33:20
But,” He said, “you cannot see My face, for no one may see Me and live.”

## Exodus 33:21
Then the Lord said, “There is a place near Me where you may stand on a rock.

## Exodus 33:22
When My glory passes by, I will put you in a cleft in the rock and cover you with My hand until I have passed by.

## Exodus 33:23
Then I will remove My hand and you will see My back; but My face must not be seen.”
