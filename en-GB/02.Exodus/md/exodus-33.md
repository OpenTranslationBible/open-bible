# Exodus Chapter 33

## Exodus 33:1
Then the Lord instructed Moses, “Depart from here, you and the people you have brought up from Egypt, and proceed to the land I vowed to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, ‘I will grant it to your descendants.’

## Exodus 33:2
I shall send an angel ahead of you and will expel the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.

## Exodus 33:3
Ascend to a land flowing with milk and honey; however, I will not accompany you, for you are a stubborn people, and I might annihilate you on the journey.”

## Exodus 33:4
Upon hearing these unsettling words, the people mourned, and none adorned themselves with jewellery.

## Exodus 33:5
For the Lord had instructed Moses, “Tell the Israelites, ‘You are a stubborn people. If I were to accompany you for even a moment, I might destroy you. Therefore, remove your jewellery so that I may determine what to do with you.’”

## Exodus 33:6
Thus, the Israelites divested themselves of their jewellery from Mount Horeb onwards.

## Exodus 33:7
Moses would take a tent and pitch it outside the camp, at some distance, and he called it the “tent of meeting.” Anyone seeking the Lord would go out to the tent of meeting, which was outside the camp.

## Exodus 33:8
Whenever Moses proceeded to the tent, all the people would rise and stand at the entrances of their tents, watching Moses until he entered the tent.

## Exodus 33:9
As Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and remain at the entrance, and the Lord would converse with Moses.

## Exodus 33:10
When the people observed the pillar of cloud standing at the tent's entrance, they would all stand and worship, each at the entrance of their tent.

## Exodus 33:11
The Lord would speak to Moses face to face, as one speaks to a friend. Then Moses would return to the camp, but his young assistant Joshua, son of Nun, would not depart from the tent.

## Exodus 33:12
Moses said to the Lord, “You have been instructing me, ‘Lead these people,’ but You have not revealed whom You will send with me. You have said, ‘I know you by name and you have found favour with me.’

## Exodus 33:13
If I have indeed found favour in Your sight, teach me Your ways so that I may know You and continue to find favour with You. Remember that this nation is Your people.”

## Exodus 33:14
The Lord responded, “My presence will go with you, and I will grant you rest.”

## Exodus 33:15
Moses replied, “If Your presence does not accompany us, do not make us leave this place.

## Exodus 33:16
For how will it be known that I have found favour in Your sight, I and Your people, unless You accompany us? What else will distinguish me and Your people from all other peoples on the earth?”

## Exodus 33:17
The Lord said to Moses, “I will also do this thing you have requested, for you have found favour in My sight, and I know you by name.”

## Exodus 33:18
Then Moses said, “Please, show me Your glory.”

## Exodus 33:19
And the Lord said, “I will cause all My goodness to pass before you, and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before you. I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show compassion to whom I will show compassion.”

## Exodus 33:20
But He said, “You cannot see My face, for no one may see Me and live.”

## Exodus 33:21
Then the Lord said, “There is a place near Me where you may stand on a rock.

## Exodus 33:22
When My glory passes by, I will place you in a cleft in the rock and cover you with My hand until I have passed by.

## Exodus 33:23
Then I will remove My hand and you shall see My back; but My face must not be seen.”
