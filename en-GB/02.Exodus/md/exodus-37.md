# Exodus Chapter 37

## Exodus 37:1
Bezalel constructed the ark from acacia wood; its length was two and a half cubits, its width one and a half cubits, and its height one and a half cubits.

## Exodus 37:2
He overlaid it with pure gold, both inside and outside, and made a gold moulding all around it.

## Exodus 37:3
He cast four gold rings for it and attached them to its four feet; two rings on one side and two rings on the other side.

## Exodus 37:4
He fashioned poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.

## Exodus 37:5
He inserted the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark to carry it.

## Exodus 37:6
He also made the atonement cover of pure gold, measuring two and a half cubits long and one and a half cubits wide.

## Exodus 37:7
He crafted two cherubim of hammered gold at the two ends of the atonement cover.

## Exodus 37:8
One cherub was positioned at one end and the other cherub at the opposite end; he made the cherubim of one piece with the atonement cover at the two ends.

## Exodus 37:9
The cherubim had their wings spread upwards, overshadowing the atonement cover with them. They faced each other, looking towards the cover.

## Exodus 37:10
He made the table of acacia wood, two cubits long, one cubit wide, and one and a half cubits high.

## Exodus 37:11
He overlaid it with pure gold and fashioned a gold moulding all around it.

## Exodus 37:12
He also made a rim for it, a handbreadth wide, and put a gold moulding on the rim all around.

## Exodus 37:13
He cast four gold rings for the table and fastened them to the four corners where the legs were.

## Exodus 37:14
The rings were positioned close to the rim to hold the poles for carrying the table.

## Exodus 37:15
He crafted the poles from acacia wood, overlaying them with gold, for the purpose of carrying the table.

## Exodus 37:16
He crafted from pure gold the utensils for the table—its plates, dishes, bowls, and pitchers for pouring out drink offerings.

## Exodus 37:17
He made the lampstand of pure gold, hammering out its base and shaft, with its flowerlike cups, buds, and blossoms all of one piece with it.

## Exodus 37:18
Six branches extended from its sides—three branches on one side and three on the other.

## Exodus 37:19
Each branch had three cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms, and this pattern was consistent for all six branches extending from the lampstand.

## Exodus 37:20
The lampstand itself featured four cups shaped like almond flowers with buds and blossoms.

## Exodus 37:21
A bud was under the first pair of branches extending from the lampstand, a second bud under the second pair, and a third bud under the third pair—six branches in total.

## Exodus 37:22
The buds and branches were all of one piece with the lampstand, a single hammered work of pure gold.

## Exodus 37:23
He made its seven lamps, as well as its wick trimmers and trays, of pure gold.

## Exodus 37:24
He made the lampstand and all its accessories from a single talent of pure gold.

## Exodus 37:25
He constructed the altar of incense from acacia wood, a cubit long and a cubit wide, square, and two cubits high; its horns were of one piece with it.

## Exodus 37:26
He overlaid the top, its sides all around, and its horns with pure gold, and made a gold moulding for it all around.

## Exodus 37:27
He made two gold rings below the moulding on opposite sides to hold the poles used for carrying it.

## Exodus 37:28
He fashioned the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.

## Exodus 37:29
He also made the sacred anointing oil and the pure, fragrant incense, the work of a perfumer.
