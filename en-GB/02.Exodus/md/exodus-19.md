# Exodus Chapter 19

## Exodus 19:1
In the third month after the Israelites had departed from Egypt, on that very day, they arrived in the Desert of Sinai.

## Exodus 19:2
After setting out from Rephidim, they came to the Desert of Sinai and camped there in front of the mountain.

## Exodus 19:3
Moses went up to God, and the Lord called to him from the mountain, saying, “This is what you shall say to the house of Jacob and tell the children of Israel:

## Exodus 19:4
‘You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I carried you on eagles’ wings and brought you to Myself.

## Exodus 19:5
Now, if you fully obey My voice and keep My covenant, then out of all nations you will be My treasured possession, for the whole earth is Mine.

## Exodus 19:6
You shall be for Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words you are to speak to the Israelites.”

## Exodus 19:7
Moses returned and summoned the elders of the people and set before them all the words the Lord had commanded him.

## Exodus 19:8
The people all responded together, “We will do everything the Lord has spoken.” So Moses brought their answer back to the Lord.

## Exodus 19:9
The Lord said to Moses, “I will come to you in a thick cloud, so that the people may hear when I speak with you and may always trust in you.” Then Moses relayed the people's words to the Lord.

## Exodus 19:10
The Lord said to Moses, “Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow. Have them wash their garments

## Exodus 19:11
and be ready by the third day, for on that day the Lord will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.

## Exodus 19:12
Set boundaries for the people all around, warning them, ‘Be careful not to go up the mountain or touch its edge. Whoever touches the mountain shall surely be put to death.

## Exodus 19:13
No hand shall touch them, but they shall be stoned or shot with arrows; whether animal or human, they shall not live. Only when the ram’s horn sounds a long blast may they approach the mountain.”

## Exodus 19:14
So Moses went down from the mountain to the people and consecrated them, and they washed their garments.

## Exodus 19:15
He said to the people, “Prepare yourselves for the third day. Abstain from sexual relations.”

## Exodus 19:16
On the morning of the third day, there was thunder and lightning, with a thick cloud over the mountain and a very loud trumpet blast, causing everyone in the camp to tremble.

## Exodus 19:17
Moses led the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain.

## Exodus 19:18
Mount Sinai was covered with smoke because the Lord descended on it in fire. The smoke rose like the smoke from a furnace, and the whole mountain shook violently.

## Exodus 19:19
As the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him with a voice like thunder.

## Exodus 19:20
The Lord descended to the top of Mount Sinai and called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.

## Exodus 19:21
The Lord said to Moses, “Go down and warn the people not to force their way through to see the Lord, or many of them will perish.

## Exodus 19:22
Even the priests, who come near to the Lord, must purify themselves, or the Lord will act against them.”

## Exodus 19:23
Moses said to the Lord, “The people cannot come up Mount Sinai, because you yourself warned us, ‘Set boundaries around the mountain and consecrate it.’”

## Exodus 19:24
The Lord replied, “Go down and bring Aaron up with you. But do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to the Lord, or He will act against them.”

## Exodus 19:25
So Moses went down to the people and informed them.
