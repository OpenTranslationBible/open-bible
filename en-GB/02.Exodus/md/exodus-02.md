# Exodus Chapter 2

## Exodus 2:1

Now a man from the tribe of Levi went and married a Levite woman.

## Exodus 2:2

The woman conceived and bore a son; seeing that he was a fine child, she hid him for three months.

## Exodus 2:3

When she could hide him no longer, she took a papyrus basket, coated it with tar and pitch, placed the child in it, and set it among the reeds by the Nile's bank.

## Exodus 2:4

His sister stood at a distance to watch what would happen to him.

## Exodus 2:5

Pharaoh’s daughter came down to bathe in the Nile, and her attendants walked along the riverbank. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her slave girl to fetch it.

## Exodus 2:6

Upon opening it, she saw the crying baby and felt compassion for him, saying, “This is one of the Hebrew children.”

## Exodus 2:7

Then his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and call a Hebrew woman who is nursing, to nurse the child for you?”

## Exodus 2:8

“Go,” Pharaoh’s daughter replied. So the girl went and called the child’s mother.

## Exodus 2:9

Pharaoh’s daughter instructed her, “Take this child and nurse him for me, and I will pay you.” So the woman took the child and nursed him.

## Exodus 2:10

When the child grew older, she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses, saying, “I drew him out of the water.”

## Exodus 2:11

In those days, when Moses had grown up, he went out to his people and observed their hard labour, and he saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew, one of his own people.

## Exodus 2:12

He looked around and, seeing no one, he struck down the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.

## Exodus 2:13

The following day, he went out and noticed two Hebrews in conflict. He asked the one in the wrong, “Why are you striking your fellow Hebrew?”

## Exodus 2:14

The man retorted, “Who made you a ruler and judge over us? Are you planning to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?” Moses then feared and thought, “Surely the matter is known.”

## Exodus 2:15

When Pharaoh heard of this, he sought to kill Moses, but Moses fled from Pharaoh and settled in the land of Midian, where he sat down by a well.

## Exodus 2:16

The priest of Midian had seven daughters, who came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their father’s flock.

## Exodus 2:17

Some shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses stood up, helped them, and watered their flock.

## Exodus 2:18

When the girls returned to their father Reuel, he asked, “Why have you returned so early today?”

## Exodus 2:19

They replied, “An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds; he even drew water for us and watered the flock.”

## Exodus 2:20

“Where is he?” Reuel asked his daughters. “Why did you leave him? Invite him to join us for a meal.”

## Exodus 2:21

Moses agreed to stay with the man, who gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses as his wife.

## Exodus 2:22

Zipporah gave birth to a son, and Moses named him Gershom, saying, “I have become a wanderer in a foreign land.”

## Exodus 2:23

During that long period, the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned under their bondage and cried out, and their cry for help because of their slavery reached God.

## Exodus 2:24

God heard their groaning and was mindful of His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

## Exodus 2:25

God looked on the Israelites and took notice of them.
