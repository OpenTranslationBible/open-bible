# Exodus Chapter 13

## Exodus 13:1

The Lord then spoke to Moses and said,

## Exodus 13:2

“Consecrate to Me every firstborn, the first offspring of every womb among the Israelites, whether human or animal; it belongs to Me.”

## Exodus 13:3

Moses said to the people, “Remember this day, the day you came out of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, for the Lord brought you out with a powerful hand. Do not eat anything containing yeast.

## Exodus 13:4

This day marks your departure in the month of Abib.

## Exodus 13:5

When the Lord brings you into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites, and Jebusites, the land He swore to your ancestors to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, you shall observe this rite in this month:

## Exodus 13:6

For seven days eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day hold a feast to the Lord.

## Exodus 13:7

Eat unleavened bread during those seven days; nothing with yeast shall be seen among you, nor shall any yeast be seen anywhere within your borders.

## Exodus 13:8

On that day tell your son, ‘It is because of what the Lord did for me when I came out of Egypt.’

## Exodus 13:9

It shall be like a sign on your hand and a reminder on your forehead that the law of the Lord is to be on your lips, for with a powerful hand the Lord brought you out of Egypt.

## Exodus 13:10

You must keep this ordinance at its appointed time year after year.

## Exodus 13:11

“When the Lord brings you into the land of the Canaanites and gives it to you, as He promised on oath to you and your ancestors,

## Exodus 13:12

you shall give over to the Lord the first offspring of every womb. All the firstborn males of your livestock belong to the Lord.

## Exodus 13:13

For every firstborn donkey, substitute a lamb, but if you do not substitute it, break its neck. Redeem every firstborn among your sons.

## Exodus 13:14

In days to come, when your son asks you, ‘What does this mean?’ say to him, ‘With a powerful hand the Lord brought us out of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.

## Exodus 13:15

When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the Lord killed the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both human and animal. This is why I sacrifice to the Lord the first male offspring of every womb and redeem each of my firstborn sons.’

## Exodus 13:16

It will be like a sign on your hand and as phylacteries on your forehead, for with a powerful hand the Lord brought us out of Egypt.”

## Exodus 13:17

When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines, though it was nearer, for God said, “If they face war, they might change their minds and return to Egypt.”

## Exodus 13:18

So God led the people around by the way of the wilderness towards the Red Sea, and the Israelites went up out of Egypt ready for battle.

## Exodus 13:19

Moses took the bones of Joseph with him because Joseph had made the Israelites swear an oath, saying, “God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones up with you from this place.”

## Exodus 13:20

After leaving Succoth, they camped at Etham on the edge of the wilderness.

## Exodus 13:21

During the day, the Lord went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud to guide them, and by night in a pillar of fire to provide light, enabling them to travel by day or night.

## Exodus 13:22

Neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night left its place from in front of the people.
