## Exodus 38:1
The altar of burnt offering was constructed from acacia wood, measuring five cubits in length, five cubits in width, and three cubits in height, forming a square.

## Exodus 38:2
Horns were crafted on each of its four corners, all of one piece with the altar, and it was overlaid with bronze.

## Exodus 38:3
All the utensils for the altar were made of bronze, including the pots, shovels, basins, meat forks, and firepans.

## Exodus 38:4
A grating of bronze network was made for the altar, positioned beneath its ledge, reaching halfway up the altar.

## Exodus 38:5
Four rings were cast at the four corners of the bronze grating to hold the poles.

## Exodus 38:6
The poles were made of acacia wood and overlaid with bronze.

## Exodus 38:7
The poles were inserted into the rings on the sides of the altar for carrying it. The altar was made hollow, constructed with boards.

## Exodus 38:8
The bronze basin and its stand were crafted from the mirrors of the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting.

## Exodus 38:9
The courtyard was then made. The south side featured hangings of finely twisted linen, a hundred cubits in length.

## Exodus 38:10
This side had twenty pillars with twenty bronze bases, and silver hooks and bands on the pillars.

## Exodus 38:11
The north side was also a hundred cubits long, with twenty pillars and twenty bronze bases, and silver hooks and bands on the pillars.

## Exodus 38:12
The west side had hangings fifty cubits wide, with ten pillars and ten bases, with silver hooks and bands on the pillars.

## Exodus 38:13

## Exodus 38:14
On one side of the entrance, the hangings were fifteen cubits long, with three pillars and three bases.

## Exodus 38:15
Similarly, on the other side of the entrance, there were hangings fifteen cubits long, with three pillars and three bases.

## Exodus 38:16
All the hangings around the courtyard were of finely twisted linen.

## Exodus 38:17
The bases for the pillars were bronze, while the hooks and bands on the pillars were silver, and their tops were overlaid with silver. Thus, all the pillars of the courtyard had silver bands.

## Exodus 38:18
The curtain for the entrance to the courtyard was crafted by a weaver, using blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen. It measured twenty cubits in length and five cubits in height, matching the hangings of the courtyard.

## Exodus 38:19
It had four pillars and four bronze bases. Their hooks and bands were silver, and their tops were overlaid with silver.

## Exodus 38:20
All the pegs of the tabernacle and the surrounding courtyard were made of bronze.

## Exodus 38:21
These are the quantities of materials used for the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the testimony, as recorded by the Levites under the command of Moses, directed by Ithamar, son of Aaron the priest.

## Exodus 38:22
Bezalel, son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, executed all that the Lord commanded Moses.

## Exodus 38:23
With him was Oholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver, designer, and skilled embroiderer in blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and fine linen.

This was a beka per person, that is, half a shekel, according to the sanctuary shekel, from each man aged twenty years or older, totalling 603,550 men.

## Exodus 38:27
The hundred talents of silver were used to cast the bases for the sanctuary and the curtainâ€”one hundred bases from the hundred talents, one talent per base.

## Exodus 38:28
The 1,775 shekels were used to make hooks for the pillars, to overlay their tops, and to make bands for them.

## Exodus 38:29
The bronze from the wave offering amounted to seventy talents and 2,400 shekels.

## Exodus 38:30
This bronze was used to make the bases for the entrance to the tent of meeting, the bronze altar with its bronze grating, and all its utensils.

## Exodus 38:31
It was also used for the bases of the surrounding courtyard and its entrance, and for all the pegs of the tabernacle and the surrounding courtyard.
