# Exodus Chapter 5

## Exodus 5:1
Afterwards, Moses and Aaron approached Pharaoh and said, “Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: ‘Release My people so that they may hold a festival to Me in the wilderness.’”

## Exodus 5:2
Pharaoh responded, “Who is the Lord that I should heed His voice and let Israel go? I do not recognise the Lord, and furthermore, I will not release Israel.”

## Exodus 5:3
They replied, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please allow us to journey three days into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the Lord our God, lest He strike us with plague or the sword.”

## Exodus 5:4
But the king of Egypt said to them, “Moses and Aaron, why do you distract the people from their tasks? Return to your labours!”

## Exodus 5:5
Pharaoh continued, “Behold, the people of the land are now many, and you would have them cease from their labours!”

## Exodus 5:6
That same day, Pharaoh issued a command to the taskmasters and foremen in charge of the people:

## Exodus 5:7
“You shall no longer supply the people with straw for making bricks as before; let them gather straw for themselves.

## Exodus 5:8
But you must still require them to produce the same quota of bricks as previously; do not reduce it. They are idle, and that is why they cry out, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’

## Exodus 5:9
Make the work more burdensome for the men so that they will continue working and pay no attention to falsehoods.”

## Exodus 5:10
So the taskmasters and foremen went out and informed the people, “This is what Pharaoh says: ‘I will not provide you with straw.

## Exodus 5:11
Go and gather straw for yourselves wherever you can find it, but your workload will not be diminished in the slightest.’”

## Exodus 5:12
Thus, the people scattered throughout all of Egypt to collect stubble for straw.

## Exodus 5:13
The taskmasters pressed them, saying, “Complete your daily work quota, just as when you had straw.”

## Exodus 5:14
Pharaoh’s taskmasters beat the Israelite foremen they had appointed, demanding, “Why have you not fulfilled your quota of bricks either yesterday or today, as before?”

## Exodus 5:15
Then the Israelite foremen went and pleaded with Pharaoh, “Why do you treat your servants this way?

## Exodus 5:16
Your servants are given no straw, yet they tell us, ‘Make bricks!’ And behold, your servants are being beaten, but the fault lies with your own people.”

## Exodus 5:17
But Pharaoh said, “You are idle, very idle; that is why you say, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to the Lord.’

## Exodus 5:18
Now go and work; you will not be given any straw, yet you must deliver the full quota of bricks.”

## Exodus 5:19
The Israelite foremen realised they were in a difficult situation when they were told, “You must not reduce your daily quota of bricks.”

## Exodus 5:20
As they departed from Pharaoh, they encountered Moses and Aaron waiting for them.

## Exodus 5:21
And they said to them, “May the Lord look upon you and judge you, for you have made us detestable in the eyes of Pharaoh and his officials, putting a sword in their hand to kill us.”

## Exodus 5:22
Moses returned to the Lord and said, “Lord, why have You brought trouble upon this people? Why did You send me?

## Exodus 5:23
Since I went to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has brought harm upon this people, and You have not delivered Your people at all.”
