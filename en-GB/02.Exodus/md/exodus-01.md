# Exodus Chapter 1

## Exodus 1:1
Here are the names of the sons of Israel who journeyed to Egypt with Jacob, each accompanied by his household:

## Exodus 1:2
Reuben, Simeon, Levi, along with Judah;

## Exodus 1:3
Issachar, Zebulun, together with Benjamin;

## Exodus 1:4
Dan and Naphtali, along with Gad and Asher.

## Exodus 1:5
The descendants of Jacob were seventy in total, but Joseph was already in Egypt.

## Exodus 1:6
Then Joseph died, along with all his brothers and all that generation.

## Exodus 1:7
The Israelites were fruitful and increased greatly; they multiplied and grew exceedingly strong, and the land was filled with them.

## Exodus 1:8
Now a new king arose over Egypt, who did not know of Joseph.

## Exodus 1:9
He said to his people, “Behold, the Israelites have become too numerous and too powerful for us.

## Exodus 1:10
Come, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply further, and in the event of war, they might join our enemies, fight against us, and leave the land.”

## Exodus 1:11
So they appointed taskmasters over them to oppress them with forced labour, and they built storage cities for Pharaoh, Pithom and Rameses.

## Exodus 1:12
Yet the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread, so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites.

## Exodus 1:13
The Egyptians ruthlessly compelled the Israelites to labour,

## Exodus 1:14
making their lives bitter with hard service in mortar and bricks and all kinds of labour in the fields; all their service was imposed on them with harshness.

## Exodus 1:15
The king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah, and the other Puah;

## Exodus 1:16
and he said, “When you assist the Hebrew women in childbirth and observe them on the birthstool, if it is a son, you shall kill him; but if it is a daughter, she shall live.”

## Exodus 1:17
However, the midwives feared God and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but let the boys live.

## Exodus 1:18
The king of Egypt called for the midwives and asked them, “Why have you acted in this way and allowed the boys to live?”

## Exodus 1:19
The midwives replied to Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive.”

## Exodus 1:20
Therefore, God was kind to the midwives, and the people multiplied and grew very strong.

## Exodus 1:21
And because the midwives feared God, He provided them with families of their own.

## Exodus 1:22
Then Pharaoh commanded all his people, “Every son that is born you shall cast into the Nile, but every daughter you shall let live.”
