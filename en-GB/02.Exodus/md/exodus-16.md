# Exodus Chapter 16

## Exodus 16:1
The entire assembly of the Israelites departed from Elim and journeyed to the Wilderness of Sin, which lies between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their exodus from Egypt.

## Exodus 16:2
In the wilderness, the whole congregation of the Israelites complained against Moses and Aaron.

## Exodus 16:3
The Israelites said to them, “If only we had perished by the Lord’s hand in Egypt, where we sat by pots of meat and ate bread to our fill! But you have brought us into this wilderness to starve this entire assembly to death.”

## Exodus 16:4
Then the Lord said to Moses, “Behold, I will rain down bread from heaven for you. The people are to go out each day and gather enough for that day. In doing so, I will test them to see whether they will follow My instructions.

## Exodus 16:5
On the sixth day, they are to prepare what they bring in, and it will be twice as much as they gather on the other days.”

## Exodus 16:6
So Moses and Aaron informed all the Israelites, “In the evening, you will realize that it was the Lord who brought you out of Egypt,

## Exodus 16:7
and in the morning, you will see the glory of the Lord, for He has heard your complaints against Him. Who are we, that you should grumble against us?”

## Exodus 16:8
Moses also said, “You will know that it was the Lord when He gives you meat to eat in the evening and bread to your fill in the morning, because He has heard your grumblings against Him. Who are we? You are not grumbling against us, but against the Lord.”

## Exodus 16:9
Then Moses instructed Aaron, “Say to the entire assembly of the Israelites, ‘Come before the Lord, for He has heard your grumblings.’”

## Exodus 16:10
As Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the Israelites, they turned towards the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud.

## Exodus 16:11
The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,

## Exodus 16:12
“I have heard the grumblings of the Israelites. Speak to them, saying, ‘At twilight you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am the Lord your God.’”

## Exodus 16:13
That evening, quail arrived and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp.

## Exodus 16:14
When the dew evaporated, behold, on the surface of the wilderness there was a fine, flake-like substance, as fine as frost on the ground.

## Exodus 16:15
When the Israelites saw it, they asked one another, “What is it?” For they did not know what it was. Moses said to them, “It is the bread that the Lord has given you to eat.

## Exodus 16:16
This is what the Lord has commanded: ‘Everyone is to gather according to their needs. Take an omer for each person you have in your tent.’”

## Exodus 16:17
The Israelites did as they were instructed; some gathered much, some little.

## Exodus 16:18
When they measured it by the omer, the one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little. Each person gathered as much as they needed.

## Exodus 16:19
Then Moses said to them, “No one should keep any of it until morning.”

## Exodus 16:20
However, they did not listen to Moses; some kept part of it until morning, and it bred worms and stank. So Moses was angry with them.

## Exodus 16:21
Each morning, everyone gathered according to their needs, and when the sun grew hot, it melted away.

## Exodus 16:22
On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much—two omers for each person—and all the leaders of the congregation came and reported this to Moses.

## Exodus 16:23
He said to them, “This is what the Lord has commanded: ‘Tomorrow is to be a day of Sabbath rest, a holy Sabbath to the Lord. Bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil. Save whatever is left and keep it until morning.’”

## Exodus 16:24
So they saved it until morning, as Moses instructed, and it did not stink nor was there a maggot in it.

## Exodus 16:25
Moses said, “Eat it today, because today is a Sabbath to the Lord. You will not find any of it on the ground today.

## Exodus 16:26
For six days you are to gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will not be any.”

## Exodus 16:27
Nevertheless, some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather it, but they found none.

## Exodus 16:28
Then the Lord said to Moses, “How long will you refuse to keep My commands and My instructions?

## Exodus 16:29
See, the Lord has given you the Sabbath; that is why on the sixth day He gives you bread for two days. Everyone is to remain in their place on the seventh day; no one is to go out.”

## Exodus 16:30
So the people rested on the seventh day.

## Exodus 16:31
The Israelites called the bread manna. It was white like coriander seed and tasted like wafers made with honey.

## Exodus 16:32
Moses said, “This is what the Lord has commanded: ‘Take an omer of manna and keep it for future generations, so they can see the bread I gave you to eat in the wilderness when I brought you out of Egypt.’”

## Exodus 16:33
So Moses instructed Aaron, “Take a jar and put an omer of manna in it. Then place it before the Lord to be kept for future generations.”

## Exodus 16:34
As the Lord commanded Moses, Aaron placed it before the Testimony, to be preserved.

## Exodus 16:35
The Israelites ate manna for forty years, until they reached a land that was settled; they ate manna until they came to the border of Canaan.

## Exodus 16:36
(An omer is one-tenth of an ephah.)
