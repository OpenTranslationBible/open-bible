# Exodus Chapter 22

## Exodus 22:1
“If a person steals an ox or a sheep and slaughters it or sells it, they must repay five cattle for the ox and four sheep for the sheep.

## Exodus 22:2
If a thief is caught breaking in and is struck so that they die, there is no guilt of bloodshed on the account of the defender.

## Exodus 22:3
However, if this occurs after sunrise, there is guilt of bloodshed on the defender's account. A thief must certainly make restitution; if they have nothing, they shall be sold for their theft.

## Exodus 22:4
If the stolen item is found alive in their possession, whether it be an ox, a donkey, or a sheep, they must repay double.

## Exodus 22:5
“If someone allows their livestock to graze in a field or vineyard and they stray into another's field, restitution must be made from the best of the offender’s own field or vineyard.

## Exodus 22:6
“If a fire breaks out and spreads to thorn bushes, consuming stacked grain, standing grain, or the field itself, the one who started the fire must make restitution.

## Exodus 22:7
“If someone gives their neighbour money or goods for safekeeping and they are stolen from the neighbour’s house, the thief, if caught, must repay double.

## Exodus 22:8
If the thief is not found, the owner of the house must appear before the judges to determine whether they have laid hands on their neighbour’s property.

## Exodus 22:9
In every case of illegal possession, whether it concerns an ox, a donkey, a sheep, clothing, or any lost property about which someone says, ‘This is mine,’ both parties shall present their cases before the judges. The one whom the judges declare guilty must repay double to the other.

## Exodus 22:10
“If someone gives their neighbour a donkey, an ox, a sheep, or any animal for safekeeping and it dies, is injured, or is taken away while no one is looking,

## Exodus 22:11
an oath before the Lord shall be made by both parties that the neighbour did not lay hands on the other’s property. The owner must accept this and no restitution is required.

## Exodus 22:12
But if the animal was stolen from the neighbour, restitution must be made to the owner.

## Exodus 22:13
If it was torn to pieces by a wild animal, the neighbour must bring the remains as evidence and shall not be required to pay for the torn animal.

## Exodus 22:14
“If someone borrows an animal from their neighbour and it is injured or dies while the owner is not present, they must make full restitution.

## Exodus 22:15
If the owner is with the animal, the borrower will not be required to pay. If the animal was hired, the hire fee covers the loss.

## Exodus 22:16
“If a man seduces a virgin who is not betrothed and sleeps with her, he must pay a dowry for her to become his wife.

## Exodus 22:17
If her father refuses to give her to him, he must pay an amount equal to the dowry for virgins.

## Exodus 22:18
“Do not allow a sorceress to live.

## Exodus 22:19
“Anyone who has sexual relations with an animal shall be put to death.

## Exodus 22:20
“Whoever sacrifices to any god other than the Lord must be utterly destroyed.

## Exodus 22:21
“Do not oppress or mistreat a foreigner, for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt.

## Exodus 22:22
“Do not oppress any widow or orphan.

## Exodus 22:23
If you do oppress them and they cry out to me, I will certainly hear their cry;

## Exodus 22:24
My anger will be kindled, and I will kill you with the sword, and your wives shall become widows and your children fatherless.

## Exodus 22:25
“If you lend money to my people, to the needy among you, do not act as a creditor; charge no interest.

## Exodus 22:26
If you take your neighbour’s cloak as a pledge, return it by sunset,

## Exodus 22:27
for it is their only covering, the cloak for their body. What else can they sleep in? When they cry out to me, I will listen, for I am compassionate.

## Exodus 22:28
“Do not blaspheme God or curse the ruler of your people.

## Exodus 22:29
“Do not hold back offerings from your granaries or your wine. You must give me the firstborn of your sons.

## Exodus 22:30
Do the same with your cattle and your sheep. Let them stay with their mothers for seven days, but give them to me on the eighth day.

## Exodus 22:31
“You are to be holy people to me. Therefore, do not eat the meat of an animal torn by wild beasts; throw it to the dogs.
