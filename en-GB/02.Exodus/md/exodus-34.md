# Exodus Chapter 34

## Exodus 34:1
The Lord said to Moses, “Chisel out two stone tablets like the first ones, and I will write on them the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke.

## Exodus 34:2
Be ready in the morning, and come up Mount Sinai. Present yourself to Me there on top of the mountain.

## Exodus 34:3
No one is to come with you or be seen anywhere on the mountain; not even flocks or herds may graze in front of it.”

## Exodus 34:4
So Moses chiseled out two stone tablets like the first ones and went up Mount Sinai early in the morning, as the Lord had commanded. He carried the two stone tablets in his hands.

## Exodus 34:5
Then the Lord came down in the cloud and stood there with him and proclaimed His name, the Lord.

## Exodus 34:6
And He passed in front of Moses, proclaiming, “The Lord, the Lord, compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness,

## Exodus 34:7
maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. Yet He does not leave the guilty unpunished; He punishes the children and their children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation.”

## Exodus 34:8
Moses bowed to the ground at once and worshiped.

## Exodus 34:9
He said, “Lord, if I have found favour in Your eyes, let the Lord go with us. Although this is a stiff-necked people, forgive our sins and take us as Your inheritance.”

## Exodus 34:10
Then the Lord said, “I am making a covenant with you. Before all your people I will do wonders never before done in any nation. The people you live among will see how awesome is the work I, the Lord, will do for you.

## Exodus 34:11
Obey what I command today. I will drive out before you the Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.

## Exodus 34:12
Be careful not to make a treaty with those who live in the land where you are going, or they will become a snare to you.

## Exodus 34:13
Break down their altars, smash their sacred stones and cut down their Asherah poles.

## Exodus 34:14
Do not worship any other god, for the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.

## Exodus 34:15
Be careful not to make a treaty with those who live in the land; when they prostitute themselves to their gods and sacrifice to them, they will invite you and you will eat their sacrifices.

## Exodus 34:16
And when you take some of their daughters as wives for your sons, they will lead your sons to do the same.

## Exodus 34:17
Do not make any idols.

## Exodus 34:18
Celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread. For seven days eat bread made without yeast, as I commanded, during the month of Aviv, for that is when you came out of Egypt.

## Exodus 34:19
The first offspring of every womb belongs to Me, including all the firstborn males of your livestock, whether oxen or sheep.

## Exodus 34:20
Redeem the firstborn donkey with a lamb. If you do not redeem it, break its neck. Redeem all your firstborn sons. No one is to appear before Me empty-handed.

## Exodus 34:21
Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest; even during ploughing and harvest you must rest.

## Exodus 34:22
Celebrate the Festival of Weeks with the firstfruits of the wheat harvest, and the Festival of Ingathering at the turn of the year.

## Exodus 34:23
Three times a year all your men are to appear before the Sovereign Lord, the God of Israel.

## Exodus 34:24
I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your territory, and no one will covet your land when you go up three times each year to appear before the Lord your God.

## Exodus 34:25
Do not offer the blood of a sacrifice with anything containing yeast, and do not let any of the Passover sacrifice remain until morning.

## Exodus 34:26
Bring the best of the firstfruits of your soil to the house of the Lord your God. Do not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk.

## Exodus 34:27
Then the Lord said to Moses, “Write down these words, for in accordance with them I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.”

## Exodus 34:28
Moses was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights without eating bread or drinking water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant—the Ten Commandments.

## Exodus 34:29
When Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the covenant law in his hands, his face was radiant because he had spoken with the Lord, but he did not realise it.

## Exodus 34:30
When Aaron and the Israelites saw that his face was radiant, they were afraid to come near him.

## Exodus 34:31
But Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the leaders came to him, and he spoke to them.

## Exodus 34:32
Afterward all the Israelites came near, and he gave them all the commands the Lord had given him on Mount Sinai.

## Exodus 34:33
When Moses finished speaking to them, he put a veil over his face.

## Exodus 34:34
But whenever he entered the Lord’s presence to speak with Him, he removed the veil until he came out.

## Exodus 34:35
And when he came out and told the Israelites what he had been commanded, they saw that his face was radiant. Then Moses would put the veil back over his face until he went in to speak with the Lord.
