# Exodus Chapter 34

## Exodus 34:1
The Lord instructed Moses, “Carve out two stone tablets like the previous ones, and I will inscribe upon them the words that were on the original tablets, which you shattered.

## Exodus 34:2
Prepare yourself by morning, and ascend Mount Sinai to present yourself to Me on the summit of the mountain.

## Exodus 34:3
Ensure that no one accompanies you or is visible anywhere on the mountain; even the flocks and herds must not graze in front of the mountain.”

## Exodus 34:4
Thus Moses carved out two stone tablets like the former ones, and he rose early in the morning and ascended Mount Sinai, as the Lord had instructed him, carrying the two stone tablets in his hands.

## Exodus 34:5
The Lord descended in the cloud and stood there with him, and he invoked the name of the Lord.

## Exodus 34:6
The Lord passed before him and proclaimed, “The Lord, the Lord God, compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, and rich in steadfast love and truth,

## Exodus 34:7
maintaining love to thousands, forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin. Yet He will not leave the guilty unpunished, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and grandchildren to the third and fourth generations.”

## Exodus 34:8
Moses quickly bowed to the ground and worshipped.

## Exodus 34:9
He said, “If I have found favour in Your sight, Lord, please let the Lord accompany us. Although this is a stubborn people, forgive our iniquity and our sin, and claim us as Your inheritance.”

## Exodus 34:10
The Lord responded, “I am establishing a covenant. Before all your people, I will perform wonders never before done in any nation in all the world. The people you live among will witness the awe-inspiring deeds that I, the Lord, will accomplish with you.

## Exodus 34:11
Observe what I command you today. I will drive out the Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites from before you.

## Exodus 34:12
Take care not to form a covenant with the inhabitants of the land you are entering, lest it become a snare among you.

## Exodus 34:13
Instead, you shall demolish their altars, shatter their sacred stones, and cut down their Asherah poles.

## Exodus 34:14
Do not worship any other god, for the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.

## Exodus 34:15
Be cautious not to make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land; for when they engage in idolatry and sacrifice to their gods, they will invite you, and you will partake of their sacrifices.

## Exodus 34:16
When you take their daughters as wives for your sons, and their daughters prostitute themselves to their gods, they will lead your sons to do the same.

## Exodus 34:17
Do not create any metal idols.

## Exodus 34:18
Observe the Festival of Unleavened Bread. For seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the appointed time in the month of Aviv, for in that month you departed from Egypt.

## Exodus 34:19
The first offspring of every womb belongs to Me, including all the firstborn males of your livestock, whether cattle or sheep.

## Exodus 34:20
Redeem the firstborn donkey with a lamb, but if you do not redeem it, break its neck. Redeem all your firstborn sons. No one is to appear before Me empty-handed.

## Exodus 34:21
You shall labour for six days, but on the seventh day, you shall rest; even during the ploughing and harvest seasons, you must rest.

## Exodus 34:22
Celebrate the Festival of Weeks with the firstfruits of the wheat harvest, and the Festival of Ingathering at the year's end.

## Exodus 34:23
Three times a year, all your males must appear before the Sovereign Lord, the God of Israel.

## Exodus 34:24
I will drive out nations before you and expand your borders, and no one will covet your land when you go up three times a year to appear before the Lord your God.

## Exodus 34:25
Do not offer the blood of My sacrifice with anything leavened, nor should the sacrifice of the Passover Festival be left until morning.

## Exodus 34:26
Bring the best of the firstfruits of your soil to the house of the Lord your God. Do not boil a young goat in its mother's milk.

## Exodus 34:27
The Lord said to Moses, “Write down these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.”

## Exodus 34:28
Moses remained there with the Lord for forty days and forty nights without eating bread or drinking water. He inscribed on the tablets the words of the covenant—the Ten Commandments.

## Exodus 34:29
When Moses descended from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the covenant law in his hands, he was unaware that his face was radiant because he had spoken with the Lord.

## Exodus 34:30
When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, his face was radiant, and they were afraid to approach him.

## Exodus 34:31
Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the leaders of the community returned to him, and he spoke to them.

## Exodus 34:32
Afterwards, all the Israelites came near, and he relayed to them all the commands the Lord had given him on Mount Sinai.

## Exodus 34:33
When Moses finished speaking with them, he covered his face with a veil.

## Exodus 34:34
Whenever Moses entered the Lord’s presence to speak with Him, he removed the veil until he came out. When he came out and conveyed the commands to the Israelites,

## Exodus 34:35
they observed that his face was radiant. Then Moses would replace the veil over his face until he went in to speak with the Lord.
