# Exodus Chapter 31

## Exodus 31:1
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,

## Exodus 31:2
“See, I have chosen Bezalel, son of Uri, the son of Hur, from the tribe of Judah.

## Exodus 31:3
I have filled him with the Spirit of God, granting him wisdom, understanding, knowledge, and all kinds of craftsmanship,

## Exodus 31:4
to devise artistic designs for working in gold, silver, and bronze,

## Exodus 31:5
and for cutting stones for settings, and for carving wood, to engage in all kinds of crafts.

## Exodus 31:6
Moreover, I have appointed Oholiab, son of Ahisamach, from the tribe of Dan, to assist him. I have also endowed all the skilled artisans with ability, so that they may make everything I have instructed you:

## Exodus 31:7
the tent of meeting, the ark of the covenant law with its atonement cover, and all the furnishings of the tent,

## Exodus 31:8
the table with its articles, the pure gold lampstand with all its accessories, and the altar of incense,

## Exodus 31:9
the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, the basin and its stand,

## Exodus 31:10
and the woven garments, the sacred garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments for his sons to serve as priests,

## Exodus 31:11
as well as the anointing oil and the fragrant incense for the Holy Place. They are to make them according to all that I have commanded you.”

## Exodus 31:12
Then the Lord said to Moses,

## Exodus 31:13
“Speak to the Israelites, saying, ‘You must observe my Sabbaths. This is a sign between me and you for all generations, so that you may know that I am the Lord who makes you holy.

## Exodus 31:14
Therefore, you must keep the Sabbath, for it is holy to you. Anyone who desecrates it must be put to death; whoever does any work on that day must be cut off from their people.

## Exodus 31:15
For six days work may be done, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of complete rest, holy to the Lord. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day must be put to death.

## Exodus 31:16
The Israelites shall observe the Sabbath, celebrating it throughout their generations as a lasting covenant.

## Exodus 31:17
It is a sign between me and the Israelites forever, for in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day he ceased from labour and was refreshed.’”

## Exodus 31:18
When the Lord finished speaking with Moses on Mount Sinai, he gave him the two tablets of the covenant law, tablets of stone inscribed by the finger of God.
