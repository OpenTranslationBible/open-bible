# Exodus Chapter 4

## Exodus 4:1
Moses responded, “What if they do not believe me or heed my words, and say, ‘The Lord has not appeared to you’?”

## Exodus 4:2
The Lord asked him, “What is that in your hand?” He answered, “A staff.”

## Exodus 4:3
The Lord instructed, “Throw it on the ground.” So Moses threw it, and it became a serpent, causing him to flee from it.

## Exodus 4:4
Then the Lord said to Moses, “Reach out your hand and seize it by the tail.” So he reached out, grasped it, and it turned back into a staff in his hand.

## Exodus 4:5
“This is so they may believe that the Lord, the God of their ancestors—the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—has appeared to you.”

## Exodus 4:6
The Lord then said, “Put your hand inside your cloak.” Moses put his hand inside, and when he withdrew it, it was leprous, white as snow.

## Exodus 4:7
“Now put your hand back into your cloak,” He commanded. Moses did so, and when he took it out, it was restored like the rest of his flesh.

## Exodus 4:8
The Lord continued, “If they do not believe you or pay attention to the first sign, they may believe the second.

## Exodus 4:9
But if they do not believe even these two signs or listen to you, take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground. The water you take will become blood on the ground.”

## Exodus 4:10
Moses said to the Lord, “Please, my Lord, I have never been eloquent, neither in the past nor since you have spoken to your servant. I am slow of speech and tongue.”

## Exodus 4:11
The Lord replied, “Who has made the human mouth? Who makes one mute or deaf, seeing or blind? Is it not I, the Lord?

## Exodus 4:12
Now go; I will be with your mouth and will teach you what to say.”

## Exodus 4:13
But Moses pleaded, “Please, my Lord, send someone else.”

## Exodus 4:14
Then the Lord’s anger burned against Moses and He said, “What about your brother Aaron the Levite? I know he speaks well. He is already on his way to meet you, and he will be glad to see you.

## Exodus 4:15
You shall speak to him and put the words in his mouth; I will be with both of you as you speak and will instruct you in what to do.

## Exodus 4:16
He will speak to the people for you, and it will be as if he were your mouth and you were God to him.

## Exodus 4:17
But carry this staff in your hand to perform the signs.”

## Exodus 4:18
Moses then returned to Jethro, his father-in-law, and said, “Please let me go back to my people in Egypt to see if they are still alive.” Jethro replied, “Go in peace.”

## Exodus 4:19
Now the Lord had said to Moses in Midian, “Return to Egypt, for all those who sought your life are dead.”

## Exodus 4:20
So Moses took his wife and sons, mounted them on a donkey, and set out for Egypt, carrying the staff of God in his hand.

## Exodus 4:21
The Lord instructed Moses, “When you return to Egypt, perform before Pharaoh all the wonders I have given you the power to do. However, I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go.

## Exodus 4:22
Then you shall say to Pharaoh, ‘This is what the Lord says: Israel is my firstborn son,

## Exodus 4:23
and I have said to you, “Release my son, so he may worship me.” But you refused to let him go; therefore, I will take the life of your firstborn son.’”

## Exodus 4:24
At a lodging place on the journey, the Lord met Moses and sought to kill him.

## Exodus 4:25
But Zipporah took a flint knife, cut off her son’s foreskin, and touched Moses’ feet with it, saying, “You are a bridegroom of blood to me.”

## Exodus 4:26
So the Lord let him alone. At that time she said “bridegroom of blood,” referring to the circumcision.

## Exodus 4:27
The Lord said to Aaron, “Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.” So he went and met him at the mountain of God and kissed him.

## Exodus 4:28
Moses recounted to Aaron all the words of the Lord with which He had sent him, and all the signs He had commanded him to perform.

## Exodus 4:29
Moses and Aaron then assembled all the elders of the Israelites,

## Exodus 4:30
and Aaron relayed all the words the Lord had spoken to Moses. He also performed the signs in the sight of the people,

## Exodus 4:31
and the people believed. When they heard that the Lord was concerned about them and had seen their affliction, they bowed down and worshipped.
