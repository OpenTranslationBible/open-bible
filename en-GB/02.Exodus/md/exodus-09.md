# Exodus Chapter 9

## Exodus 9:1
Then the Lord said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and tell him, ‘This is what the Lord, the God of the Hebrews, declares: “Release my people, so that they may serve me.”

## Exodus 9:2
If you refuse to let them go and continue to restrain them,

## Exodus 9:3
behold, the hand of the Lord will bring a severe plague upon your livestock in the field—upon the horses, donkeys, camels, cattle, sheep, and goats.

## Exodus 9:4
However, the Lord will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and that of Egypt, so that no animal belonging to the Israelites will perish.’”

## Exodus 9:5
The Lord set a specific time, saying, “Tomorrow the Lord will carry out this action in the land.”

## Exodus 9:6
And the following day, the Lord did so: all the livestock of the Egyptians perished, but not a single animal belonging to the Israelites died.

## Exodus 9:7
Pharaoh sent men to investigate and discovered that not even one of the livestock of the Israelites had died. Yet Pharaoh's heart remained hardened, and he did not release the people.

## Exodus 9:8
Then the Lord instructed Moses and Aaron, “Take handfuls of soot from a kiln, and let Moses throw it into the air in Pharaoh’s presence.

## Exodus 9:9
It will become fine dust over all the land of Egypt, causing boils to break out with sores on people and animals throughout the land.”

## Exodus 9:10
So they took soot from a kiln and stood before Pharaoh. Moses tossed it into the air, and boils broke out with sores on people and animals.

## Exodus 9:11
The magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boils were on the magicians as well as on all the Egyptians.

## Exodus 9:12
But the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the Lord had foretold to Moses.

## Exodus 9:13
Then the Lord said to Moses, “Rise early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh, and say to him, ‘This is what the Lord, the God of the Hebrews, declares: “Let my people go, so that they may serve me,

## Exodus 9:14
or this time I will send the full force of my plagues against you, your officials, and your people, so that you may know that there is no one like me in all the earth.

## Exodus 9:15
For by now I could have stretched out my hand and struck you and your people with a plague that would have wiped you from the earth.

## Exodus 9:16
But I have allowed you to remain for this purpose: to show you my power and to have my name proclaimed throughout the earth.

## Exodus 9:17
You still exalt yourself against my people by not letting them go.

## Exodus 9:18
Therefore, at this time tomorrow, I will send the worst hailstorm that has ever fallen on Egypt, from the day it was founded until now.

## Exodus 9:19
Issue a command now to bring your livestock and everything you have in the field to a place of shelter, for the hail will fall on every person and animal that is found in the field and is not brought inside, and they will die.’”

## Exodus 9:20
Those among Pharaoh’s officials who feared the word of the Lord hurried to bring their servants and their livestock indoors.

## Exodus 9:21
But those who disregarded the word of the Lord left their servants and livestock in the field.

## Exodus 9:22
Then the Lord said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward the sky, so that hail will fall across all of Egypt—on people, animals, and every plant in the fields of Egypt.”

## Exodus 9:23
When Moses stretched out his staff toward the sky, the Lord sent thunder and hail, and fire ran down to the earth. Thus, the Lord rained hail upon the land of Egypt.

## Exodus 9:24
There was hail, and fire flashing continuously amidst the hail, the heaviest storm Egypt had witnessed since it became a nation.

## Exodus 9:25
Throughout Egypt, the hail struck everything in the fields—both people and animals; it beat down every plant and shattered every tree.

## Exodus 9:26
The only place it did not hail was in the land of Goshen, where the Israelites resided.

## Exodus 9:27
Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron. “This time I have sinned,” he said to them. “The Lord is in the right, and I and my people are in the wrong.

## Exodus 9:28
Plead with the Lord, for there has been enough of God’s thunder and hail. I will let you go; you do not have to stay any longer.”

## Exodus 9:29
Moses replied, “As soon as I leave the city, I will spread out my hands to the Lord; the thunder will cease and there will be no more hail, so that you may know that the earth is the Lord’s.

## Exodus 9:30
But I know that you and your officials still do not fear the Lord God.”

## Exodus 9:31
(The flax and barley were ruined, since the barley was in ear and the flax was in bloom.

## Exodus 9:32
But the wheat and spelt were not destroyed, because they ripen later.)

## Exodus 9:33
Then Moses left Pharaoh and went out of the city. He spread out his hands to the Lord; the thunder and hail ceased, and the rain no longer poured down on the earth.

## Exodus 9:34
When Pharaoh saw that the rain, hail, and thunder had stopped, he sinned again: he and his officials hardened their hearts.

## Exodus 9:35
So Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he did not let the Israelites go, just as the Lord had spoken through Moses.
