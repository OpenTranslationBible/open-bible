# Exodus Chapter 40

## Exodus 40:1
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,

## Exodus 40:2
“On the first day of the first month, set up the tabernacle, the tent of meeting.

## Exodus 40:3
Place the ark of the covenant inside and shield it with the curtain.

## Exodus 40:4
Bring in the table and set out what belongs on it. Bring in the lampstand and set up its lamps.

## Exodus 40:5
Place the gold altar of incense in front of the ark of the covenant and put the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle.

## Exodus 40:6
Set the altar of burnt offering in front of the entrance to the tabernacle, the tent of meeting.

## Exodus 40:7
Place the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it.

## Exodus 40:8
Set up the courtyard around it and hang the curtain at the entrance.

## Exodus 40:9
Take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and everything in it; consecrate it and all its furnishings, and it will be holy.

## Exodus 40:10
Anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils; consecrate the altar and it will be most holy.

## Exodus 40:11
Anoint the basin and its stand and consecrate them.

## Exodus 40:12
Bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the tent of meeting and wash them with water.

## Exodus 40:13
Put the sacred garments on Aaron and anoint him and consecrate him so he may serve Me as priest.

## Exodus 40:14
Bring his sons and dress them in tunics.

## Exodus 40:15
Anoint them just as you anointed their father, so they may also serve Me as priests. Their anointing will mark them as a lasting priesthood throughout their generations.”

## Exodus 40:16
Moses did everything just as the Lord commanded him.

## Exodus 40:17
So the tabernacle was set up on the first day of the first month in the second year.

## Exodus 40:18
When Moses set up the tabernacle, he laid its bases, positioned its frames, inserted its crossbars and set up its posts.

## Exodus 40:19
Then he spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering over it, just as the Lord had commanded.

## Exodus 40:20
He took the tablets of the covenant law and placed them in the ark, attached the poles to the ark and put the atonement cover on top.

## Exodus 40:21
Then he brought the ark into the tabernacle, hung the shielding curtain, and shielded the ark of the covenant law, just as the Lord had commanded.

## Exodus 40:22
He placed the table in the tent of meeting on the north side of the tabernacle, outside the curtain.

## Exodus 40:23
He set out the bread on it before the Lord, just as the Lord had commanded.

## Exodus 40:24
He placed the lampstand in the tent of meeting opposite the table on the south side.

## Exodus 40:25
He set up the lamps before the Lord, just as the Lord had commanded.

## Exodus 40:26
Moses placed the gold altar in the tent of meeting in front of the curtain

## Exodus 40:27
and burned fragrant incense on it, just as the Lord had commanded.

## Exodus 40:28
Then he hung the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle.

## Exodus 40:29
He placed the altar of burnt offering near the entrance to the tabernacle and offered burnt offerings and grain offerings on it, just as the Lord had commanded.

## Exodus 40:30
He set the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing.

## Exodus 40:31
Moses, Aaron and his sons used it to wash their hands and feet.

## Exodus 40:32
They washed whenever they entered the tent of meeting or approached the altar, just as the Lord had commanded.

## Exodus 40:33
Then Moses set up the courtyard around the tabernacle and altar and hung the curtain at the entrance. And so Moses completed the work.

## Exodus 40:34
Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.

## Exodus 40:35
Moses could not enter the tent of meeting because the cloud had settled on it, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.

## Exodus 40:36
In all the travels of the Israelites, whenever the cloud lifted from above the tabernacle, they would set out;

## Exodus 40:37
but if the cloud did not lift, they did not set out—until the day it lifted.

## Exodus 40:38
So the cloud of the Lord was over the tabernacle by day, and fire was in the cloud by night, in the sight of all the Israelites throughout all their journeys.
