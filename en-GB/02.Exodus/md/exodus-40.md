“On the first day of the first month, you shall set up the tabernacle, the tent of meeting.

## Exodus 40:3
You shall place the ark of the covenant within it and shield the ark with the veil.

## Exodus 40:4

Position the altar of burnt offering before the entrance to the tabernacle, the tent of meeting.

Set the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar, and fill it with water.

## Exodus 40:8
Set up the courtyard around it and hang the curtain at the gate of the courtyard.

## Exodus 40:9
Take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and everything within it; consecrate it and all its furnishings, and it shall be holy.

## Exodus 40:10
Anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils; consecrate the altar, and it shall be most holy.

## Exodus 40:11
Anoint the basin and its stand, dedicating them.

## Exodus 40:12
Bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the tent of meeting and cleanse them with water.

## Exodus 40:13
Dress Aaron in the sacred garments, anoint him, and consecrate him so that he may serve as a priest to Me.

## Exodus 40:14
Present his sons and clothe them in tunics.

## Exodus 40:15
Anoint them as you anointed their father, so they may serve as priests to Me. Their anointing shall be for a perpetual priesthood throughout their generations.”

## Exodus 40:16
Moses carried out all the tasks exactly as the Lord had instructed him.

## Exodus 40:17
In the first month of the second year, on the first day, the tabernacle was set up.

## Exodus 40:18
Moses set up the tabernacle, laid its bases, erected its frames, inserted its crossbars, and set up its posts.

## Exodus 40:19
He spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering over the tent, as the Lord had commanded him.

## Exodus 40:20
He took the tablets of the covenant law and placed them in the ark, attached the poles to the ark, and covered it with the atonement cover.

## Exodus 40:21
He brought the ark into the tabernacle, hung the shielding curtain, and screened off the ark of the covenant, as the Lord had commanded him.

## Exodus 40:22
He placed the table in the tent of meeting on the north side of the tabernacle, outside the veil.

## Exodus 40:23
He set the bread in order upon it before the Lord, as the Lord had commanded him.

## Exodus 40:24
He positioned the lampstand in the tent of meeting opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle.

## Exodus 40:25
He set up the lamps before the Lord, as the Lord had commanded him.

## Exodus 40:26
He placed the gold altar in the tent of meeting in front of the veil.

## Exodus 40:27
He burned fragrant incense on it, as the Lord had commanded him.

## Exodus 40:28
He hung the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle.

## Exodus 40:29
He set the altar of burnt offering near the entrance to the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, and offered burnt offerings and grain offerings on it, as the Lord had commanded him.

## Exodus 40:30
He placed the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and filled it with water for washing.

## Exodus 40:31
Moses, Aaron, and his sons used it to wash their hands and feet.

## Exodus 40:32
They washed whenever they entered the tent of meeting or approached the altar, as the Lord had commanded Moses.

## Exodus 40:33
Then Moses set up the courtyard around the tabernacle and altar, and hung the curtain at the entrance to the courtyard. Thus Moses completed the work.

## Exodus 40:34
Then the cloud enveloped the tent of meeting, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.

## Exodus 40:35
Moses was unable to enter the tent of meeting because the cloud had settled upon it, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.

## Exodus 40:36
Throughout all their journeys, whenever the cloud lifted from above the tabernacle, the Israelites would set out.

## Exodus 40:37
But if the cloud did not lift, they did not set out until the day it lifted.

## Exodus 40:38
For the cloud of the Lord was over the tabernacle by day, and fire was in the cloud by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel throughout all their journeys.
