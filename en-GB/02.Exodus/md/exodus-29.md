## Exodus 29:33
They shall eat those things by which atonement was made at their ordination and consecration, but no outsider shall eat them, because they are holy.

## Exodus 29:34
If any of the flesh of ordination or any bread remains until morning, you shall burn the remainder with fire; it shall not be eaten, because it is holy.

## Exodus 29:35
“Carry out for Aaron and his sons everything I have commanded you, taking seven days to ordain them.

## Exodus 29:36
Each day offer a bull as a sin offering for atonement, and purify the altar when you make atonement for it, and anoint it to consecrate it.

## Exodus 29:37
For seven days make atonement for the altar and consecrate it; then the altar shall be most holy, and whatever touches the altar shall be holy.
