You shall put them in one basket and present them in the basket along with the bull and the two rams.

## Exodus 29:4

Then you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the tent of meeting, and wash them with water.

Then you shall take the anointing oil and pour it on his head, and anoint him.

## Exodus 29:8

You shall also bring his sons and put tunics on them.

## Exodus 29:9

And you shall wrap belts around them, Aaron and his sons, and tie headbands on them; and the priesthood shall be theirs as a permanent statute. So you shall ordain Aaron and his sons.

Then you shall bring the bull in front of the tent of meeting, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the bull.

## Exodus 29:11

And you shall slaughter the bull before the Lord at the entrance of the tent of meeting.

You shall take all the fat that covers the entrails, the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, and offer them up in smoke on the altar.

But the flesh of the bull, its hide, and its refuse, you shall burn with fire outside the camp; it is a sin offering.

## Exodus 29:15

You shall also take the one ram, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the ram;

## Exodus 29:16

And you shall slaughter the ram, and take its blood and sprinkle it around on the altar.

## Exodus 29:17

Then you shall cut the ram into pieces, and wash its entrails and its legs, and put them with its pieces and its head.

## Exodus 29:18

You shall offer up in smoke the whole ram on the altar; it is a burnt offering to the Lord: it is a soothing aroma, an offering by fire to the Lord.

## Exodus 29:19

Then you shall take the second ram, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the ram;

## Exodus 29:20

And you shall slaughter the ram, and take some of its blood and put it on the lobe of Aaron’s right ear and on the lobes of his sons’ right ears, and on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet, and sprinkle the rest of the blood around on the altar.

## Exodus 29:21

Then you shall take some of the blood that is on the altar, and some of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it on Aaron and on his garments, and on his sons and on his sons’ garments with him; so he and his garments shall be consecrated, as well as his sons and his sons’ garments with him.

## Exodus 29:22

You shall also take the fat from the ram and the fat tail, and the fat that covers the entrails, and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, and the right thigh (for it is a ram of ordination),

## Exodus 29:23

And one loaf of bread, and one cake of bread mixed with oil, and one wafer from the basket of unleavened bread which is set before the Lord;

## Exodus 29:24

And you shall put all these in the hands of Aaron and in the hands of his sons, and wave them as a wave offering before the Lord.

## Exodus 29:25

Then you shall take them from their hands and offer them up in smoke on the altar on the burnt offering as a soothing aroma before the Lord; it is an offering by fire to the Lord.

## Exodus 29:26

Then you shall take the breast of Aaron’s ram of ordination, and wave it as a wave offering before the Lord; and it shall be your portion.

## Exodus 29:27

And you shall consecrate the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the contribution which was waved and which was lifted up from the ram of ordination, from the one that was for Aaron and from the one that was for his sons.

## Exodus 29:28

It shall be a permanent statute for Aaron and his sons from the sons of Israel, for it is a contribution; and it shall be a contribution from the sons of Israel from their peace offerings, their contribution to the Lord.

## Exodus 29:29

The holy garments of Aaron shall be for his sons after him, so that they may be anointed and ordained in them.

## Exodus 29:30

For seven days the one of his sons who is priest in his place shall put them on when he enters the tent of meeting to serve in the Holy Place.

## Exodus 29:31

You shall take the ram of ordination and boil its flesh in a holy place.

## Exodus 29:32

And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram and the bread that is in the basket, at the entrance of the tent of meeting.

## Exodus 29:33

They shall eat those things by which atonement was made at their ordination and consecration; but a layman shall not eat them, because they are holy.

## Exodus 29:34

And if any of the flesh of ordination or any of the bread remains until morning, then you shall burn the remainder with fire; it shall not be eaten, because it is holy.

## Exodus 29:35

So you shall do to Aaron and to his sons, according to everything that I have commanded you; you shall ordain them through seven days.

## Exodus 29:36

Each day you shall offer a bull as a sin offering for atonement, and you shall purify the altar when you make atonement for it, and you shall anoint it to consecrate it.

## Exodus 29:37

For seven days you shall make atonement for the altar and consecrate it; then the altar shall be most holy, and whatever touches the altar shall be holy.

## Exodus 29:38

Now this is what you shall offer on the altar: two one-year-old lambs each day, continuously.

## Exodus 29:39

The one lamb you shall offer in the morning, and the other lamb you shall offer at twilight;

## Exodus 29:40

And there shall be a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a fourth of a hin of beaten oil, and a fourth of a hin of wine as a drink offering with the one lamb.

## Exodus 29:41

The other lamb you shall offer at twilight, and shall offer with it the same grain offering and the same drink offering as in the morning, for a soothing aroma, an offering by fire to the Lord.

## Exodus 29:42

It shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the entrance of the tent of meeting before the Lord, where I will meet with you, to speak to you there.

## Exodus 29:43

I will meet there with the sons of Israel, and it shall be consecrated by My glory.

## Exodus 29:44

I will consecrate the tent of meeting and the altar; I will also consecrate Aaron and his sons to serve as priests to Me.

## Exodus 29:45

I will dwell among the sons of Israel and will be their God.

## Exodus 29:46

They shall know that I am the Lord their God who brought them out of the land of Egypt, so that I might dwell among them; I am the Lord their God.
