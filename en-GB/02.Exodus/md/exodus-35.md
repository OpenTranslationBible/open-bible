# Exodus Chapter 35

## Exodus 35:1
Moses gathered together all the assembly of the Israelites and said to them, “These are the instructions the Lord has given you to follow:

## Exodus 35:2
For six days, work shall be done, but the seventh day shall be a holy day for you, a Sabbath of complete rest to the Lord. Whoever does any work on it shall be put to death.

## Exodus 35:3
You must not light a fire in any of your homes on the Sabbath day.”

## Exodus 35:4
Moses addressed the entire assembly of the Israelites, saying, “This is what the Lord has commanded:

## Exodus 35:5
Take from what you have a contribution for the Lord. Everyone who is willing is to bring to the Lord a contribution of gold, silver, and bronze;

## Exodus 35:6
violet, purple, and scarlet yarn, and fine linen; goats' hair;

## Exodus 35:7
ram skins dyed red and another type of fine leather; acacia wood;

## Exodus 35:8
olive oil for the light; spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense;

## Exodus 35:9
and onyx stones and other gems to be set in the ephod and breastpiece.

## Exodus 35:10
“All who are skilled among you are to come and make everything the Lord has commanded:

## Exodus 35:11
the tabernacle with its tent and its covering, its hooks, frames, crossbars, posts, and bases;

## Exodus 35:12
the ark with its poles, the atonement cover, and the curtain that shields it;

## Exodus 35:13
the table with its poles and all its utensils, and the bread of the Presence;

## Exodus 35:14
the lampstand for the light with its accessories, lamps, and oil for the light;

## Exodus 35:15
the altar of incense with its poles, the anointing oil and the fragrant incense; the curtain for the doorway at the entrance to the tabernacle;

## Exodus 35:16
the altar of burnt offering with its bronze grating, its poles, and all its utensils; the basin with its stand;

## Exodus 35:17
the curtains of the courtyard with its posts and bases, and the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard;

## Exodus 35:18
the tent pegs for the tabernacle and for the courtyard, and their ropes;

## Exodus 35:19
the woven garments worn for ministering in the sanctuary—the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons when they serve as priests.”

## Exodus 35:20
Then all the assembly of the Israelites departed from Moses’ presence,

## Exodus 35:21
and everyone whose heart was stirred and whose spirit was willing came and brought the Lord’s contribution for the work on the tent of meeting, for all its service, and for the sacred garments.

## Exodus 35:22
All who were willing, both men and women, came and brought gold jewellery of all kinds: brooches, earrings, rings, and ornaments. They all presented their gold as a wave offering to the Lord.

## Exodus 35:23
Everyone who had violet, purple, or scarlet yarn, or fine linen, or goats' hair, ram skins dyed red, or fine leather brought them.

## Exodus 35:24
Everyone who could make a contribution of silver or bronze brought it as an offering to the Lord, and everyone who had acacia wood for any part of the work brought it.

## Exodus 35:25
Every skilled woman spun with her hands and brought what she had spun—violet, purple, or scarlet yarn, and fine linen.

## Exodus 35:26
And all the women whose hearts were stirred with skill spun the goats' hair.

## Exodus 35:27
The leaders brought onyx stones and other gems to be set in the ephod and breastpiece;

## Exodus 35:28
and the spices and olive oil for the light, for the anointing oil, and for the fragrant incense.

## Exodus 35:29
All the Israelite men and women whose hearts were willing brought to the Lord voluntary offerings for all the work the Lord through Moses had commanded them to do.

## Exodus 35:30
Then Moses said to the Israelites, “See, the Lord has called by name Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,

## Exodus 35:31
and he has filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, understanding, knowledge, and all kinds of craftsmanship—

## Exodus 35:32
to create artistic designs for working in gold, silver, and bronze,

## Exodus 35:33
to cut and set stones, to work in wood, and to engage in all kinds of artistic crafts.

## Exodus 35:34
He has also given both him and Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, the ability to teach others.

## Exodus 35:35
He has filled them with skill to perform all kinds of work as engravers, designers, embroiderers in violet, purple, and scarlet yarn, and fine linen, and weavers—all of them skilled workers and designers.
