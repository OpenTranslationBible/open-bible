## Zephaniah 1:2

> “I will utterly sweep away everything
> from the face of the earth,” declares the Lord.

## Zephaniah 1:3

> “I will sweep away both man and beast;
> I will remove the birds of the sky
> and the fish of the sea,
> and the ruins along with the wicked.
> I will cut off mankind from the face of the earth,” declares the Lord.

## Zephaniah 1:4

> “I will stretch out my hand against Judah
> and against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
> I will cut off every remnant of Baal from this place,
> and the names of the idolatrous priests along with the other priests.

## Zephaniah 1:5

> Those who bow down on the rooftops to the starry host,
> and those who bow down and swear by the Lord and also swear by Milcom,

## Zephaniah 1:6

> those who have turned away from following the Lord
> and have neither sought the Lord nor inquired of him.”

## Zephaniah 1:7

> Be silent before the Sovereign Lord,
> for the day of the Lord is near.
> The Lord has prepared a sacrifice;
> he has consecrated his guests.

## Zephaniah 1:8

> “On the day of the Lord’s sacrifice,
> I will punish the princes, the king’s sons,
> and all who wear foreign clothing.

## Zephaniah 1:9

> On that day I will punish all who leap over the threshold,
> who fill their master’s house with violence and deceit.

## Zephaniah 1:10

> “On that day,” declares the Lord,
> “a cry will be heard from the Fish Gate,
> wailing from the Second Quarter,
> and a loud crash from the hills.

## Zephaniah 1:11

> Wail, you who live in the market district,
> for all your merchants will be wiped out;
> all who weigh out silver will be cut off.

## Zephaniah 1:12

> At that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps
> and punish those who are complacent,
> who are like wine left on its dregs,
> who say in their hearts,
> ‘The Lord will do nothing, either good or bad.’

## Zephaniah 1:13

> Their wealth will be plundered,
> their houses laid waste.
> Though they build houses, they will not dwell in them;
> though they plant vineyards, they will not drink the wine thereof.”

## Zephaniah 1:14

> The great day of the Lord is near
> —near and coming swiftly.
> The cry on the day of the Lord is bitter;
> the warrior shouts his battle cry.

## Zephaniah 1:15

> That day will be a day of wrath,
> a day of distress and anguish,
> a day of ruin and desolation,
> a day of darkness and gloom,
> a day of clouds and thick darkness,

## Zephaniah 1:16

> a day of trumpet and battle cry
> against the fortified cities
> and against the high corner towers.

## Zephaniah 1:17

> “I will bring distress on mankind,
> so that they will walk like the blind,
> because they have sinned against the Lord.
> Their blood will be poured out like dust
> and their flesh like dung.

## Zephaniah 1:18

> Neither their silver nor their gold
> will be able to save them
> on the day of the Lord’s wrath.
> In the fire of his jealousy,
> the whole earth will be consumed,
> for he will make a complete end,
> indeed a terrifying one,
> of all the inhabitants of the earth.
