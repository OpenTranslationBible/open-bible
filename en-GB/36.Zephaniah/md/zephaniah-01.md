## Zephaniah 1:2

> “I will completely remove all things  
> From the face of the earth,” declares the Lord.

## Zephaniah 1:3

> “I will remove human and animal life,  
> I will remove the birds of the sky  
> And the fish of the sea,  
> And the ruins along with the wicked;  
> And I will eliminate mankind from the face of the earth,” declares the Lord.

## Zephaniah 1:4

> “So I will stretch out My hand against Judah  
> And against all the inhabitants of Jerusalem.  
> And I will eliminate the remnant of Baal from this place,  
> The names of the idolatrous priests along with the priests,

## Zephaniah 1:5

> And those who bow down on the housetops to the heavenly lights,  
> And those who bow down and swear to the Lord,  
> But also swear by Milcom,

## Zephaniah 1:6

> And those who have turned back from following the Lord,  
> And those who have not sought the Lord nor inquired of Him.”

## Zephaniah 1:7

> Be silent before the Lord God!  
> For the day of the Lord is near,  
> Because the Lord has prepared a sacrifice,  
> He has consecrated His guests.

## Zephaniah 1:8

> “Then it will come about on the day of the Lord’s sacrifice  
> That I will punish the princes, the king’s sons,  
> And all who clothe themselves with foreign garments.

## Zephaniah 1:9

> And on that day I will punish all who leap on the temple threshold,  
> Who fill the house of their lord with violence and deceit.

## Zephaniah 1:10

> And on that day,” declares the Lord,  
> “There will be the sound of a cry from the Fish Gate,  
> Wailing from the Second Quarter,  
> And a loud crash from the hills.

## Zephaniah 1:11

> Wail, you inhabitants of the Mortar,  
> Because all the people of Canaan will be destroyed;  
> All who weigh out silver will be eliminated.

## Zephaniah 1:12

> And it will come about at that time  
> That I will search Jerusalem with lamps,  
> And I will punish the people  
> Who are stagnant in spirit,  
> Who say in their hearts,  
> ‘The Lord will not do good nor harm!’

## Zephaniah 1:13

> Their wealth will become plunder,  
> And their houses desolate;  
> Yes, they will build houses but not inhabit them,  
> And plant vineyards but not drink their wine.”

## Zephaniah 1:14

> The great day of the Lord is near,  
> Near and coming very quickly;  
> Listen, the day of the Lord!  
> In it the warrior cries out bitterly.

## Zephaniah 1:15

> That day is a day of wrath,  
> A day of trouble and distress,  
> A day of destruction and desolation,  
> A day of darkness and gloom,  
> A day of clouds and thick darkness,

## Zephaniah 1:16

> A day of trumpet and battle cry  
> Against the fortified cities  
> And the high corner towers.

## Zephaniah 1:17

> I will bring distress on mankind  
> So that they will walk like those who are blind,  
> Because they have sinned against the Lord;  
> And their blood will be poured out like dust,  
> And their flesh like dung.

## Zephaniah 1:18

> Neither their silver nor their gold  
> Will be able to save them  
> On the day of the Lord’s wrath;  
> And all the earth will be devoured  
> By the fire of His jealousy.  
> For He will make a complete end,  
> Indeed a horrifying one,  
> Of all the inhabitants of the earth.
