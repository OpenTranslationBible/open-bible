> She accepted no correction.  
> She did not place her trust in the Lord,  
> She did not draw near to her God.

## Zephaniah 3:3

> Her officials within her are roaring lions,  
> Her judges are wolves at evening;  
> They leave nothing for the morning.

## Zephaniah 3:4

> Her prophets are arrogant, deceitful men;  
> Her priests have desecrated the sanctuary,  
> They have violated the Law.

## Zephaniah 3:5

> The Lord is righteous in her midst;  
> He will do no injustice.  
> Every morning He brings His justice to light;  
> He does not fail.  
> But the unjust knows no shame.

## Zephaniah 3:6

> “I have removed nations;  
> Their corner towers stand abandoned.  
> I have devastated their streets,  
> With no one passing by;  
> Their cities lie in ruins,  
> Without a person, without an inhabitant.

## Zephaniah 3:7

> I said, ‘You will surely fear Me,  
> You will accept correction.’  
> So her dwelling place will not be destroyed  
> In accordance with everything I have appointed for her.  
> Instead, they were eager to corrupt all their deeds.

## Zephaniah 3:8

> Therefore wait for Me,” declares the Lord,  
> “For the day when I rise up as a witness.  
> Indeed, My decision is to gather nations,  
> To assemble kingdoms,  
> To pour out on them My indignation,  
> All My burning anger;  
> For all the earth will be consumed  
> By the fire of My zeal.

> For then I will grant to the peoples  
> Pure speech,  
> So that all of them may call on the name of the Lord,  
> To serve Him together.

> From beyond the rivers of Cush  
> My worshippers, the daughter of My dispersed people,  
> Will bring My offerings.

## Zephaniah 3:11

> On that day you will feel no shame  
> Because of all your deeds  
> By which you have rebelled against Me;  
> For then I will remove from among you  
> Those who celebrate in pride,  
> And you will never again be arrogant on My holy mountain.

## Zephaniah 3:12

> But I will leave among you  
> A humble and lowly people,  
> And they will find refuge in the name of the Lord.

## Zephaniah 3:13

> The remnant of Israel will do no wrong  
> Nor tell lies,  
> Nor will a deceitful tongue  
> Be found in their mouths;  
> For they will feed and lie down  
> With no one to make them afraid.”

> You will no longer fear disaster.

> On that day it will be said to Jerusalem:  
> “Do not be afraid, Zion;  
> Do not let your hands grow weak.

> The Lord your God is in your midst,  
> A mighty warrior who saves.  
> He will rejoice over you with gladness,  
> He will be quiet in His love,  
> He will exult over you with joyful singing.

> Against all your oppressors;  
> I will save those who are lame  
> And gather the scattered,  
> And I will transform their shame into praise and renown  
> In all the earth.

## Zephaniah 3:20

> At that time I will bring you in,  
> Even at the time when I gather you together;  
> Indeed, I will make you renowned and praised  
> Among all the peoples of the earth,  
> When I restore your fortunes before your eyes,”  
> Says the Lord.
