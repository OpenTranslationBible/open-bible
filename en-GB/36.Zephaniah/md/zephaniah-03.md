# Zephaniah Chapter 3

## Zephaniah 3:1

> Woe to her who is rebellious and defiled,  
> The tyrannical city!

## Zephaniah 3:2

> She obeyed no voice,  
> She accepted no discipline.  
> She did not trust in the Lord,  
> She did not approach her God.

## Zephaniah 3:3

> Her officials within her are roaring lions,  
> Her judges are wolves at evening;  
> They leave nothing for the morning.

## Zephaniah 3:4

> Her prophets are insolent, treacherous men;  
> Her priests have profaned the sanctuary,  
> They have done violence to the Law.

## Zephaniah 3:5

> The Lord is righteous in her midst;  
> He will do no injustice.  
> Every morning He brings His justice to light;  
> He does not fail.  
> But the unjust knows no shame.

## Zephaniah 3:6

> “I have eliminated nations;  
> Their corner towers are deserted.  
> I have laid waste their streets,  
> With no one passing by;  
> Their cities have been laid waste,  
> Without a person, without an inhabitant.

## Zephaniah 3:7

> I said, ‘You will certainly fear Me,  
> You will accept discipline.’  
> So her dwelling place will not be eliminated  
> In accordance with everything I have appointed for her.  
> Instead, they were eager to corrupt all their deeds.

## Zephaniah 3:8

> Therefore wait for Me,” declares the Lord,  
> “For the day when I rise up as a witness.  
> Indeed, My decision is to gather nations,  
> To assemble kingdoms,  
> To pour out on them My indignation,  
> All My burning anger;  
> For all the earth will be devoured  
> By the fire of My zeal.

## Zephaniah 3:9

> For then I will restore to the peoples  
> Pure lips,  
> So that all of them may call on the name of the Lord,  
> To serve Him shoulder to shoulder.

## Zephaniah 3:10

> From beyond the rivers of Cush  
> My worshippers, the daughter of My dispersed people,  
> Will bring My offerings.

## Zephaniah 3:11

> On that day you will feel no shame  
> Because of all your deeds  
> By which you have rebelled against Me;  
> For then I will remove from among you  
> Those who celebrate in pride,  
> And you will never again be arrogant on My holy mountain.

## Zephaniah 3:12

> But I will leave among you  
> A humble and lowly people,  
> And they will take refuge in the name of the Lord.

## Zephaniah 3:13

> The remnant of Israel will do no wrong  
> Nor tell lies,  
> Nor will a deceitful tongue  
> Be found in their mouths;  
> For they will feed and lie down  
> With no one to make them afraid.”

## Zephaniah 3:14

> Shout for joy, daughter of Zion!  
> Shout in triumph, Israel!  
> Rejoice and triumph with all your heart,  
> Daughter of Jerusalem!

## Zephaniah 3:15

> The Lord has taken away His judgments against you,  
> He has cleared away your enemies.  
> The King of Israel, the Lord, is in your midst;  
> You will no longer fear disaster.

## Zephaniah 3:16

> On that day it will be said to Jerusalem:  
> “Do not be afraid, Zion;  
> Do not let your hands fall limp.

## Zephaniah 3:17

> The Lord your God is in your midst,  
> A victorious warrior.  
> He will rejoice over you with joy,  
> He will be quiet in His love,  
> He will rejoice over you with shouts of joy.

## Zephaniah 3:18

> I will gather those who grieve about the appointed feasts—  
> They came from you, Zion;  
> The disgrace of exile is a burden on them.

## Zephaniah 3:19

> Behold, I am going to deal at that time  
> With all your oppressors;  
> I will save those who limp  
> And gather the scattered,  
> And I will turn their shame into praise and fame  
> In all the earth.

## Zephaniah 3:20

> At that time I will bring you in,  
> Even at the time when I gather you together;  
> Indeed, I will make you renowned and praised  
> Among all the peoples of the earth,  
> When I restore your fortunes before your eyes,”  
> Says the Lord.
