# 2 Thessalonians Chapter 3

## 2 Thessalonians 3:1

Finally, dear friends, pray for us that the word of the Lord may spread swiftly and be honoured, just as it was with you;

## 2 Thessalonians 3:2

and that we will be rescued from perverse and evil people; for not all have faith.

## 2 Thessalonians 3:3

Yet the Lord is faithful, and He will strengthen and guard you from the evil one.

## 2 Thessalonians 3:4

We have confidence in the Lord regarding you, that you are doing and will continue to do what we instruct.

## 2 Thessalonians 3:5

May the Lord guide your hearts towards the love of God and the endurance of Christ.

## 2 Thessalonians 3:6

Now we instruct you, dear friends, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to keep away from every believer who leads a disorderly life and not one in accordance with the tradition you received from us.

## 2 Thessalonians 3:7

For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example, because we did not behave in an undisciplined manner among you,

## 2 Thessalonians 3:8

nor did we eat anyoneâ€™s bread without paying for it, but with labour and hardship we worked night and day so that we would not be a burden to any of you;

## 2 Thessalonians 3:9

not because we lack the right to such support, but in order to present ourselves as an example for you to imitate.

## 2 Thessalonians 3:10

For even when we were with you, we gave you this instruction: if anyone is unwilling to work, they should not eat.

## 2 Thessalonians 3:11

For we hear that some among you are living in a disorderly manner, doing no work at all, but being busybodies.

## 2 Thessalonians 3:12

Now we command and urge such individuals in the Lord Jesus Christ to work quietly and eat their own bread.

## 2 Thessalonians 3:13

But as for you, dear friends, do not become weary in doing good.

## 2 Thessalonians 3:14

If anyone does not comply with our instructions in this letter, take special note of that person and do not associate with them, so that they may feel ashamed.

## 2 Thessalonians 3:15

Yet do not consider them as an enemy, but warn them as a sibling.

## 2 Thessalonians 3:16

Now may the Lord of peace Himself continually grant you peace in every situation. The Lord be with you all!

## 2 Thessalonians 3:17

I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand, and this is a distinguishing mark in every letter; this is how I write.

## 2 Thessalonians 3:18

May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
