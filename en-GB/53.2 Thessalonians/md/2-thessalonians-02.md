# 2 Thessalonians Chapter 2

## 2 Thessalonians 2:1

We appeal to you, dear brothers and sisters, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering to Him,

## 2 Thessalonians 2:2

that you should not be easily unsettled or alarmed by a spirit, a message, or a letter claiming to be from us, suggesting that the day of the Lord has already arrived.

## 2 Thessalonians 2:3

Let no one mislead you in any manner! For that day will not arrive unless the rebellion occurs first, and the man of lawlessness is unveiled, the son of destruction,

## 2 Thessalonians 2:4

who stands against and elevates himself above every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his place in the temple of God, presenting himself as God.

## 2 Thessalonians 2:5

Do you not recall that while I was still with you, I used to tell you these things?

## 2 Thessalonians 2:6

And you are aware of what currently restrains him, so that he will be revealed at the proper time.

## 2 Thessalonians 2:7

For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work; only He who now holds it back will continue to do so until He is taken out of the way.

## 2 Thessalonians 2:8

Then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will eliminate with the breath of His mouth and bring to an end by the splendour of His coming;

## 2 Thessalonians 2:9

that is, the one whose arrival is in line with the workings of Satan, accompanied by all power and deceptive signs and wonders,

## 2 Thessalonians 2:10

and with all the deceit of wickedness for those who are perishing, because they did not welcome the love of the truth that would save them.

## 2 Thessalonians 2:11

Because of this, God will allow them to be influenced by a strong delusion, so that they will believe what is false,

## 2 Thessalonians 2:12

so that all will be judged who did not believe the truth but delighted in wickedness.

## 2 Thessalonians 2:13

Yet we ought always to give thanks to God for you, dear brothers and sisters loved by the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning for salvation through the sanctifying work of the Spirit and through belief in the truth.

## 2 Thessalonians 2:14

It was for this purpose He called you through our gospel, so that you might share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.

## 2 Thessalonians 2:15

Therefore, dear brothers and sisters, stand firm and hold fast to the teachings we passed on to you, whether by word of mouth or by letter.

## 2 Thessalonians 2:16

Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father, who loved us and by His grace gave us eternal encouragement and good hope,

## 2 Thessalonians 2:17

encourage and strengthen your hearts in every good deed and word.
