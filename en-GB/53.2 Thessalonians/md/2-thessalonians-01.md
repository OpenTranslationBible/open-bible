# 2 Thessalonians Chapter 1

## 2 Thessalonians 1:1

From Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy,  
to the church of the Thessalonians, of God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:

## 2 Thessalonians 1:2

May you receive grace and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

## 2 Thessalonians 1:3

We ought always to give thanks to God for you, brothers and sisters, as is fitting, because your faith is increasing abundantly, and the love of each and every one of you toward one another grows ever greater.

## 2 Thessalonians 1:4

Thus, we speak highly of you among the churches of God for your perseverance and faith during all your persecutions and afflictions which you endure.

## 2 Thessalonians 1:5

This clearly shows God’s righteous judgment, so that you may be deemed worthy of the kingdom of God, for which indeed you are suffering.

## 2 Thessalonians 1:6

For it is just for God to bring affliction upon those who trouble you,

## 2 Thessalonians 1:7

and to give relief to you who are afflicted, along with us, when the Lord Jesus will be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in flaming fire,

## 2 Thessalonians 1:8

bringing justice to those who do not know God and to those who do not follow the gospel of our Lord Jesus.

## 2 Thessalonians 1:9

These individuals will face the consequence of eternal destruction, separated from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power,

## 2 Thessalonians 1:10

when He comes to be glorified among His saints on that day, and to be marvelled at among all who have believed—because our testimony to you was believed.

## 2 Thessalonians 1:11

To this end we also pray for you always, that our God will consider you worthy of your calling, and fulfil every desire for goodness and the work of faith with power,

## 2 Thessalonians 1:12

so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in Him, through the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
