# Joshua Chapter 14

## Joshua 14:1

These are the areas that the Israelites inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the tribes of Israel allotted to them.

## Joshua 14:2

Their inheritances were assigned by lot to the nine and a half tribes, as the Lord had commanded through Moses.

## Joshua 14:3

Moses had granted the two and a half tribes their inheritance east of the Jordan, but he had not given the Levites a share among them.

## Joshua 14:4

For the descendants of Joseph had become two tribes—Manasseh and Ephraim. The Levites received no share of the land itself, but only towns to live in, with pasturelands for their flocks and herds.

## Joshua 14:5

So the Israelites did as the Lord had commanded Moses, and they divided the land.

## Joshua 14:6

Now the people of Judah approached Joshua at Gilgal, and Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, “You know what the Lord said to Moses the man of God at Kadesh Barnea about you and me.

## Joshua 14:7

I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land, and I brought back a report according to what was in my heart.

## Joshua 14:8

But my fellow spies who went up with me made the hearts of the people melt with fear. I, however, followed the Lord my God wholeheartedly.

## Joshua 14:9

So on that day Moses swore to me, ‘The land on which your feet have walked will be your inheritance and that of your children forever, because you have followed the Lord my God wholeheartedly.’

## Joshua 14:10

Now then, just as the Lord promised, He has kept me alive for forty-five years since He said this to Moses—while Israel moved about in the wilderness. So here I am today, eighty-five years old.

## Joshua 14:11

I am still as strong today as the day Moses sent me out; I’m just as vigorous to go out to battle now as I was then.

## Joshua 14:12

Now give me this hill country that the Lord promised me that day. You yourself heard then that the Anakim were there and their cities were large and fortified, but the Lord will help me drive them out, just as He said.”

## Joshua 14:13

Then Joshua blessed Caleb son of Jephunneh and gave him Hebron as his inheritance.

## Joshua 14:14

So Hebron has belonged to Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite ever since, because he followed the Lord, the God of Israel, wholeheartedly.

## Joshua 14:15

(Hebron used to be called Kiriath Arba after Arba, who was the greatest man among the Anakim.)  
Then the land had rest from war.
