# Joshua Chapter 14

## Joshua 14:1
These are the territories which the Israelites inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the tribal clans of Israel apportioned to them as inheritances.

## Joshua 14:2
Their inheritances were distributed by lot, as the Lord had commanded through Moses, for the nine tribes and the half-tribe.

## Joshua 14:3
For Moses had given the inheritance to the two tribes and the half-tribe east of the Jordan; but he did not grant an inheritance to the Levites among them.

## Joshua 14:4
Joseph’s descendants formed two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim. The Levites were not given a portion of the land, except cities to live in, with pasturelands for their livestock and possessions.

## Joshua 14:5
The Israelites did as the Lord had commanded Moses, and they divided the land.

## Joshua 14:6
Then the people of Judah came to Joshua at Gilgal, and Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, “You know the word the Lord spoke to Moses the man of God concerning you and me at Kadesh Barnea.

## Joshua 14:7
I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh Barnea to explore the land, and I brought back a report according to my convictions.

## Joshua 14:8
But my fellow Israelites who went up with me made the hearts of the people melt with fear. However, I followed the Lord my God wholeheartedly.

## Joshua 14:9
So on that day Moses swore to me, ‘The land on which your feet have walked shall be your inheritance and that of your children forever, because you have followed the Lord my God wholeheartedly.’

## Joshua 14:10
And now, behold, the Lord has kept me alive, just as He promised, these forty-five years since the Lord spoke this to Moses, while Israel was in the wilderness. Now here I am today, eighty-five years old!

## Joshua 14:11
I am still as strong today as I was on the day Moses sent me out; my strength now is as it was then, for battle and for going out and coming in.

## Joshua 14:12
Now give me this hill country that the Lord promised me that day. You heard then that the Anakites were there, with large fortified cities, but with the Lord’s help, I will drive them out as He said.”

## Joshua 14:13
Joshua then blessed Caleb son of Jephunneh and granted him Hebron as his inheritance.

## Joshua 14:14
Therefore, Hebron has belonged to Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite ever since, because he followed the Lord, the God of Israel, wholeheartedly.

## Joshua 14:15
Now the name of Hebron was previously Kiriath Arba; Arba was the greatest man among the Anakites. Then the land had rest from war.
