# Joshua Chapter 20

## Joshua 20:1

Then the Lord said to Joshua,

## Joshua 20:2

“Tell the Israelites to designate the cities of refuge, as I instructed you through Moses,

## Joshua 20:3

so that anyone who kills a person unintentionally and without premeditation may flee there and find protection from the avenger of blood.

## Joshua 20:4

When someone flees to one of these cities, they are to stand at the entrance of the city gate and present their case before the elders of that city. They are to be admitted into the city and given a place to live among them.

## Joshua 20:5

If the avenger of blood pursues them, the elders must not hand them over, because they killed their neighbour unintentionally and without prior hatred.

## Joshua 20:6

They must stay in that city until they have stood trial before the assembly and until the death of the high priest who is serving at that time. Then they may return to their own home, to the town from which they fled.”

## Joshua 20:7

So they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali,  
Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim,  
and Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron) in the hill country of Judah.

## Joshua 20:8

And across the Jordan east of Jericho, they designated:  
Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau from the tribe of Reuben,  
Ramoth in Gilead from the tribe of Gad,  
and Golan in Bashan from the tribe of Manasseh.

## Joshua 20:9

These were the appointed cities for all the Israelites and for any foreigner residing among them, so that anyone who killed another unintentionally could flee there and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood before standing trial before the assembly.
