# Joshua Chapter 20

## Joshua 20:1

Then the Lord addressed Joshua, saying,

## Joshua 20:2

“Speak to the Israelites, instructing them to appoint the cities of refuge, as I directed you through Moses,

## Joshua 20:3

so that anyone who kills a person unintentionally and without prior intent may flee there and find sanctuary from the avenger of blood.

---

## Joshua 20:4

When they flee to one of these cities, they must stand at the entrance of the city gate and present their case to the elders of that city. The elders shall then admit the fugitive into the city and provide them with a place to live among them.

## Joshua 20:5

If the avenger of blood pursues them, the elders must not hand over the one who committed manslaughter, as they killed their neighbour unintentionally and without prior malice.

## Joshua 20:6

They shall remain in that city until they have stood trial before the assembly, and until the death of the high priest serving at that time. After that, they may return to their own home in the town from which they fled.”

## Joshua 20:7

Thus they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali, Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath Arba (which is Hebron) in the hill country of Judah.

## Joshua 20:8

And across the Jordan east of Jericho, they appointed Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau from the tribe of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead from the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan from the tribe of Manasseh.

## Joshua 20:9

These were the designated cities for all the Israelites and any foreigner residing among them, so that anyone who kills a person unintentionally could flee there and not be killed by the avenger of blood before standing trial before the assembly.
