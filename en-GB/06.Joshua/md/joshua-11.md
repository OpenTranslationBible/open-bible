# Joshua Chapter 11

## Joshua 11:1

When Jabin king of Hazor heard of this, he sent word to Jobab king of Madon, to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,

## Joshua 11:2

and to the northern kings in the hill country, in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, in the lowlands, and on the heights of Dor on the west;

## Joshua 11:3

to the Canaanites on the east and west, the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, and Jebusites in the hill country, and to the Hivites below Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.

## Joshua 11:4

They came out with all their armies, as numerous as the sand on the seashore, with a great many horses and chariots.

## Joshua 11:5

All these kings joined forces and camped together at the Waters of Merom to fight against Israel.

## Joshua 11:6

The Lord said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid of them, for by this time tomorrow I will deliver all of them slain into Israel’s hands. You are to hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire.”

## Joshua 11:7

So Joshua and all his warriors came upon them suddenly at the Waters of Merom and attacked them.

## Joshua 11:8

And the Lord delivered them into the hands of Israel. They defeated them and pursued them as far as Great Sidon, Misrephoth-maim, and the Valley of Mizpeh to the east, until no survivors were left.

## Joshua 11:9

Joshua did to them as the Lord had instructed: he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire.

## Joshua 11:10

At that time Joshua turned back and captured Hazor, striking its king with the sword, for Hazor had been the head of all these kingdoms.

## Joshua 11:11

They struck all the people who were in it with the sword, utterly destroying them, leaving no one who breathed, and he burned Hazor with fire.

## Joshua 11:12

Joshua captured all these royal cities and their kings and struck them with the sword, utterly destroying them, as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded.

## Joshua 11:13

However, Israel did not burn any of the cities built on their mounds, except Hazor, which Joshua burned.

## Joshua 11:14

The Israelites took all the spoils and livestock of these cities as their plunder, but they struck every person with the sword until they had destroyed them, leaving no one breathing.

## Joshua 11:15

As the Lord had commanded His servant Moses, so Moses commanded Joshua, and Joshua did it; he left nothing undone of all that the Lord commanded Moses.

## Joshua 11:16

So Joshua took all this land: the hill country, all the Negev, the whole region of Goshen, the lowlands, the Arabah, and the mountains of Israel with their lowlands,

## Joshua 11:17

from Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir, to Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon below Mount Hermon. He captured all their kings and put them to death.

## Joshua 11:18

Joshua engaged in conflict with all these kings for an extended period.

## Joshua 11:19

Except for the Hivites living in Gibeon, not a single city made peace with the Israelites; they took them all in battle.

## Joshua 11:20

For it was the Lord’s doing to harden their hearts to wage war against Israel, so that He might utterly destroy them, exterminating them without mercy, as the Lord had commanded Moses.

## Joshua 11:21

At that time Joshua came and eliminated the Anakim from the hill country: from Hebron, Debir, Anab, from all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country of Israel. Joshua utterly destroyed them and their cities.

## Joshua 11:22

No Anakim were left in Israelite territory; only in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod did any survive.

---

## Joshua 11:23

So Joshua took the whole land, just as the Lord had spoken to Moses, and he gave it as an inheritance to Israel according to their tribal divisions. Then the land had rest from war.
