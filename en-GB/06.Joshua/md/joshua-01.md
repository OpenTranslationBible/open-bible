# Joshua Chapter 1

## Joshua 1:1

After the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, the Lord spoke to Joshua son of Nun, who had served Moses faithfully.

---

## Joshua 1:2

“Moses My servant is dead. Now then, get ready to cross the Jordan River—you and all this people—into the land that I am giving to them, the Israelites.

---

## Joshua 1:3

Every place where you set your foot, I have given to you, just as I promised Moses.

---

## Joshua 1:4

Your territory will extend from the wilderness and Lebanon to the great river, the Euphrates—all the land of the Hittites—and as far as the Mediterranean Sea in the west.

---

## Joshua 1:5

No one will be able to stand against you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will never leave you nor forsake you.

---

## Joshua 1:6

Be strong and courageous, for you will lead these people to inherit the land I swore to their ancestors to give them.

---

## Joshua 1:7

Only be strong and very courageous. Be careful to live according to all the law that My servant Moses commanded you. Do not turn from it to the right or to the left, so that you may prosper wherever you go.

---

## Joshua 1:8

Keep this Book of the Law always on your lips. Meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will succeed and be prosperous.

---

## Joshua 1:9

Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.”

---

Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people,

---

## Joshua 1:11

“Go through the camp and tell the people, ‘Prepare your provisions, for within three days you will cross the Jordan to go in and take possession of the land the Lord your God is giving you.’”

---

## Joshua 1:12

But to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said,

---

## Joshua 1:13

“Remember what Moses, the servant of the Lord, commanded you: ‘The Lord your God is giving you rest and has granted you this land.’

---

## Joshua 1:14

Your wives, children, and livestock may stay in the land that Moses gave you east of the Jordan, but all your fighting men, fully armed, must cross ahead of your fellow Israelites and help them.

---

## Joshua 1:15

Until the Lord gives rest to your fellow Israelites as He has to you, and until they too have taken possession of the land the Lord your God is giving them. After that, you may return and occupy your own land, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you on the east side of the Jordan.”

---

## Joshua 1:16

Then they answered Joshua, “Whatever you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.

---

## Joshua 1:17

Just as we fully obeyed Moses, so we will obey you. Only may the Lord your God be with you as He was with Moses.

---

## Joshua 1:18

Anyone who rebels against your word and does not obey whatever you command will be put to death. Only be strong and courageous.”
