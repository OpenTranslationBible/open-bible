# Joshua Chapter 1

## Joshua 1:1

Following the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, the Lord spoke to Joshua son of Nun, who had served Moses, saying,

## Joshua 1:2

“Moses, my servant, is dead. Now, therefore, arise, you and all these people, and cross the Jordan River into the land I am about to give to the Israelites.

## Joshua 1:3

Every place where the sole of your foot treads, I have granted to you, just as I promised to Moses.

## Joshua 1:4

Your territory will extend from the wilderness and Lebanon to the great river, the Euphrates—all the land of the Hittites—and to the Great Sea on the west.

## Joshua 1:5

No one will be able to stand against you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will not leave you nor forsake you.

## Joshua 1:6

Be strong and courageous, for you shall lead these people to inherit the land I swore to their ancestors to give them.

## Joshua 1:7

Only be strong and very courageous; be careful to act according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded you; do not turn from it to the right or to the left, so that you may succeed wherever you go.

## Joshua 1:8

This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth; you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it. Then you will make your way prosperous and achieve success.

## Joshua 1:9

Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be frightened or dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.”

## Joshua 1:10

So Joshua commanded the officers of the people,

## Joshua 1:11

“Pass through the camp and instruct the people, ‘Prepare your provisions, for in three days you will cross the Jordan to take possession of the land the Lord your God is giving you.’”

## Joshua 1:12

Joshua addressed the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh,

## Joshua 1:13

“Remember the command that Moses, the servant of the Lord, gave you: ‘The Lord your God is providing you a place of rest and will give you this land.’

## Joshua 1:14

Your wives, children, and livestock may remain in the land Moses gave you east of the Jordan, but all your fighting men, ready for battle, must cross over ahead of your fellow Israelites and help them,

## Joshua 1:15

until the Lord gives them rest, as He has given you, and they too have taken possession of the land the Lord your God is giving them. After that, you may return to occupy your own land, which Moses the servant of the Lord gave you east of the Jordan toward the sunrise.”

## Joshua 1:16

They responded to Joshua, “We will do all that you have instructed us, and we will go wherever you send us.

## Joshua 1:17

Just as we obeyed Moses in everything, so we will obey you. Only may the Lord your God be with you as He was with Moses.

## Joshua 1:18

Anyone who rebels against your command and does not obey your words in everything you command, shall be put to death. Only be strong and courageous!”
