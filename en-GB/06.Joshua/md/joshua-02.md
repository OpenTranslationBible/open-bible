# Joshua Chapter 2

## Joshua 2:1
Then Joshua the son of Nun sent two men as spies secretly from Shittim, instructing them, “Go and explore the land, especially Jericho.” They went and entered the house of a prostitute named Rahab, where they stayed.

## Joshua 2:2
The king of Jericho was informed, “Behold, some men from the Israelites have come here tonight to spy out the land.”

## Joshua 2:3
So the king of Jericho sent a message to Rahab, saying, “Bring out the men who have come to you and entered your house, for they have come to spy out the entire land.”

## Joshua 2:4
But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them. She replied, “Yes, the men did come to me, but I did not know where they were from.

## Joshua 2:5
At dusk, when it was time to close the city gate, they left. I do not know which way they went. Pursue them quickly, for you may overtake them.”

## Joshua 2:6
(However, she had taken them up to the roof and hidden them under the stalks of flax she had laid out on the roof.)

## Joshua 2:7
So the men pursued them along the road to the fords of the Jordan, and as soon as the pursuers had gone out, the gate was shut.

## Joshua 2:8
Before the spies lay down for the night, she went up to them on the roof

## Joshua 2:9
and said to them, “I know that the Lord has given you this land and that a great fear of you has fallen upon us, so that all the inhabitants of the land are in despair because of you.

## Joshua 2:10
We have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to Sihon and Og, the two kings of the Amorites beyond the Jordan, whom you completely destroyed.

## Joshua 2:11
When we heard of it, our hearts melted in fear and no courage remained in anyone any longer because of you, for the Lord your God is God in heaven above and on the earth below.

## Joshua 2:12
“Now then, please swear to me by the Lord that you will show kindness to my family, as I have shown kindness to you. Give me a sure sign

## Joshua 2:13
that you will spare the lives of my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them, and save us from death.”

## Joshua 2:14
The men assured her, “Our lives for yours! If you do not disclose this matter of ours, we will treat you kindly and faithfully when the Lord gives us the land.”

## Joshua 2:15
Then she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house was part of the city wall, so she lived on the wall.

## Joshua 2:16
She advised them, “Go to the hills so the pursuers will not find you. Hide there for three days until they return, and then go on your way.”

## Joshua 2:17
The men said to her, “This oath you made us swear will not be binding on us

## Joshua 2:18
unless, when we enter the land, you have tied this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down, and have gathered your father, mother, brothers, and all your family into your house.

## Joshua 2:19
If any of them go outside your house into the street, their blood will be on their own heads; we will not be responsible. But if anyone is harmed who is with you in the house, their blood will be on our head.

## Joshua 2:20
But if you disclose this matter of ours, we will be released from the oath you made us swear.”

## Joshua 2:21
She agreed, “Let it be as you say.” So she sent them away, and they departed. She then tied the scarlet cord in the window.

## Joshua 2:22
When they left, they went to the hills and stayed there for three days, until the pursuers had searched all along the road and returned without finding them.

## Joshua 2:23
Then the two men returned, descended from the hills, crossed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun. They reported to him all that had happened to them.

## Joshua 2:24
They said to Joshua, “The Lord has surely given the entire land into our hands; all the people are in despair because of us.”
