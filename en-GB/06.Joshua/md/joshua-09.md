# Joshua Chapter 9

## Joshua 9:1

Now when all the kings beyond the Jordan heard of these events—in the hill country, the lowland, and along the entire coast of the Great Sea towards Lebanon, including the kings of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites—

## Joshua 9:2

they gathered together with a single purpose: to fight against Joshua and Israel.

---

## Joshua 9:3

But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai,

## Joshua 9:4

they acted with cunning and set out with provisions, loading their donkeys with worn-out sacks and old wineskins, cracked and repaired.

## Joshua 9:5

They wore old and patched sandals on their feet and dressed in worn-out clothes. All their bread was dry and crumbled.

## Joshua 9:6

They went to Joshua at the camp at Gilgal and said to him and the Israelites, “We have come from a distant country; now make a covenant with us.”

## Joshua 9:7

The Israelites said to the Hivites, “Perhaps you live near us; how then can we make a covenant with you?”

## Joshua 9:8

They replied to Joshua, “We are your servants.” Joshua asked them, “Who are you and where do you come from?”

## Joshua 9:9

They answered, “Your servants have come from a very distant country because of the renown of the Lord your God, for we have heard reports of all that He did in Egypt,

## Joshua 9:10

and all that He did to the two kings of the Amorites beyond the Jordan—Sihon king of Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth.

## Joshua 9:11

Our elders and all the inhabitants of our country said to us, ‘Take provisions for the journey and go to meet them. Say to them, “We are your servants; make a covenant with us.”’

## Joshua 9:12

This bread of ours was warm when we packed it on the day we left to come to you, but now see how dry and crumbled it is.

## Joshua 9:13

And these wineskins we filled were new, but see how they are split open; and our clothes and sandals are worn out from the very long journey.”

## Joshua 9:14

The Israelites sampled their provisions but did not seek the counsel of the Lord.

## Joshua 9:15

Then Joshua made peace with them and established a covenant to let them live, and the leaders of the assembly ratified it by oath.

## Joshua 9:16

Three days after they made the covenant with the Gibeonites, the Israelites learned that they were neighbours, living among them.

## Joshua 9:17

The Israelites set out and on the third day reached their cities: Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim.

## Joshua 9:18

But the Israelites did not attack them, because the leaders of the assembly had sworn an oath to them by the Lord, the God of Israel. The entire assembly grumbled against the leaders,

## Joshua 9:19

but all the leaders said to the assembly, “We have sworn to them by the Lord, the God of Israel, and now we cannot harm them.

## Joshua 9:20

This is what we will do: let them live, so that wrath will not fall upon us for breaking the oath we swore to them.”

## Joshua 9:21

They continued, “Let them live, but let them be woodcutters and water carriers for the entire assembly.” Thus the leaders’ promise to them was upheld.

## Joshua 9:22

Then Joshua summoned the Gibeonites and said, “Why did you deceive us by claiming, ‘We live far from you,’ when you actually dwell among us?

## Joshua 9:23

Now you are under a curse: you will never cease to serve as woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God.”

## Joshua 9:24

They answered Joshua, “Your servants were clearly informed that the Lord your God commanded His servant Moses to give you all the land and to destroy all its inhabitants before you. So we feared greatly for our lives because of you, and that is why we acted this way.

## Joshua 9:25

Now we are in your hands. Do to us whatever you think is good and right.”

## Joshua 9:26

So Joshua saved them from the Israelites, and they did not kill them.

## Joshua 9:27

That day he made the Gibeonites woodcutters and water carriers for the assembly and for the altar of the Lord, at the place He would choose. And that is what they are to this day.
