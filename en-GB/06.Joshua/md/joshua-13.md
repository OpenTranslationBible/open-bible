# Joshua Chapter 13

## Joshua 13:1
Joshua was now old and advanced in years when the Lord said to him, “You are old and advanced in years, and there remains a substantial portion of the land to be possessed.

## Joshua 13:2
This is the land that remains: all the regions of the Philistines and the Geshurites;

## Joshua 13:3
from the Shihor, which is east of Egypt, to the territory of Ekron to the north, which is considered Canaanite; the five rulers of the Philistines: the Gazite, the Ashdodite, the Ashkelonite, the Gittite, the Ekronite; and the Avvite

## Joshua 13:4
to the south; all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that belongs to the Sidonians, as far as Aphek, to the border of the Amorites;

## Joshua 13:5
and the land of the Gebalite, and all of Lebanon towards the east, from Baal-gad below Mount Hermon to Lebo-hamath.

## Joshua 13:6
All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim, all the Sidonians, I will drive out from before the Israelites; only allot it to Israel as an inheritance as I have commanded you.

## Joshua 13:7
Now therefore, apportion this land as an inheritance among the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh.”

## Joshua 13:8
With the other half-tribe, the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance which Moses gave them east of the Jordan, just as Moses, the servant of the Lord, had given them;

## Joshua 13:9
from Aroer, which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon, with the city in the middle of the valley, and all the plain of Medeba as far as Dibon;

## Joshua 13:10
and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, as far as the border of the Ammonites;

## Joshua 13:11
and Gilead, and the territory of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan as far as Salecah;

## Joshua 13:12
all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei (he was the last of the Rephaim); for Moses defeated them and took over their land.

## Joshua 13:13
But the Israelites did not drive out the Geshurites or the Maacathites; thus, Geshur and Maacath live among Israel to this day.

## Joshua 13:14
Only to the tribe of Levi he did not give an inheritance; the offerings by fire to the Lord, the God of Israel, are their inheritance, as He promised them.

## Joshua 13:15
So Moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of the sons of Reuben according to their families:

## Joshua 13:16
Their territory was from Aroer, which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon, with the city in the middle of the valley, and all the plain by Medeba;

## Joshua 13:17
Heshbon and all its cities which are on the plain: Dibon, Bamoth-baal, Beth-baal-meon,

## Joshua 13:18
Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath,

## Joshua 13:19
Kiriathaim, Sibmah, Zereth-shahar on the hill of the valley,

## Joshua 13:20
Beth-peor, the slopes of Pisgah, Beth-jeshimoth,

## Joshua 13:21
all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses struck with the leaders of Midian, Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, the leaders of Sihon, who lived in the land.

## Joshua 13:22
The Israelites also killed Balaam son of Beor, who practised divination, with the sword among the rest of their dead.

## Joshua 13:23
The border of the Reubenites was the Jordan. This was the inheritance of the sons of Reuben according to their families, the cities and their villages.

## Joshua 13:24
Moses also gave an inheritance to the tribe of Gad, to the sons of Gad according to their families.

## Joshua 13:25
Their territory was Jazer and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the sons of Ammon, as far as Aroer, which is opposite Rabbah;

## Joshua 13:26
and from Heshbon as far as Ramath-mizpeh and Betonim, and from Mahanaim as far as the border of Debir;

## Joshua 13:27
and in the valley, Beth-haram, Beth-nimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, with the Jordan as a border, as far as the lower end of the Sea of Chinnereth beyond the Jordan to the east.

## Joshua 13:28
This is the inheritance of the sons of Gad according to their families, the cities and their villages.

## Joshua 13:29
Moses also gave an inheritance to the half-tribe of Manasseh; it was for the half-tribe of the sons of Manasseh according to their families.

## Joshua 13:30
Their territory was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, sixty cities;

## Joshua 13:31
also half of Gilead, with Ashtaroth and Edrei, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were for the sons of Machir son of Manasseh, for half of the sons of Machir according to their families.

## Joshua 13:32
These are the territories which Moses apportioned as an inheritance in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan at Jericho to the east.

## Joshua 13:33
But to the tribe of Levi, Moses did not give an inheritance; the Lord, the God of Israel, is their inheritance, as He had promised them.
