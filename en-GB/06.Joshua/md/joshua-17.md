# Joshua Chapter 17

## Joshua 17:1

This was the allotment for the tribe of Manasseh, the firstborn of Joseph:  
To Makir, the firstborn of Manasseh and the father of Gilead—who was a man of war—were given Gilead and Bashan.

## Joshua 17:2

So the allotment was made for the rest of the tribe of Manasseh, according to their clans—for the descendants of Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida. These were the male descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph by their clans.

## Joshua 17:3

Now Zelophehad son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Makir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons but only daughters. Their names were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milkah, and Tirzah.

## Joshua 17:4

They approached Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the leaders, and said, “The Lord commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our relatives.” So Joshua gave them an inheritance among the uncles of their father, in accordance with the Lord’s command.

## Joshua 17:5

Manasseh’s share consisted of ten portions in addition to Gilead and Bashan, which lay east of the Jordan,

## Joshua 17:6

because the daughters of the tribe of Manasseh received an inheritance along with the sons. The land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the descendants of Manasseh.

## Joshua 17:7

The boundary of Manasseh went from Asher to Mikmethath, east of Shechem. The boundary then ran southward to include the people living at En Tappuah.

## Joshua 17:8

The land of Tappuah itself belonged to Manasseh, but Tappuah, on the border of Manasseh, belonged to the descendants of Ephraim.

## Joshua 17:9

Then the boundary descended to the Kanah Ravine, south of the ravine. Towns belonging to Ephraim were among those of Manasseh, but the boundary of Manasseh was on the north side of the ravine and ended at the sea.

## Joshua 17:10

The land on the south belonged to Ephraim and that on the north to Manasseh. The sea was their boundary. They touched Asher on the north and Issachar on the east.

## Joshua 17:11

Within Issachar and Asher, Manasseh also had Beth Shan, Ibleam, and the people of Dor, Endor, Taanach, and Megiddo—each with their surrounding settlements.

## Joshua 17:12

Yet the descendants of Manasseh were not able to drive out the people of those cities, and the Canaanites persisted in living there.

## Joshua 17:13

However, when the Israelites grew strong, they subjected the Canaanites to forced labour but did not drive them out completely.

## Joshua 17:14

The descendants of Joseph said to Joshua, “Why have you given us only one allotment and one portion for an inheritance? We are a numerous people, and the Lord has blessed us greatly.”

## Joshua 17:15

Joshua replied, “If you are so numerous, and the hill country of Ephraim is too small for you, go up into the forest and clear land for yourselves there in the territory of the Perizzites and Rephaim.”

## Joshua 17:16

The descendants of Joseph said, “The hill country is not enough for us, and all the Canaanites who live in the plain have chariots fitted with iron—both those in Beth Shan and its settlements and those in the Valley of Jezreel.”

---

## Joshua 17:17

But Joshua said to the tribes of Joseph—to Ephraim and Manasseh—“You are numerous and very powerful. You will not have only one allotment.

## Joshua 17:18

The forested hill country will also be yours. Clear it, and its farthest limits will be yours. Although the Canaanites have chariots fitted with iron and though they are strong, you can drive them out.”
