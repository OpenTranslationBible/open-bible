After three days, the officers went through the camp

## Joshua 3:3

and commanded the people: “When you see the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God, carried by the Levitical priests, you must set out from your place and follow it.

---

## Joshua 3:4

But keep a distance of about two thousand cubits between you and the ark. Do not go near it, so that you may know the way you should go, for you have not passed this way before.”

---

## Joshua 3:5

Then Joshua told the people, “Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you.”

---

## Joshua 3:6

And Joshua said to the priests, “Take up the ark of the covenant and go ahead of the people.”  
So they took it up and went before them.

## Joshua 3:7

The Lord said to Joshua, “Today I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, so that they may know that just as I was with Moses, so I will be with you.

---

## Joshua 3:8

Give this command to the priests who carry the ark of the covenant: ‘When you reach the edge of the waters of the Jordan, stand still in the river.’”

---

Then Joshua said to the Israelites, “Come here and listen to the words of the Lord your God.”

---

## Joshua 3:10

He continued, “This is how you will know that the living God is among you and that He will certainly drive out before you the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites, and Jebusites.

Look, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth will go ahead of you into the Jordan.

## Joshua 3:12

Now then, choose twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one from each tribe.

## Joshua 3:13

And when the soles of the feet of the priests carrying the ark of the Lord—the Lord of all the earth—rest in the waters of the Jordan, its waters will be cut off. The water flowing downstream will stand in a heap.”

## Joshua 3:14

So when the people broke camp to cross the Jordan, the priests carrying the ark of the covenant went ahead of them.

## Joshua 3:15

Now the Jordan overflows its banks throughout the harvest season. But as soon as the priests who carried the ark reached the Jordan and their feet touched the edge of the water,

---

## Joshua 3:16

the water flowing down from upstream stopped. It stood still, rising up in a heap a great distance away at a town called Adam, near Zarethan. The water flowing down to the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea) was completely cut off. So the people crossed opposite Jericho.

## Joshua 3:17

The priests carrying the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood firmly on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan while all Israel passed through on dry ground, until the entire nation had finished crossing the Jordan.
