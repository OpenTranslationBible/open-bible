# Joshua Chapter 3

## Joshua 3:1
Joshua rose early in the morning, and he and all the Israelites set out from Shittim and arrived at the Jordan, where they lodged before crossing over.

## Joshua 3:2
At the end of three days, the officers went throughout the camp;

## Joshua 3:3
and they instructed the people, saying, “When you see the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God, carried by the Levitical priests, you shall set out from your place and follow it.

## Joshua 3:4
Yet there shall be a distance of about two thousand cubits between you and it. Do not go near it, so that you may know the way you should go, for you have not passed this way before.”

## Joshua 3:5
Joshua then said to the people, “Sanctify yourselves, for tomorrow the Lord will perform wonders among you.”

## Joshua 3:6
And Joshua said to the priests, “Take up the ark of the covenant and proceed ahead of the people.” So they took up the ark and went before the people.

## Joshua 3:7
The Lord said to Joshua, “This day I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, so they may know that as I was with Moses, so I will be with you.

## Joshua 3:8
You shall command the priests who carry the ark of the covenant, saying, ‘When you reach the edge of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan.’”

## Joshua 3:9
Joshua said to the Israelites, “Come here and listen to the words of the Lord your God.”

## Joshua 3:10
And Joshua said, “By this you shall know that the living God is among you, and that He will surely drive out before you the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites, and Jebusites.

## Joshua 3:11
Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is going ahead of you into the Jordan.

## Joshua 3:12
Now therefore, select twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one man from each tribe.

## Joshua 3:13
And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests who carry the ark of the Lord, the Lord of all the earth, rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters flowing downstream will be cut off and stand up in a heap.”

## Joshua 3:14
When the people set out from their tents to cross the Jordan, with the priests carrying the ark of the covenant before them,

## Joshua 3:15
and as the priests carrying the ark reached the Jordan and their feet dipped into the edge of the water (for the Jordan overflows all its banks during the harvest),

## Joshua 3:16
the waters flowing from upstream stopped and rose up in a heap a great distance away, at a town called Adam, near Zarethan, while the waters flowing down to the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, were completely cut off. So the people crossed over opposite Jericho.

## Joshua 3:17
The priests carrying the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan, while all Israel crossed over on dry ground, until the whole nation had completed the crossing.
