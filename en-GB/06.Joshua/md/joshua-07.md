# Joshua Chapter 7

## Joshua 7:1

But the Israelites acted unfaithfully concerning the things set apart for destruction, as Achan, son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, took some of these items. Thus, the Lord’s anger burned against the Israelites.

## Joshua 7:2

Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth-aven, east of Bethel, and instructed them, “Go up and scout the land.” So the men went up and explored Ai.

## Joshua 7:3

Upon their return to Joshua, they reported, “Not all the people need to go up; send about two or three thousand men to attack Ai. Do not trouble the whole army, for the inhabitants are few.”

## Joshua 7:4

Approximately three thousand men went up, but they were put to flight by the men of Ai.

## Joshua 7:5

The men of Ai struck down about thirty-six of them, chasing them from the city gate to the stone quarries and striking them down on the slopes. The hearts of the people melted and became like water.

## Joshua 7:6

Joshua tore his clothes and fell face down to the ground before the ark of the Lord until evening, along with the elders of Israel, who also put dust on their heads.

## Joshua 7:7

Joshua lamented, “Alas, Sovereign Lord, why did you bring this people across the Jordan, only to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us? If only we had been content to dwell on the other side of the Jordan!

## Joshua 7:8

Pardon me, Lord. What can I say now that Israel has turned its back before its enemies?

## Joshua 7:9

The Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of this, and they will surround us and wipe out our name from the earth. What then will you do for your great name?”

## Joshua 7:10

The Lord addressed Joshua, saying, “Rise up! Why are you lying on your face?

## Joshua 7:11

Israel has sinned; they have violated my covenant, which I commanded them. They have taken some of the things set apart for destruction; they have stolen, lied, and put them among their own belongings.

## Joshua 7:12

That is why the Israelites cannot stand against their enemies; they turn their backs and flee because they have become liable to destruction. I will not be with you anymore unless you remove from among you what is set apart for destruction.

## Joshua 7:13

“Go, consecrate the people. Tell them, ‘Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, for this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: There are things set apart for destruction among you, Israel. You cannot stand against your enemies until you remove them.

## Joshua 7:14

“‘In the morning, present yourselves tribe by tribe. The tribe the Lord selects shall come forward clan by clan; the clan the Lord selects shall come forward family by family; and the family the Lord selects shall come forward man by man.

## Joshua 7:15

The one who is caught with the things set apart for destruction shall be burned with fire, along with all that belongs to him, because he has violated the Lord’s covenant and has committed a disgraceful act in Israel.’”

## Joshua 7:16

Early the next morning, Joshua had Israel come forward by tribes, and the tribe of Judah was selected.

## Joshua 7:17

The clans of Judah came forward, and the Zerahites were selected. He had the clan of the Zerahites come forward man by man, and Zabdi was selected.

## Joshua 7:18

Joshua had his household come forward man by man, and Achan, son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, was selected.

## Joshua 7:19

Then Joshua addressed Achan, “My son, give praise to the Lord, the God of Israel, and honour him. Tell me what you have done; do not hide it from me.”

## Joshua 7:20

Achan replied, “Indeed, I have sinned against the Lord, the God of Israel. This is what I did:

## Joshua 7:21

When I saw among the spoils a beautiful robe from Shinar, two hundred shekels of silver, and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels, I coveted them and took them. They are hidden in the ground inside my tent, with the silver underneath.”

## Joshua 7:22

Joshua then dispatched his messengers, they hurried to his tent; and there they found the items, hidden in the tent, with the silver underneath.

## Joshua 7:23

They took the items from the tent, brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites, and laid them out before the Lord.

## Joshua 7:24

Then Joshua, together with all Israel, took Achan son of Zerah, the silver, the robe, the gold bar, his sons and daughters, his cattle, donkeys, sheep, his tent, and all that he had, to the Valley of Achor.

## Joshua 7:25

Joshua said, “Why have you brought trouble upon us? The Lord will bring trouble upon you today.” Then all Israel stoned him, and after they had stoned the rest, they burned them with fire.

## Joshua 7:26

Over Achan they raised a large heap of stones, which remains to this day. Then the Lord turned from his fierce anger. Therefore, that place has been called the Valley of Achor to this day.
