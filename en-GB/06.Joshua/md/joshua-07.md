# Joshua Chapter 7

## Joshua 7:1

But the Israelites acted unfaithfully regarding the things set apart for destruction. Achan son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of the devoted items. So the Lord’s anger burned against the Israelites.

## Joshua 7:2

Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth Aven to the east of Bethel, and told them, “Go up and spy out the land.” So the men went up and spied out Ai.

---

## Joshua 7:3

When they returned to Joshua, they said, “Not all the people will need to go up. About two or three thousand men can attack Ai; do not trouble all the people there, for they are few.”

---

## Joshua 7:4

So about three thousand men went up, but they were driven back by the men of Ai,

## Joshua 7:5

who struck down about thirty-six of them. They chased the Israelites from the city gate as far as Shebarim and struck them down on the slopes. At this the hearts of the people melted and became like water.

---

## Joshua 7:6

Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell facedown to the ground before the ark of the Lord, remaining there until evening, along with the elders of Israel. They put dust on their heads.

---

## Joshua 7:7

Joshua said, “Alas, Sovereign Lord, why did You bring this people across the Jordan only to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us? If only we had been content to stay on the other side of the Jordan!

---

## Joshua 7:8

Pardon me, Lord, what can I say, now that Israel has been routed by its enemies?

---

## Joshua 7:9

The Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it. They will surround us and wipe out our name from the earth. What then will You do for the honour of Your great name?”

---

## Joshua 7:10

The Lord said to Joshua, “Stand up! Why have you fallen facedown?

---

## Joshua 7:11

Israel has sinned; they have violated My covenant, which I commanded them to keep. They have taken some of the devoted things; they have stolen, they have lied, and they have put them with their own possessions.

---

## Joshua 7:12

That is why the Israelites cannot stand against their enemies; they turn their backs and run because they have become liable to destruction. I will not be with you anymore unless you remove whatever is devoted to destruction from among you.

---

## Joshua 7:13

Go, consecrate the people. Tell them, ‘Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, for this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: There are things set apart among you, Israel. You cannot stand against your enemies until you remove them.

---

## Joshua 7:14

In the morning, present yourselves tribe by tribe. The tribe the Lord selects shall come forward clan by clan, then the clan the Lord selects shall come forward family by family, and the family the Lord selects shall come forward man by man.

---

## Joshua 7:15

Whoever is caught with the devoted things shall be destroyed by fire, along with all that he has, because he has broken the covenant of the Lord and has committed a disgraceful thing in Israel.’”

---

## Joshua 7:16

Early the next morning Joshua had Israel come forward by tribes, and the tribe of Judah was selected.

---

## Joshua 7:17

He had the tribe of Judah come forward by clans, and the Zerahite clan was selected. He had the Zerahite clan come forward by families, and Zabdi was selected.

---

## Joshua 7:18

Then he had Zabdi’s family come forward man by man, and Achan son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was selected.

---

## Joshua 7:19

Then Joshua said to Achan, “My son, give glory to the Lord, the God of Israel, and honour Him. Tell me what you have done; do not hide it from me.”

---

## Joshua 7:20

Achan replied, “It is true! I have sinned against the Lord, the God of Israel. This is what I did:

---

## Joshua 7:21

When I saw among the plunder a beautiful robe from Babylonia, two hundred shekels of silver, and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels, I coveted them and took them. They are hidden in the ground inside my tent, with the silver underneath.”

---

## Joshua 7:22

So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent. There it was, hidden in the tent, with the silver underneath.

---

## Joshua 7:23

They took the things from the tent, brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites, and laid them out before the Lord.

---

## Joshua 7:24

Then Joshua, together with all Israel, took Achan son of Zerah, the silver, the robe, the gold bar, his sons and daughters, his oxen, donkeys, and sheep, his tent, and all that he had, and brought them to the Valley of Achor.

---

## Joshua 7:25

Joshua said, “Why have you brought trouble upon us? The Lord will bring trouble upon you today.”  
Then all Israel stoned him, and after they had stoned the rest, they burned them.

---

## Joshua 7:26

Over Achan they heaped up a large pile of stones, which remains to this day. Then the Lord turned from His fierce anger.  
Therefore, that place has been called the Valley of Achor ever since.
