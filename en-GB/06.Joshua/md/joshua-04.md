# Joshua Chapter 4

## Joshua 4:1
When the entire nation had completed crossing the Jordan, the Lord spoke to Joshua,

## Joshua 4:2
“Select twelve men from among the people, one man from each tribe,

## Joshua 4:3
and instruct them to take twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, from the spot where the priests are standing firm, and carry them with you to place them at the location where you will stay tonight.”

## Joshua 4:4
So Joshua called the twelve men he had designated from the sons of Israel, one man from each tribe,

## Joshua 4:5
and he said to them, “Proceed before the ark of the Lord your God into the middle of the Jordan, and each of you lift a stone onto his shoulder, corresponding to the number of the tribes of the Israelites.

## Joshua 4:6
This will serve as a sign among you. In the future, when your children ask, ‘What do these stones signify?’

## Joshua 4:7
you shall explain to them, ‘The waters of the Jordan were halted before the ark of the covenant of the Lord. When it crossed the Jordan, the waters were cut off.’ These stones are to be a perpetual memorial for the people of Israel.”

## Joshua 4:8
The Israelites did precisely as Joshua had instructed. They took twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, as the Lord had directed Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites, and they transported them to their encampment, where they placed them.

## Joshua 4:9
Joshua also set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan at the location where the priests carrying the ark of the covenant had stood, and they remain there to this day.

## Joshua 4:10
The priests carrying the ark stood in the middle of the Jordan until everything the Lord had commanded Joshua was completed by the people, following all that Moses had instructed Joshua. The people hurried across,

## Joshua 4:11
and once all had crossed, the ark of the Lord and the priests came to the other side while the people observed.

## Joshua 4:12
The sons of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over in battle formation ahead of the Israelites, as Moses had commanded them.

## Joshua 4:13
Approximately forty thousand armed for battle crossed over before the Lord to the plains of Jericho ready for war.

## Joshua 4:14
On that day, the Lord exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel, and they revered him throughout his life, just as they had revered Moses.

## Joshua 4:15
Then the Lord spoke to Joshua,

## Joshua 4:16
“Command the priests carrying the ark of the covenant law to come up from the Jordan.”

## Joshua 4:17
So Joshua instructed the priests, “Come up from the Jordan.”

## Joshua 4:18
It happened that when the priests carrying the ark of the covenant of the Lord came up from the middle of the Jordan, and their feet touched the dry ground, the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and overflowed its banks as before.

## Joshua 4:19
On the tenth day of the first month, the people came up from the Jordan and camped at Gilgal on the eastern border of Jericho.

## Joshua 4:20
At Gilgal, Joshua erected the twelve stones they had taken from the Jordan.

## Joshua 4:21
He addressed the Israelites, “In the future, when your descendants ask their fathers, ‘What do these stones mean?’

## Joshua 4:22
you shall inform them, ‘Israel crossed the Jordan on dry ground.’

## Joshua 4:23
For the Lord your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you until you had crossed over, just as the Lord your God did to the Red Sea, which He dried up before us until we had crossed.

## Joshua 4:24
He did this so that all the peoples of the earth might recognise that the hand of the Lord is mighty, and so that you may always revere the Lord your God.”
