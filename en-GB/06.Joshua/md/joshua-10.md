# Joshua Chapter 10

## Joshua 10:1

When Adoni-Zedek, the king of Jerusalem, heard that Joshua had captured Ai and utterly destroyed it, just as he had done to Jericho and its king, and that the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were among them,

## Joshua 10:2

he and his people were greatly alarmed, because Gibeon was a significant city, like one of the royal cities, and it was greater than Ai, and all its men were mighty warriors.

## Joshua 10:3

So Adoni-Zedek, king of Jerusalem, sent word to Hoham, king of Hebron, Piram, king of Jarmuth, Japhia, king of Lachish, and Debir, king of Eglon, saying,

## Joshua 10:4

“Come up and help me attack Gibeon, for it has made peace with Joshua and the Israelites.”

## Joshua 10:5

Then the five kings of the Amorites—the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon—joined forces. They moved with all their armies and camped against Gibeon to fight it.

## Joshua 10:6

The men of Gibeon sent word to Joshua at the camp at Gilgal, saying, “Do not abandon your servants; come up to us quickly and save us, for all the kings of the Amorites from the hill country have gathered against us.”

## Joshua 10:7

So Joshua went up from Gilgal with all the people of war, including all the valiant warriors.

## Joshua 10:8

And the Lord said to Joshua, “Do not fear them, for I have given them into your hand; not one of them shall be able to stand before you.”

## Joshua 10:9

Joshua came upon them suddenly, having marched all night from Gilgal.

## Joshua 10:10

And the Lord threw them into confusion before Israel, and He struck them with a great defeat at Gibeon, pursued them along the road going up to Beth Horon, and struck them down as far as Azekah and Makkedah.

## Joshua 10:11

As they fled from Israel on the descent of Beth Horon, the Lord hurled large hailstones from heaven on them as far as Azekah, and more died from the hailstones than were killed by the sword of the Israelites.

## Joshua 10:12

Then Joshua spoke to the Lord on the day the Lord delivered the Amorites over to Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel,

> “Sun, stand still over Gibeon,
> and moon, over the Valley of Aijalon.”

## Joshua 10:13

So the sun stood still,

> and the moon stopped,
> until the nation avenged themselves on their enemies.
> Is it not written in the Book of Jashar?

> The sun stopped in the middle of the sky
> and delayed going down for about a whole day.

## Joshua 10:14

There was no day like that before or since, when the Lord listened to the voice of a man; for the Lord fought for Israel.

## Joshua 10:15

Joshua, along with all Israel, returned to the camp at Gilgal.

## Joshua 10:16

Now the five kings had fled and hidden themselves in the cave at Makkedah.

## Joshua 10:17

And it was reported to Joshua, “The five kings have been found hidden in the cave at Makkedah.”

## Joshua 10:18

Joshua instructed, “Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave, and post men by it to guard them.

## Joshua 10:19

But do not stay there; pursue your enemies and attack them from behind. Do not let them enter their cities, for the Lord your God has given them into your hand.”

## Joshua 10:20

When Joshua and the Israelites had finished striking them with a great defeat, until they were destroyed, and the survivors who escaped had entered fortified cities,

## Joshua 10:21

all the people returned safely to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah, and no one uttered a word against the Israelites.

## Joshua 10:22

Joshua commanded, “Open the mouth of the cave and bring those five kings out to me.”

## Joshua 10:23

So the five kings were brought out of the cave—the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon.

## Joshua 10:24

When they had brought these kings to Joshua, he called for all the men of Israel and said to the commanders of the army who had gone with him, “Come forward and put your feet on the necks of these kings.” So they came forward and put their feet on their necks.

## Joshua 10:25

Joshua said to them, “Do not be afraid or dismayed; be strong and courageous, for the Lord will do this to all the enemies you fight.”

## Joshua 10:26

Then Joshua struck them and put them to death, and he hung them on five trees, and they were left hanging on the trees until evening.

## Joshua 10:27

At sunset, Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees and threw them into the cave where they had hidden, and placed large stones over the mouth of the cave, which remain to this day.

## Joshua 10:28

That day Joshua captured Makkedah and struck it and its king with the sword. He utterly destroyed everyone in it, leaving no survivors, and he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.

## Joshua 10:29

Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Makkedah to Libnah and fought against it.

## Joshua 10:30

The Lord also gave that city and its king into Israel’s hand. Joshua struck it with the sword, leaving no survivors, and he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.

## Joshua 10:31

Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Libnah to Lachish, took up positions against it, and attacked it.

## Joshua 10:32

The Lord handed Lachish over to Israel, and Joshua captured it on the second day. He struck it with the sword, just as he had done to Libnah.

## Joshua 10:33

Meanwhile, Horam, king of Gezer, came up to help Lachish, but Joshua defeated him and his army, leaving no survivors.

## Joshua 10:34

Then Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Lachish to Eglon, took up positions against it, and attacked it.

## Joshua 10:35

They captured it that same day and struck it with the sword, utterly destroying everyone in it, just as they had done to Lachish.

## Joshua 10:36

Afterward, Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron and attacked it.

## Joshua 10:37

They captured it and struck it with the sword, along with its king, its villages, and everyone in it. He left no survivors, just as they had done to Eglon.

## Joshua 10:38

Then Joshua and all Israel with him turned to Debir and attacked it.

## Joshua 10:39

They captured it, its king, and its villages, and struck them with the sword. He utterly destroyed everyone in it, leaving no survivors, just as he had done to Hebron and Libnah.

## Joshua 10:40

So Joshua conquered the whole region, including the hill country, the Negev, the western foothills, and the mountain slopes, along with all their kings. He left no survivors, utterly destroying all who breathed, as the Lord, the God of Israel, had commanded.

## Joshua 10:41

Joshua subdued the area from Kadesh Barnea to Gaza and from the whole region of Goshen to Gibeon.

## Joshua 10:42

All these kings and their lands Joshua captured in one campaign, because the Lord, the God of Israel, fought for Israel.

## Joshua 10:43

Afterwards, Joshua, along with all Israel, returned to the camp at Gilgal.
