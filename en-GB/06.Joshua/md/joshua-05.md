# Joshua Chapter 5

## Joshua 5:1
When all the kings of the Amorites west of the Jordan and all the kings of the Canaanites by the sea heard how the Lord had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the Israelites until they had crossed over, their hearts melted in fear, and they lost all spirit to face the Israelites.

## Joshua 5:2
At that time, the Lord instructed Joshua, “Prepare flint knives and perform the circumcision on the Israelites once more.”

## Joshua 5:3
So Joshua prepared flint knives and carried out the circumcision of the Israelites at Gibeath Haaraloth.

## Joshua 5:4
This is why Joshua circumcised them: all the males, the men of war who came out of Egypt, died in the wilderness on the journey after leaving Egypt.

## Joshua 5:5
All the people who came out had been circumcised, but those born in the wilderness on the way from Egypt had not been circumcised.

## Joshua 5:6
The Israelites wandered in the wilderness for forty years until all the men of war who had come out of Egypt perished because they did not obey the Lord. The Lord had sworn that they would not see the land He had promised their ancestors, a land flowing with milk and honey.

## Joshua 5:7
So He raised up their sons in their place, and these were the ones Joshua circumcised, as they were uncircumcised, having not been circumcised on the journey.

## Joshua 5:8
After the whole nation had been circumcised, they stayed in the camp until they were healed.

## Joshua 5:9
Then the Lord said to Joshua, “Today I have rolled away the disgrace of Egypt from you.” Therefore, the place has been called Gilgal to this day.

## Joshua 5:10
While camped at Gilgal on the plains of Jericho, the Israelites observed the Passover on the evening of the fourteenth day of the month.

## Joshua 5:11
The day after the Passover, on that very day, they ate some of the produce of the land: unleavened bread and roasted grain.

## Joshua 5:12
The manna ceased the day after they ate the produce of the land; there was no longer any manna for the Israelites, and that year they ate the yield of the land of Canaan.

## Joshua 5:13
When Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with a drawn sword in his hand. Joshua approached him and asked, “Are you for us or for our adversaries?”

## Joshua 5:14
He replied, “Neither, but as commander of the Lord’s army I have now come.” Then Joshua fell face down to the ground in reverence, and asked, “What message does my lord have for his servant?”

## Joshua 5:15
The commander of the Lord’s army said to Joshua, “Remove your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy.” And Joshua did so.
