# Joshua Chapter 15

## Joshua 15:1

The lot for the tribe of the descendants of Judah, according to their families, reached down to the border of Edom, extending to the wilderness of Zin in the far south.

## Joshua 15:2

Their southern boundary began at the bay at the southern end of the Salt Sea,

## Joshua 15:3

proceeded south of the ascent of Akrabbim, continued to Zin, and went up south of Kadesh-barnea. It then passed Hezron, went up to Addar, and turned toward Karka.

## Joshua 15:4

It continued to Azmon and joined the brook of Egypt, ending at the sea. This was their southern boundary.

## Joshua 15:5

The eastern boundary was the Salt Sea, up to the mouth of the Jordan. The northern boundary started from the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan,

## Joshua 15:6

went up to Beth-hoglah and continued north of Beth-arabah to the stone of Bohan, son of Reuben.

## Joshua 15:7

The boundary then ascended to Debir from the Valley of Achor and turned northward to Gilgal, opposite the ascent of Adummim, south of the valley. It continued to the waters of En-shemesh and ended at En-rogel.

## Joshua 15:8

Then it went up the Valley of Ben-hinnom along the southern slope of the Jebusite city (that is, Jerusalem). From there it ascended to the top of the hill west of the Hinnom Valley at the northern end of the Valley of Rephaim.

## Joshua 15:9

From the hilltop, the boundary turned toward the spring of the waters of Nephtoah, went out to the cities of Mount Ephron, and turned toward Baalah (that is, Kiriath-jearim).

## Joshua 15:10

Then it curved westward from Baalah to Mount Seir, ran along the northern slope of Mount Jearim (that is, Chesalon), descended to Beth-shemesh, and crossed to Timnah.

## Joshua 15:11

It went to the northern slope of Ekron, turned toward Shikkeron, passed along to Mount Baalah, and reached Jabneel, where the boundary ended at the sea.

## Joshua 15:12

The western boundary was the coastline of the Great Sea. These were the boundaries around the descendants of Judah according to their families.

## Joshua 15:13

In accordance with the Lord’s command to Joshua, he gave to Caleb son of Jephunneh a portion among the descendants of Judah, namely Kiriath-arba (Arba was the father of Anak), that is, Hebron.

## Joshua 15:14

Caleb drove out from there the three sons of Anak: Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak.

## Joshua 15:15

From there he went up against the inhabitants of Debir (formerly known as Kiriath-sepher).

## Joshua 15:16

Caleb said, “To the man who attacks and captures Kiriath-sepher, I will give my daughter Achsah in marriage.”

## Joshua 15:17

Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s brother, captured it; so Caleb gave him his daughter Achsah in marriage.

## Joshua 15:18

When she came to Othniel, she urged him to ask her father for a field. She dismounted from her donkey, and Caleb asked her, “What do you want?”

## Joshua 15:19

She replied, “Grant me a blessing. Since you have given me land in the Negev, give me also springs of water.” So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs.
