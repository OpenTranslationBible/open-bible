# Joshua Chapter 6

## Joshua 6:1
Now Jericho was securely shut up because of the Israelites; no one went out and no one came in.

## Joshua 6:2
And the Lord said to Joshua, “See, I have given Jericho into your hand, along with its king and its mighty men of valour.

## Joshua 6:3
You shall march around the city, all the men of war circling the city once. You shall do this for six days.

## Joshua 6:4
And seven priests shall carry seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark; on the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets.

## Joshua 6:5
When they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city will fall down flat, and the people shall go up, every man straight ahead.”

## Joshua 6:6
So Joshua son of Nun called the priests and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests carry seven trumpets of rams’ horns in front of the ark of the Lord.”

## Joshua 6:7
And he said to the people, “Proceed and march around the city, and let the armed men go ahead of the ark of the Lord.”

## Joshua 6:8
And it was so, that when Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of rams’ horns before the Lord went forward, blowing the trumpets, and the ark of the covenant of the Lord followed them.

## Joshua 6:9
The armed guard went ahead of the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard followed the ark, while the trumpets kept sounding.

## Joshua 6:10
But Joshua had commanded the people, saying, “You shall not shout or let your voice be heard, nor shall any word come out of your mouth, until the day I tell you to shout. Then you shall shout!”

## Joshua 6:11
So he had the ark of the Lord carried around the city, circling it once. Then they returned to the camp and spent the night there.

## Joshua 6:12
Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the Lord.

## Joshua 6:13
The seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of rams’ horns went on continually before the ark of the Lord, blowing the trumpets, and the armed men went ahead of them, and the rear guard followed the ark of the Lord, while the trumpets kept sounding.

## Joshua 6:14
On the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp. They did this for six days.

## Joshua 6:15
On the seventh day, they rose early at dawn and marched around the city in the same manner seven times; only on that day did they march around the city seven times.

## Joshua 6:16
At the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, “Shout! For the Lord has given you the city.

## Joshua 6:17
The city and all that is in it shall be devoted to the Lord; only Rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in her house shall be spared, because she hid the messengers we sent.

## Joshua 6:18
But keep yourselves from the things devoted to destruction, so that you do not covet them and take any of the devoted things, and make the camp of Israel liable to destruction and bring disaster upon it.

## Joshua 6:19
All the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron are sacred to the Lord; they shall go into the treasury of the Lord.”

## Joshua 6:20
So the people shouted, and the priests blew the trumpets; and when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, they shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so the people went up into the city, every man straight ahead, and they took the city.

## Joshua 6:21
They utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, sheep, and donkey, with the edge of the sword.

## Joshua 6:22
Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, “Go into the prostitute’s house and bring out the woman and all she has, in accordance with your oath to her.”

## Joshua 6:23
So the young men who had done the spying went in and brought out Rahab, her father, her mother, her brothers, and all she had; they also brought out all her relatives and placed them outside the camp of Israel.

## Joshua 6:24
Then they burned the city with fire and everything in it. Only the silver and gold, and the articles of bronze and iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the Lord.

## Joshua 6:25
But Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute, with her family and all who belonged to her, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua had sent to spy out Jericho; and she has lived among the Israelites to this day.

## Joshua 6:26
At that time Joshua pronounced this solemn oath: “Cursed before the Lord is the one who undertakes to rebuild this city, Jericho: at the cost of his firstborn he will lay its foundations; at the cost of his youngest he will set up its gates.”

## Joshua 6:27
So the Lord was with Joshua, and his fame spread throughout all the land.
