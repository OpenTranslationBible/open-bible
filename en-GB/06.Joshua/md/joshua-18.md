# Joshua Chapter 18

## Joshua 18:1

The entire assembly of the Israelites gathered at Shiloh and set up the tent of meeting there; the land was subdued before them.

## Joshua 18:2

However, there remained seven tribes among the Israelites who had not yet received their inheritance.

## Joshua 18:3

Joshua addressed the Israelites, saying, “How long will you delay before taking possession of the land that the Lord, the God of your forefathers, has given you?

## Joshua 18:4

Select three men from each tribe. I will send them out to survey the land and write a description of it, according to their inheritance, and then they shall return to me.

## Joshua 18:5

You shall divide the land into seven portions. Judah shall remain in its territory in the south, and the tribes of Joseph shall remain in their territory in the north.

## Joshua 18:6

Once you have written the descriptions of the seven divisions of the land, bring them to me here, and I will cast lots for you in the presence of the Lord our God.

## Joshua 18:7

The Levites, however, do not receive a portion among you, for the priestly service of the Lord is their inheritance. Gad, Reuben, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have already received their inheritance on the east side of the Jordan, which Moses, the servant of the Lord, assigned to them.”

## Joshua 18:8

As the men set out to map the land, Joshua instructed them, “Go and survey the land, write a description of it, and return to me. I will then cast lots for you here at Shiloh in the presence of the Lord.”

## Joshua 18:9

The men went and traversed the land, recording its description by towns in seven divisions, and returned to Joshua at the camp at Shiloh.

## Joshua 18:10

Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh in the presence of the Lord, and there he apportioned the land to the Israelites according to their tribal divisions.

## Joshua 18:11

The first lot fell to the tribe of Benjamin according to its clans; their allotted territory lay between the tribes of Judah and Joseph.

## Joshua 18:12

On the north side, their boundary began at the Jordan, ascended the northern slope of Jericho, and extended westward into the hill country, ending at the wilderness of Beth Aven.

## Joshua 18:13

From there, it crossed southward to the slope of Luz (that is, Bethel) and descended to Ataroth Addar, on the hill south of Lower Beth Horon.

## Joshua 18:14

From the hill facing Beth Horon southward, the boundary turned south along the western side, ending at Kiriath Baal (that is, Kiriath Jearim), a town of the people of Judah. This was the western side.

## Joshua 18:15

The southern side began at the edge of Kiriath Jearim, and the boundary extended to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah.

## Joshua 18:16

The boundary descended to the foot of the hill facing the Valley of Ben Hinnom, north of the Valley of Rephaim, and continued down the Hinnom Valley along the southern slope of the Jebusite city, and then to En Rogel.

## Joshua 18:17

It then turned northward, proceeded to En Shemesh, continued to Geliloth, opposite the ascent of Adummim, and descended to the Stone of Bohan son of Reuben.

## Joshua 18:18

It continued to the northern slope of Beth Arabah and descended into the Arabah.

## Joshua 18:19

The boundary then went to the northern slope of Beth Hoglah and ended at the northern bay of the Salt Sea, at the mouth of the Jordan in the south. This was the southern boundary.

## Joshua 18:20

The Jordan formed the boundary on the eastern side. These were the boundaries that defined the inheritance of the clans of Benjamin on all sides.
