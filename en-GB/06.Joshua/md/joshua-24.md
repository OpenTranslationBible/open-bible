# Joshua Chapter 24

## Joshua 24:1

Then Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel at Shechem. He summoned the elders, leaders, judges, and officials of Israel, and they presented themselves before God.

## Joshua 24:2

Joshua said to all the people, “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says:  
‘Long ago your ancestors, including Terah the father of Abraham and Nahor, lived beyond the Euphrates River and worshipped other gods.

## Joshua 24:3

But I took your father Abraham from the land beyond the Euphrates and led him throughout Canaan and gave him many descendants. I gave him Isaac,

## Joshua 24:4

and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. I assigned the hill country of Seir to Esau, but Jacob and his children went down to Egypt.

---

## Joshua 24:5

Then I sent Moses and Aaron, and I afflicted Egypt by what I did there, and afterward I brought you out.

## Joshua 24:6

When I brought your ancestors out of Egypt, you came to the sea, and the Egyptians pursued them with chariots and horsemen as far as the Red Sea.

## Joshua 24:7

But they cried out to the Lord, and He put darkness between you and the Egyptians; He brought the sea over them and covered them. You saw with your own eyes what I did to the Egyptians. Then you lived in the wilderness for a long time.

---

## Joshua 24:8

I brought you to the land of the Amorites who lived east of the Jordan. They fought against you, but I gave them into your hands. You took possession of their land when I destroyed them before you.

## Joshua 24:9

Then Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, prepared to fight against Israel. He summoned Balaam son of Beor to curse you,

## Joshua 24:10

but I would not listen to Balaam. So he blessed you again and again, and I delivered you out of his hand.

---

## Joshua 24:11

Then you crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho. The people of Jericho fought against you, as did the Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hittites, Girgashites, Hivites, and Jebusites, but I gave them into your hands.

## Joshua 24:12

I sent the hornet ahead of you, which drove them out before you—also the two Amorite kings. You did not do it with your own sword and bow.

## Joshua 24:13

So I gave you a land you did not toil for, and cities you did not build—and you live in them and eat from vineyards and olive groves you did not plant.’

---

## Joshua 24:14

“Now, therefore, fear the Lord and serve Him with all faithfulness. Throw away the gods your ancestors worshipped beyond the Euphrates and in Egypt, and serve the Lord.

## Joshua 24:15

But if serving the Lord seems undesirable to you, then choose for yourselves today whom you will serve—whether the gods your ancestors served beyond the Euphrates, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living.  
But as for me and my household, we will serve the Lord.”

---

## Joshua 24:16

Then the people answered, “Far be it from us to forsake the Lord to serve other gods!

## Joshua 24:17

It was the Lord our God Himself who brought us and our parents up out of Egypt, from that land of slavery, and performed those great signs before our eyes. He protected us on our entire journey and among all the nations through which we travelled.

## Joshua 24:18

And the Lord drove out before us all the nations, including the Amorites, who lived in the land. We too will serve the Lord, because He is our God.”

---

## Joshua 24:19

Joshua said to the people, “You are not able to serve the Lord. He is a holy God; He is a jealous God. He will not forgive your rebellion and your sins.

## Joshua 24:20

If you forsake the Lord and serve foreign gods, He will turn and bring disaster on you and make an end of you, after He has been good to you.”

---

## Joshua 24:21

But the people said to Joshua, “No! We will serve the Lord.”

## Joshua 24:22

Then Joshua said, “You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen to serve the Lord.”  
“Yes, we are witnesses,” they replied.

## Joshua 24:23

“Now then,” said Joshua, “throw away the foreign gods that are among you and yield your hearts to the Lord, the God of Israel.”

## Joshua 24:24

And the people said to Joshua, “We will serve the Lord our God and obey Him.”

---

## Joshua 24:25

On that day Joshua made a covenant for the people, and there at Shechem he reaffirmed for them decrees and laws.

## Joshua 24:26

And Joshua recorded these things in the Book of the Law of God. Then he took a large stone and set it up there under the oak near the holy place of the Lord.

## Joshua 24:27

“See!” he said to all the people. “This stone will be a witness against us. It has heard all the words the Lord has spoken to us. It will be a witness against you if you are untrue to your God.”

---

## Joshua 24:28

Then Joshua dismissed the people, each to their own inheritance.

---

## Joshua 24:29

After these things, Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died at the age of a hundred and ten.

## Joshua 24:30

And they buried him in the land of his inheritance, at Timnath Serah in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.

---

## Joshua 24:31

Israel served the Lord throughout the lifetime of Joshua and of the elders who outlived him and had experienced everything the Lord had done for Israel.

---

## Joshua 24:32

Joseph’s bones, which the Israelites had brought up from Egypt, were buried at Shechem in the plot of land that Jacob bought for a hundred pieces of silver from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem. This became the inheritance of Joseph’s descendants.

---

## Joshua 24:33

And Eleazar son of Aaron died and was buried at Gibeah, which had been given to his son Phinehas in the hill country of Ephraim.
