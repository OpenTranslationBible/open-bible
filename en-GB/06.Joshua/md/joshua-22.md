# Joshua Chapter 22

## Joshua 22:1

Then Joshua called together the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh,

## Joshua 22:2

and spoke to them, “You have kept all that Moses, the servant of the Lord, commanded you, and have listened to my voice in all that I instructed you.

## Joshua 22:3

For a long time now, you have not abandoned your brothers, but have fulfilled the duty commanded by the Lord your God.

## Joshua 22:4

Now that the Lord your God has given rest to your brothers, as He promised, return to your tents in the land that Moses, the servant of the Lord, gave you beyond the Jordan.

## Joshua 22:5

Be very careful to observe the commandment and the law that Moses, the servant of the Lord, gave you: to love the Lord your God, to walk in all His ways, to keep His commandments, to hold fast to Him, and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul.”

## Joshua 22:6

So Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they returned to their tents.

## Joshua 22:7

To the half-tribe of Manasseh, Moses had given land in Bashan, but to the other half, Joshua gave land among their brothers on the west side of the Jordan. When Joshua sent them away to their tents, he blessed them,

## Joshua 22:8

saying, “Return to your tents with great wealth, with numerous livestock, silver, gold, bronze, iron, and a large quantity of clothing. Share the spoils of your enemies with your brothers.”

## Joshua 22:9

Thus, the sons of Reuben, the sons of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned home, leaving the Israelites at Shiloh in Canaan, to go to the land of Gilead, their own land, which they had acquired in accordance with the command of the Lord through Moses.

## Joshua 22:10

When they reached the region of the Jordan in the land of Canaan, the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh built an imposing altar there by the Jordan.

## Joshua 22:11

And the Israelites heard a report: “Behold, the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar on the border of Canaan, at the region of the Jordan, on the Israelite side.”

## Joshua 22:12

When the Israelites heard of this, the whole assembly gathered at Shiloh to go to war against them.

## Joshua 22:13

So the Israelites sent Phinehas, son of Eleazar, the priest, to the land of Gilead—to the Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.

## Joshua 22:14

Along with him, they sent ten leaders, one from each of the tribes of Israel, each the head of a family division among the Israelite clans.

## Joshua 22:15

When they arrived in Gilead, they spoke to the Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, saying,

## Joshua 22:16

“This is what the whole assembly of the Lord says: ‘What is this act of unfaithfulness you have committed against the God of Israel by turning away from the Lord and building yourselves an altar, in rebellion against Him?

## Joshua 22:17

Was not the sin of Peor enough for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves to this day, despite a plague on the assembly of the Lord?

## Joshua 22:18

And now you are turning away from the Lord. If you rebel against the Lord today, tomorrow He will be angry with the whole community of Israel.

## Joshua 22:19

If the land of your possession is defiled, cross over into the land of the Lord’s possession, where the Lord’s tabernacle stands, and share the land with us. But do not rebel against the Lord or against us by building an altar for yourselves other than the altar of the Lord our God.

## Joshua 22:20

Did not Achan, son of Zerah, act unfaithfully regarding the devoted things, and wrath fell upon the whole community of Israel? He was not the only one who perished for his sin.’”

---

## Joshua 22:21

Then the Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh replied to the heads of the clans of Israel:

## Joshua 22:22

“The Mighty One, God, the Lord! He knows, and let Israel know. If this has been in rebellion or disobedience to the Lord, do not spare us this day.

## Joshua 22:23

If we have built our own altar to turn away from the Lord, or to offer burnt offerings, grain offerings, or sacrifices of peace offerings on it, may the Lord Himself call us to account.

## Joshua 22:24

No! We did it out of concern that in the future your descendants might say to ours, ‘What have you to do with the Lord, the God of Israel?

## Joshua 22:25

For the Lord has made the Jordan a boundary between us and you, you Reubenites and Gadites; you have no share in the Lord.’ So your descendants might cause ours to stop fearing the Lord.

## Joshua 22:26

That is why we said, ‘Let us prepare and build an altar—but not for burnt offerings or sacrifices.

## Joshua 22:27

Instead, it is to be a witness between us and you and the generations that follow, that we will worship the Lord at His sanctuary with our burnt offerings, sacrifices, and fellowship offerings. Then in the future, your descendants will not be able to say to ours, ‘You have no share in the Lord.’

## Joshua 22:28

And we said, ‘If they ever say this to us or to our descendants, we will answer: Look at the replica of the Lord’s altar, which our ancestors built, not for burnt offerings or sacrifices, but as a witness between us and you.’

## Joshua 22:29

Far be it from us to rebel against the Lord and turn away from Him today by building an altar for burnt offerings, grain offerings, or sacrifices, other than the altar of the Lord our God that stands before His tabernacle.”

## Joshua 22:30

When Phinehas the priest and the leaders of the community—the heads of the clans of the Israelites—heard what the Reubenites, Gadites, and Manasseh had to say, they were pleased.

## Joshua 22:31

And Phinehas, son of Eleazar, the priest, said to the Reubenites, Gadites, and Manasseh, “Today we know that the Lord is with us, because you have not been unfaithful to the Lord in this matter. Now you have saved the Israelites from the Lord’s hand.”

---

## Joshua 22:32

Then Phinehas, son of Eleazar, the priest, and the leaders returned to Canaan from their meeting with the Reubenites and Gadites in Gilead and reported back to the Israelites.

## Joshua 22:33

The Israelites were pleased to hear the report and praised God. They spoke no more of going to war against them to devastate the land where the Reubenites and the Gadites lived.

## Joshua 22:34

And the Reubenites and the Gadites named the altar Witness; “For,” they said, “it is a witness between us that the Lord is God.”
