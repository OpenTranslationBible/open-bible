# Joshua Chapter 8

## Joshua 8:1

Then the Lord spoke to Joshua, saying, “Do not fear or be discouraged. Take all the warriors with you, and go up to Ai. See, I have delivered into your hands the king of Ai, his people, his city, and his land.

## Joshua 8:2

You shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king, but you may take its spoils and livestock for yourselves. Set an ambush behind the city.”

---

## Joshua 8:3

So Joshua rose with all the people of war to go up to Ai. He selected thirty thousand valiant warriors and sent them out by night

## Joshua 8:4

with these instructions: “Behold, you shall ambush the city from behind. Do not go far from it, but all of you be on the alert.

## Joshua 8:5

I and all the people with me will approach the city, and when they come out to meet us as they did before, we will flee from them.

## Joshua 8:6

They will pursue us until we have drawn them away from the city, for they will say, ‘They are fleeing before us as they did previously.’ So we will flee before them.

## Joshua 8:7

Then you shall rise from the ambush and seize the city, for the Lord your God will deliver it into your hand.

## Joshua 8:8

When you have taken the city, set it on fire, in accordance with the word of the Lord. See, you have my command.”

## Joshua 8:9

Joshua sent them away, and they went to the place of ambush and lay in wait between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai; but Joshua spent that night with the people.

## Joshua 8:10

Joshua rose early in the morning and mustered the people, and he and the elders of Israel went up before the people to Ai.

## Joshua 8:11

All the people of war with him went up and approached the city, and they camped on the north side of Ai, with a valley between them and the city.

## Joshua 8:12

He took about five thousand men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.

## Joshua 8:13

So the people took their positions, with the main camp to the north of the city and the ambush to the west of it. Joshua spent that night in the valley.

## Joshua 8:14

When the king of Ai saw this, he and all his men of the city hurried out early to meet Israel in battle at the appointed place before the desert plain, but he did not know there was an ambush against him behind the city.

## Joshua 8:15

Joshua and all Israel pretended to be beaten before them and fled towards the wilderness.

## Joshua 8:16

All the men of Ai were summoned to pursue them, and they pursued Joshua and were drawn away from the city.

## Joshua 8:17

Not a man was left in Ai or Bethel who did not go after Israel, leaving the city open as they pursued Israel.

## Joshua 8:18

Then the Lord said to Joshua, “Stretch out the javelin that is in your hand toward Ai, for I will deliver the city into your hand.” So Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city.

## Joshua 8:19

As soon as he did this, the men in ambush rose quickly from their place and ran to enter the city, capturing it and setting it on fire swiftly.

## Joshua 8:20

The men of Ai turned and saw the smoke of the city rising to the sky, and they had no opportunity to flee in any direction; the Israelites who had been fleeing to the wilderness turned back against their pursuers.

## Joshua 8:21

When Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had captured the city and that smoke was rising from it, they turned back and attacked the men of Ai.

## Joshua 8:22

The others came out of the city against them, so they were caught in the middle, with Israelites on both sides. Israel struck them down, leaving neither survivors nor fugitives.

## Joshua 8:23

But they captured the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua.

## Joshua 8:24

When Israel had finished killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the fields and in the wilderness where they had pursued them, and all had fallen by the sword, all Israel returned to Ai and struck it with the edge of the sword.

## Joshua 8:25

Twelve thousand men and women fell that day—all the people of Ai.

## Joshua 8:26

For Joshua did not withdraw the hand with which he stretched out the javelin until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.

## Joshua 8:27

The Israelites took only the cattle and the spoils of the city as plunder for themselves, as the Lord had commanded Joshua.

## Joshua 8:28

So Joshua burned Ai and made it a heap of ruins, a desolate place to this day.

## Joshua 8:29

He hanged the king of Ai on a tree until evening, and at sunset Joshua commanded that they take his body down from the tree, throw it at the entrance of the city gate, and raise a large heap of stones over it, which remains to this day.

## Joshua 8:30

Then Joshua built an altar to the Lord, the God of Israel, on Mount Ebal,

## Joshua 8:31

as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded the Israelites, as it is written in the Book of the Law of Moses—an altar of uncut stones, on which no iron tool had been used. They offered burnt offerings on it to the Lord, and sacrificed fellowship offerings.

## Joshua 8:32

There, in the presence of the Israelites, Joshua wrote on stones a copy of the Law of Moses.

## Joshua 8:33

All Israel, with their elders, officials, and judges, stood on both sides of the ark of the covenant of the Lord, facing the Levitical priests who carried it. Both the foreigners living among them and the native-born were present. Half of the people stood in front of Mount Gerizim and half in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded when he blessed the people of Israel.

## Joshua 8:34

Afterward, Joshua read all the words of the law—the blessings and the curses—just as it is written in the Book of the Law.

## Joshua 8:35

There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded that Joshua did not read to the whole assembly of Israel, including the women, children, and the foreigners living among them.
