The allotment for the descendants of Joseph went from the Jordan at Jericho to the waters of Jericho on the east, through the wilderness going up from Jericho into the hill country of Bethel.

It went on from Bethel (that is, Luz), crossed over to Ataroth in the territory of the Arkites,

descended westward to the territory of the Japhletites as far as the border of Lower Beth Horon and Gezer, and ended at the Mediterranean Sea.

## Joshua 16:4

So the descendants of Joseph—Manasseh and Ephraim—received their inheritance.

## Joshua 16:5

This was the territory of Ephraim, according to its clans:  
The boundary of their inheritance went from Ataroth Addar in the east to Upper Beth Horon,

and continued to the sea. From Mikmethath on the north it turned eastward to Taanath Shiloh, passing by it on the east to Janoah.

Then it went down from Janoah to Ataroth and Naarah, touched Jericho, and came out at the Jordan.

## Joshua 16:8

From Tappuah the boundary went westward to the Kanah Ravine and ended at the sea.  
This was the inheritance of the tribe of Ephraim, according to its clans,

along with the towns set apart for the Ephraimites within the inheritance of the Manassites—all the towns and their villages.

## Joshua 16:10

But they did not drive out the Canaanites living in Gezer; so to this day the Canaanites live among the people of Ephraim but are forced into labour.
