# 2 John Chapter 1

## 2 John 1:1

The elder,  
To the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not only I, but also all who know the truth,

## 2 John 1:2

because of the truth that abides in us and will remain with us always:

## 2 John 1:3

Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.

## 2 John 1:4

I was delighted to discover that some of your children are living in truth, just as we have been commanded by the Father.

## 2 John 1:5

Now I ask you, lady, not as though I were writing a new commandment to you, but one which we have had from the beginning, that we love one another.

## 2 John 1:6

And this is love, that we live according to His commandments. This is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it.

## 2 John 1:7

For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not acknowledge Jesus Christ as having come in the flesh. Such a person is the deceiver and the antichrist.

## 2 John 1:8

Watch yourselves, so that you do not lose what we have accomplished, but that you may receive a full reward.

## 2 John 1:9

Anyone who goes beyond and does not remain in the teaching of Christ does not have God; the one who remains in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.

## 2 John 1:10

If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not welcome them into your house, and do not offer them a greeting;

## 2 John 1:11

for the one who offers them a greeting shares in their evil deeds.

## 2 John 1:12

Though I have many things to write to you, I prefer not to do so with paper and ink; but I hope to visit you and speak face to face, so that your joy may be complete.

## 2 John 1:13

The children of your chosen sister send their greetings.
