# 3 John Chapter 1

## 3 John 1:1

The elder,  
To the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth.

## 3 John 1:2

Beloved, I pray that in all respects you may prosper and be in good health, just as your soul prospers.

## 3 John 1:3

For I was overjoyed when brothers came and testified to your truth, that is, how you are walking in truth.

## 3 John 1:4

I have no greater joy than this, to hear of my children walking in the truth.

## 3 John 1:5

Beloved, you are acting faithfully in whatever you accomplish for the brothers and sisters, and especially when they are strangers;

## 3 John 1:6

and they have testified to your love before the church. You will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of God.

## 3 John 1:7

For they went out for the sake of the Name, accepting nothing from the Gentiles.

## 3 John 1:8

Therefore, we ought to support such people, so that we may prove to be fellow workers with the truth.

## 3 John 1:9

I wrote something to the church; but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, does not accept what we say.

## 3 John 1:10

For this reason, if I come, I will call attention to his deeds which he does, unjustly accusing us with wicked words; and not satisfied with this, he himself does not receive the brothers either, and he forbids those who want to do so and puts them out of the church.

## 3 John 1:11

Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. The one who does what is good is of God; the one who does what is evil has not seen God.

## 3 John 1:12

Demetrius has received a good testimony from everyone, and from the truth itself; and we add our testimony, and you know that our testimony is true.

## 3 John 1:13

I had many things to write to you, but I do not want to write to you with pen and ink;

## 3 John 1:14

but I hope to see you shortly, and we will speak face to face.

## 3 John 1:15

Peace be to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends by name.
