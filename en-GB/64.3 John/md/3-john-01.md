# 3 John Chapter 1

## 3 John 1:1

The elder,  
To the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth.

## 3 John 1:2

Dear friend, I pray that you may prosper in every way and enjoy good health, just as your soul is thriving.

## 3 John 1:3

For I was filled with joy when brothers came and testified about your truth, specifically how you are living in the truth.

## 3 John 1:4

There is no greater joy for me than to hear that my children are living in the truth.

## 3 John 1:5

Dear friend, you are faithful in what you do for the brothers and sisters, even though they are strangers to you;

## 3 John 1:6

and they have spoken of your love before the church. You will do well to send them on their way in a manner that honours God.

## 3 John 1:7

For they went out for the sake of the Name, accepting no assistance from the Gentiles.

## 3 John 1:8

Therefore, we ought to support such people, so that we may be fellow workers for the truth.

## 3 John 1:9

I wrote a letter to the church; but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, does not acknowledge our authority.

## 3 John 1:10

For this reason, if I come, I will bring up what he is doing, spreading malicious nonsense about us; and not content with that, he refuses to welcome the brothers, and he also stops those who want to do so and puts them out of the church.

## 3 John 1:11

Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. Whoever does good is from God; whoever does evil has not seen God.

## 3 John 1:12

Demetrius is well spoken of by everyone, and by the truth itself; we also speak well of him, and you know that our testimony is reliable.

## 3 John 1:13

I have many things to write to you, but I prefer not to do so with pen and ink;

## 3 John 1:14

I hope to visit you soon, and we will converse face to face.

## 3 John 1:15

Peace be with you. The friends here send their greetings. Greet the friends there by name.
