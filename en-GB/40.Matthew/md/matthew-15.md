# Matthew Chapter 15

## Matthew 15:1

Then some Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked,

## Matthew 15:2

“Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? They do not wash their hands when they eat bread.”

## Matthew 15:3

Jesus replied, “And why do you break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?

## Matthew 15:4

For God said, ‘Honour your father and mother,’ and, ‘Anyone who speaks evil of their father or mother must be put to death.’

## Matthew 15:5

But you say that if anyone declares to their father or mother, ‘Whatever help you might have received from me is a gift to God,’

## Matthew 15:6

they are not to honour their father or mother with it. Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition.

## Matthew 15:7

You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you:

## Matthew 15:8

> ‘These people honour me with their lips,
> but their hearts are far from me.

## Matthew 15:9

> They worship me in vain;
> their teachings are merely human rules.’

## Matthew 15:10

Jesus called the crowd to him and said, “Listen and understand.

## Matthew 15:11

It is not what enters the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles them.”

---

## Matthew 15:12

Then the disciples came to him and said, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?”

## Matthew 15:13

He replied, “Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted.

## Matthew 15:14

Leave them; they are blind guides. If the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit.”

---

## Matthew 15:15

Peter said, “Explain the parable to us.”

## Matthew 15:16

“Are you still so dull?” Jesus asked them.

## Matthew 15:17

“Do you not see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then is eliminated?

## Matthew 15:18

But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and these defile a person.

## Matthew 15:19

For out of the heart come evil thoughts—murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander.

## Matthew 15:20

These are what defile a person; but eating with unwashed hands does not defile them.”

## Matthew 15:21

Jesus left that place and withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon.

## Matthew 15:22

A Canaanite woman from that region came to him, crying out, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is severely demon-possessed.”

## Matthew 15:23

But Jesus did not answer her a word. So his disciples came to him and urged him, “Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us.”

## Matthew 15:24

He answered, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”

## Matthew 15:25

The woman came and knelt before him. “Lord, help me!” she said.

## Matthew 15:26

He replied, “It is not right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”

## Matthew 15:27

“Yes, Lord,” she said, “but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters’ table.”

## Matthew 15:28

Then Jesus said to her, “Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted.” And her daughter was healed at that moment.

## Matthew 15:29

Jesus left there and went along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a mountainside and sat down.

## Matthew 15:30

Great crowds came to him, bringing the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute and many others, and laid them at his feet; and he healed them.

## Matthew 15:31

The people were amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled made well, the lame walking and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel.

## Matthew 15:32

Jesus called his disciples to him and said, “I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may faint on the way.”

## Matthew 15:33

His disciples answered, “Where could we get enough bread in this desolate place to feed such a crowd?”

## Matthew 15:34

“How many loaves do you have?” Jesus asked. “Seven,” they replied, “and a few small fish.”

## Matthew 15:35

He directed the crowd to sit down on the ground.

## Matthew 15:36

Then he took the seven loaves and the fish, and when he had given thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and they in turn to the people.

## Matthew 15:37

They all ate and were satisfied. Afterward the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.

## Matthew 15:38

The number of those who ate was four thousand men, besides women and children.

## Matthew 15:39

After sending the crowds away, Jesus got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
