# Matthew Chapter 15

## Matthew 15:1

Then some Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and said,

## Matthew 15:2

“Why do Your disciples break the tradition of the elders?  
For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.”

## Matthew 15:3

And He answered and said to them,  
“Why do you yourselves also break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?

## Matthew 15:4

For God said, ‘Honour your father and mother,’ and,  
‘The one who speaks evil of father or mother is to be put to death.’

## Matthew 15:5

But you say, ‘Whoever says to his father or mother,  
“Whatever I have that would help you has been given to God,”

## Matthew 15:6

he is not to honour his father or mother.’  
And by this you have invalidated the word of God for the sake of your tradition.

## Matthew 15:7

You hypocrites, rightly did Isaiah prophesy about you, by saying:

## Matthew 15:8

> ‘This people honours Me with their lips,  
> But their heart is far away from Me.

## Matthew 15:9

> And in vain do they worship Me,  
> Teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’”

## Matthew 15:10

After Jesus called the crowd to Him, He said to them,  
“Hear and understand:

## Matthew 15:11

It is not what enters the mouth that defiles the person,  
but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles the person.”

---

## Matthew 15:12

Then the disciples came and said to Him,  
“Do You know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this statement?”

## Matthew 15:13

But He answered and said,  
“Every plant which My heavenly Father did not plant will be uprooted.

## Matthew 15:14

Leave them alone; they are blind guides of blind people.  
And if a person who is blind guides another who is blind, both will fall into a pit.”

## Matthew 15:15

Peter said to Him, “Explain the parable to us.”

## Matthew 15:16

Jesus said, “Are you also still lacking in understanding?

## Matthew 15:17

Do you not understand that everything that goes into the mouth passes into the stomach, and is eliminated?

## Matthew 15:18

But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and those things defile the person.

## Matthew 15:19

For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual immoralities, thefts, false testimonies, slanderous statements.

## Matthew 15:20

These are the things that defile the person;  
but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile the person.”

## Matthew 15:21

Jesus went away from there, and withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon.

## Matthew 15:22

And behold, a Canaanite woman from that region came out and began to cry out, saying,  
“Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David; my daughter is severely demon-possessed.”

## Matthew 15:23

But He did not answer her with even a word.  
And His disciples came up and urged Him, saying, “Send her away, because she keeps shouting at us!”

## Matthew 15:24

But He answered and said,  
“I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”

## Matthew 15:25

But she came and began to bow down before Him, saying, “Lord, help me!”

## Matthew 15:26

Yet He answered and said,  
“It is not good to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”

## Matthew 15:27

And she said,  
“Yes, Lord; but please help, for even the dogs feed on the crumbs that fall from their masters’ table.”

## Matthew 15:28

Then Jesus said to her,  
“O woman, your faith is great; it shall be done for you as you desire.”  
And her daughter was healed at once.

## Matthew 15:29

Departing from there, Jesus went along the Sea of Galilee,  
and after going up on the mountain, He was sitting there.

## Matthew 15:30

And large crowds came to Him, bringing with them those who were limping, had impaired limbs, were blind, unable to speak, and many others,  
and they laid them down at His feet; and He healed them.

## Matthew 15:31

So the crowd was astonished as they saw those who were unable to speak talking,  
those with impaired limbs restored, those who were limping walking around, and those who were blind seeing;  
and they glorified the God of Israel.

## Matthew 15:32

Now Jesus called His disciples to Him, and said,  
“I feel compassion for the people, because they have remained with Me now for three days and have nothing to eat;  
and I do not want to send them away hungry, since they might faint on the way.”

## Matthew 15:33

The disciples said to Him,  
“Where would we get so many loaves in this desolate place to satisfy such a large crowd?”

## Matthew 15:34

And Jesus said to them, “How many loaves do you have?”  
And they said, “Seven, and a few small fish.”

## Matthew 15:35

And He directed the people to sit down on the ground;

## Matthew 15:36

and He took the seven loaves and the fish;  
and after giving thanks, He broke them and gave them to the disciples,  
and the disciples gave them to the people.

## Matthew 15:37

And they all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up what was left over of the broken pieces: seven large baskets full.

## Matthew 15:38

And those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.

## Matthew 15:39

And after sending away the crowds, Jesus got into the boat and came to the region of Magadan.
