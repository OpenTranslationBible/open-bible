# Matthew Chapter 15

## Matthew 15:1

Then some Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and asked,

## Matthew 15:2

“Why do your disciples disregard the tradition of the elders? They do not wash their hands before they eat.”

## Matthew 15:3

Jesus replied, “And why do you break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?

## Matthew 15:4

For God said, ‘Honour your father and mother,’ and, ‘Anyone who speaks evil of their father or mother must be put to death.’

## Matthew 15:5

But you say that if anyone declares to their father or mother, ‘Whatever help you might have received from me is a gift to God,’

## Matthew 15:6

they are not to fulfill their duty to their father or mother with it. Thus you nullify the word of God for the sake of your tradition.

## Matthew 15:7

You pretenders! Isaiah was correct when he prophesied about you:

## Matthew 15:8

> ‘These people honour me with their lips,
> but their hearts are distant from me.

## Matthew 15:9

> Their worship is in vain;
> their teachings are nothing more than a man's instructions.’

## Matthew 15:10

Jesus gathered the crowd and said, “Listen and understand.

## Matthew 15:11

It is not what enters the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles them.”

---

## Matthew 15:12

Then the disciples came to him and said, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this?”

## Matthew 15:13

He replied, “Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted.

## Matthew 15:14

Let them be; they are blind guides. If the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit.”

---

## Matthew 15:15

Peter said, “Help us understand the parable.”

## Matthew 15:16

“Are you still lacking in understanding?” Jesus asked them.

## Matthew 15:17

“Do you not see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then is eliminated?

## Matthew 15:18

But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and these defile a person.

## Matthew 15:19

For out of the heart come evil thoughts—acts of murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander.

## Matthew 15:20

These are what truly defile a person; however, eating with unwashed hands does not make them unclean.”

## Matthew 15:21

Jesus left that place and withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon.

## Matthew 15:22

A Canaanite woman from that region came to him, crying out, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is severely demon-possessed.”

## Matthew 15:23

But Jesus did not answer her a word. So his disciples came to him and urged him, “Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us.”

## Matthew 15:24

He responded, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.”

## Matthew 15:25

The woman came and bowed before him. “Lord, help me!” she said.

## Matthew 15:26

He replied, “It is not right to take the children’s bread and give it to the dogs.”

## Matthew 15:27

“Yes, Lord,” she said, “but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters’ table.”

## Matthew 15:28

Then Jesus said to her, “Woman, your faith is great! Your request is granted.” And her daughter was healed at that moment.

## Matthew 15:29

Jesus departed from there and travelled along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a mountainside and sat down.

## Matthew 15:30

Large crowds came to him, bringing the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute, and many others, and laid them at his feet; and he healed them.

## Matthew 15:31

The people were amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled made well, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel.

## Matthew 15:32

Jesus called his disciples to him and said, “I have compassion for these people; they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry, or they may faint on the way.”

## Matthew 15:33

His disciples answered, “Where could we get enough bread in this desolate place to feed such a crowd?”

## Matthew 15:34

“What quantity of loaves do you have?” Jesus asked. “Seven,” they replied, “and a few small fish.”

## Matthew 15:35

He directed the crowd to be seated on the ground.

## Matthew 15:36

Then he took the seven loaves and the fish, and after giving thanks, he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and they in turn to the people.

## Matthew 15:37

Everyone ate and was satisfied. Afterward, the disciples collected seven basketfuls of leftover pieces.

## Matthew 15:38

Those who ate numbered four thousand men, along with women and children.

## Matthew 15:39

After sending the crowds away, Jesus got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
