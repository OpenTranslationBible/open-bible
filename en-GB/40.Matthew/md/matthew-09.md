# Matthew Chapter 9

## Matthew 9:1

Jesus entered a boat, crossed over the Sea of Galilee, and came to his own city.

## Matthew 9:2

Some men brought to him a paralysed man on a stretcher. Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralysed man, “Take heart, son; your sins are forgiven.”

## Matthew 9:3

At this, some of the scribes said to themselves, “This man is blaspheming!”

## Matthew 9:4

But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, “Why do you harbour evil thoughts in your hearts?

## Matthew 9:5

What is simpler: to declare, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, Get up and walk’?

## Matthew 9:6

But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—he then said to the paralysed man, “Get up, take your stretcher and go home.”

## Matthew 9:7

The man arose and returned to his house.

## Matthew 9:8

When the crowds saw this, they were filled with awe and glorified God, who had given such authority to men.

## Matthew 9:9

As Jesus moved on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector’s booth. He said to him, “Follow me,” and Matthew got up and followed him.

## Matthew 9:10

Later, as Jesus was reclining at the table in the house, many tax collectors and sinners came and dined with him and his disciples.

## Matthew 9:11

Observing this, the Pharisees questioned his disciples, “Why does your teacher share meals with tax collectors and sinners?”

## Matthew 9:12

Upon hearing this, Jesus remarked, “It is not those who are well who need a doctor, but those who are unwell.

## Matthew 9:13

Now go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice.’ For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”

## Matthew 9:14

Then John’s disciples came to him and asked, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?”

## Matthew 9:15

Jesus replied, “Can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while he is with them? The time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and then they will fast.

## Matthew 9:16

“No one patches an old garment with unshrunk cloth, for the patch will pull away from the garment, making the tear worse.

## Matthew 9:17

Nor do people pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst, the wine will spill, and the wineskins will be ruined. Instead, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.”

## Matthew 9:18

While he was speaking, a synagogue leader approached and knelt before him, saying, “My daughter has just died. But come and lay your hand on her, and she will live.”

## Matthew 9:19

Jesus got up and went with him, along with his disciples.

## Matthew 9:20

Just then, a woman who had suffered from bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak.

## Matthew 9:21

She thought to herself, “If I only touch his cloak, I will be healed.”

## Matthew 9:22

Turning and seeing her, Jesus said, “Take heart, daughter; your faith has healed you.” And the woman was healed at that moment.

## Matthew 9:23

When Jesus arrived at the synagogue leader’s house and saw the flute players and the noisy crowd,

## Matthew 9:24

he said, “Go away; the girl is not dead but asleep.” And they laughed at him.

## Matthew 9:25

Once the crowd had been sent outside, he went in, took the girl by the hand, and she arose.

## Matthew 9:26

News of this spread throughout that region.

## Matthew 9:27

As Jesus left that place, two blind men followed him, shouting, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!”

## Matthew 9:28

When he had gone indoors, the blind men came to him, and he asked them, “Do you believe that I am able to do this?” They replied, “Yes, Lord.”

## Matthew 9:29

So he touched their eyes and said, “Let it be done for you, in accordance with your faith”;

## Matthew 9:30

and their sight was restored. Jesus sternly warned them, “See that no one knows about this.”

## Matthew 9:31

However, they went out and spread the news about him throughout that region.

---

## Matthew 9:32

As they were leaving, a man who was demon-possessed and unable to speak was brought to Jesus.

## Matthew 9:33

When the demon was driven out, the mute man spoke. The crowds were amazed and said, “Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel.”

## Matthew 9:34

But the Pharisees remarked, “He drives out demons by the ruler of demons.”

---

## Matthew 9:35

Jesus travelled through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness.

## Matthew 9:36

When he saw the crowds, he was moved with compassion for them, because they were troubled and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.

## Matthew 9:37

Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is abundant, but the workers are few.

## Matthew 9:38

Therefore, ask the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest field.”
