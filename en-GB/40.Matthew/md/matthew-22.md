# Matthew Chapter 22

## Matthew 22:1

Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying,

## Matthew 22:2

“The kingdom of heaven is like a king who held a wedding feast for his son.

## Matthew 22:3

And he sent his slaves to call those who had been invited to the wedding feast,  
and they were unwilling to come.

## Matthew 22:4

Again he sent other slaves, saying,  
‘Tell those who have been invited, “Behold, I have prepared my dinner;  
my oxen and fattened cattle are slaughtered, and everything is ready;  
come to the wedding feast!”’

## Matthew 22:5

But they paid no attention and went their separate ways,  
one to his own farm, another to his business,

## Matthew 22:6

and the rest seized his slaves and treated them abusively, and then killed them.

## Matthew 22:7

Now the king was angry, and he sent his armies and destroyed those murderers and set their city on fire.

## Matthew 22:8

Then he said to his slaves,  
‘The wedding feast is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.

## Matthew 22:9

So go to the main roads, and invite whomever you find there to the wedding feast.’

## Matthew 22:10

Those slaves went out into the streets and gathered together all whom they found, both bad and good;  
and the wedding hall was filled with dinner guests.

---

## Matthew 22:11

But when the king came in to look over the dinner guests,  
he saw a man there who was not dressed in wedding clothes,

## Matthew 22:12

and he said to him,  
‘Friend, how did you get in here without wedding clothes?’  
And the man was speechless.

## Matthew 22:13

Then the king said to the servants,  
‘Tie his hands and feet, and throw him into the outer darkness;  
in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’

## Matthew 22:14

For many are called, but few are chosen.”

---

## Matthew 22:15

Then the Pharisees went and plotted together how they might trap Him in what He said.

## Matthew 22:16

And they sent their disciples to Him, along with the Herodians, saying,  
“Teacher, we know that You are truthful and teach the way of God in truth,  
and do not care what anyone thinks; for You are not partial to anyone.

## Matthew 22:17

Tell us then, what do You think? Is it permissible to pay a poll-tax to Caesar, or not?”

## Matthew 22:18

But Jesus perceived their malice, and said,  
“Why are you testing Me, you hypocrites?

## Matthew 22:19

Show Me the coin used for the poll-tax.”  
And they brought Him a denarius.

## Matthew 22:20

And He said to them,  
“Whose image and inscription is this?”

## Matthew 22:21

They said to Him, “Caesar’s.”  
Then He said to them,  
“Then pay to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s; and to God the things that are God’s.”

## Matthew 22:22

And hearing this, they were amazed; and they left Him and went away.

---

## Matthew 22:23

On that day some Sadducees (who say there is no resurrection) came to Him and questioned Him,

## Matthew 22:24

saying,  
“Teacher, Moses said, ‘If a man dies having no children, his brother shall marry his wife,  
and raise up offspring for his brother.’

## Matthew 22:25

Now there were seven brothers among us; and the first married and died, and having no offspring,  
left his wife to his brother.

## Matthew 22:26

It was the same also with the second and the third, down to the seventh.

## Matthew 22:27

Last of all, the woman also died.

## Matthew 22:28

In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife of the seven will she be?  
For they all had her in marriage.”

## Matthew 22:29

But Jesus answered and said to them,  
“You are mistaken, since you do not understand the Scriptures, nor the power of God.

## Matthew 22:30

For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.

## Matthew 22:31

But regarding the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God:

## Matthew 22:32

‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’?  
He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.”

## Matthew 22:33

When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at His teaching.

---

## Matthew 22:34

Now when the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together.

## Matthew 22:35

And one of them, a lawyer, asked Him a question, to test Him:

## Matthew 22:36

“Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?”

## Matthew 22:37

And He said to him,  
“‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.’

## Matthew 22:38

This is the great and foremost commandment.

## Matthew 22:39

The second is like it, ‘You shall love your neighbour as yourself.’

## Matthew 22:40

Upon these two commandments hang the whole Law and the Prophets.”

---

## Matthew 22:41

Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question:

## Matthew 22:42

“What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is He?”  
They said to Him, “The son of David.”

## Matthew 22:43

He said to them,  
“Then how does David in the Spirit call Him ‘Lord,’ saying,

## Matthew 22:44

> ‘The Lord said to my Lord,  
> “Sit at My right hand,  
> Until I put Your enemies
> under Your feet”’?

## Matthew 22:45

Therefore, if David calls Him ‘Lord,’ how is He his son?”

## Matthew 22:46

And no one was able to offer Him an answer to even one question,  
nor did anyone dare from that day on to ask Him another question.
