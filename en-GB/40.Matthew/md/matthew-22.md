# Matthew Chapter 22

## Matthew 22:1

Jesus addressed them once more using parables, saying:

## Matthew 22:2

“The kingdom of heaven is like a king who arranged a wedding feast for his son.

## Matthew 22:3

He sent his servants to call those who had been invited to the banquet, but they were unwilling to come.

## Matthew 22:4

Once more he sent other servants, saying, ‘Tell those who have been invited: Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fattened cattle are butchered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.’

## Matthew 22:5

But they paid no attention and went away, one to his field, another to his business.

## Matthew 22:6

The others seized his servants, mistreated them, and killed them.

## Matthew 22:7

The king was furious. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.

## Matthew 22:8

Then he informed his servants, ‘The wedding feast is prepared, but those who were invited did not deserve it.

## Matthew 22:9

Go therefore to the main roads and invite to the feast as many as you find.’

## Matthew 22:10

So the servants went out into the streets and gathered all they found, both bad and good, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.

---

## Matthew 22:11

However, when the king entered to see the guests, he observed a man there who was not dressed in wedding attire.

## Matthew 22:12

He asked, ‘Friend, how did you get in here without wedding clothes?’ The man was speechless.

## Matthew 22:13

Then the king told the attendants, ‘Bind him hand and foot, and throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’

## Matthew 22:14

For many receive the call, but few are chosen.

---

## Matthew 22:15

Then the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might trap him in his words.

## Matthew 22:16

They sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are truthful and teach the way of God in truth, and you do not care about anyone’s opinion, for you are not swayed by appearances.

## Matthew 22:17

Tell us then, what is your opinion? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?”

## Matthew 22:18

But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, “Why are you testing me, you hypocrites?

## Matthew 22:19

Present to me the coin used for the tax.” They brought him a denarius,

## Matthew 22:20

and he asked them, “Whose image and inscription is this?”

## Matthew 22:21

“Caesar’s,” they replied. Then he said to them, “Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”

## Matthew 22:22

Upon hearing this, they were astonished, and they left him and went away.

---

## Matthew 22:23

On that same day, the Sadducees, who deny the resurrection, approached him with a question.

## Matthew 22:24

“Teacher,” they said, “Moses said, ‘If a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow and raise up offspring for him.’

## Matthew 22:25

Now there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died, and having no children, left his wife to his brother.

## Matthew 22:26

The same happened with the second and third brother, down to the seventh.

## Matthew 22:27

Eventually, the woman died.

## Matthew 22:28

In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife will she be of the seven, since all of them were married to her?”

## Matthew 22:29

Jesus replied, “You are mistaken, because you do not know the Scriptures nor the power of God.

## Matthew 22:30

For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like the angels in heaven.

## Matthew 22:31

But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what God said to you,

## Matthew 22:32

‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? He is the God of the living, not the dead.”

## Matthew 22:33

The crowds heard this and were amazed at his teaching.

---

## Matthew 22:34

When the Pharisees learned that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together.

## Matthew 22:35

One of them, a scholar of the law, tested him with this question:

## Matthew 22:36

“Teacher, which commandment is the greatest in the Law?”

## Matthew 22:37

Jesus replied, “‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’

## Matthew 22:38

This is the foremost and greatest commandment.

## Matthew 22:39

And the second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbour as yourself.’

## Matthew 22:40

These two commandments are the foundation of all the Law and the Prophets.”

---

## Matthew 22:41

As the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,

## Matthew 22:42

“What do you think about the Messiah? Whose son is he?” They replied, “The son of David.”

## Matthew 22:43

He said to them, “Then how is it that David, inspired by the Spirit, calls him ‘Lord’? For he says,

## Matthew 22:44

> ‘The Lord said to my Lord:
> “Sit at my right hand
> until I make your enemies
> a footstool for your feet.”’

## Matthew 22:45

If David calls him ‘Lord,’ in what way can he be his son?”

## Matthew 22:46

No one could respond with a word, and from that day on no one dared to question him further.
