# Matthew Chapter 7

## Matthew 7:1

“Do not judge, lest you too be judged.

## Matthew 7:2

For in the manner you judge others, you will be judged, and by the measure you use, it will be measured to you.

## Matthew 7:3

Why do you observe the speck in your brother’s eye, but fail to notice the plank in your own eye?

## Matthew 7:4

How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me remove the speck from your eye,’ while there is a plank in your own eye?

## Matthew 7:5

You hypocrite, first remove the plank from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.

## Matthew 7:6

“Do not give what is holy to dogs, and do not cast your pearls before pigs, or they may trample them underfoot, and turn and tear you apart.

## Matthew 7:7

“Ask, and it shall be given to you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and the door shall be opened to you.

## Matthew 7:8

For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, it will be opened.

## Matthew 7:9

Which of you, if your son asks for bread, would give him a stone?

## Matthew 7:10

Or if he asks for a fish, would give him a snake?

## Matthew 7:11

If you, then, though flawed, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!

## Matthew 7:12

Therefore, in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this is the Law and the Prophets.

## Matthew 7:13

“Enter through the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the path that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.

## Matthew 7:14

But small is the gate and narrow the path that leads to life, and only a few find it.

## Matthew 7:15

“Be cautious of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but are inwardly ravenous wolves.

## Matthew 7:16

By their fruits you will recognise them. Do people gather grapes from thorn bushes, or figs from thistles?

## Matthew 7:17

Similarly, a good tree produces good fruit, but a bad tree produces bad fruit.

## Matthew 7:18

A good tree does not produce bad fruit, nor can a bad tree give good fruit.

## Matthew 7:19

Every tree that fails to produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.

## Matthew 7:20

Thus, by their fruits you will recognise them.

## Matthew 7:21

“Not everyone who calls out to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of my Father who is in heaven.

## Matthew 7:22

On that day, many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, drive out demons, and perform many miracles in your name?’

## Matthew 7:23

Then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you who practise lawlessness.’

---

## Matthew 7:24

“Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and acts on them is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.

## Matthew 7:25

The rain fell, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it was founded on the rock.

## Matthew 7:26

But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not act on them is like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.

## Matthew 7:27

The rain fell, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash.”

## Matthew 7:28

When Jesus had finished these sayings, the crowds were amazed at his teaching;

## Matthew 7:29

for he taught as one having authority, and not as their scribes.
