# Matthew Chapter 21

## Matthew 21:1

As they neared Jerusalem and arrived at Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,

## Matthew 21:2

instructing them, “Go into the village in front of you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, with a colt beside her. Untie them and bring them to me.

## Matthew 21:3

If anyone questions you, say, ‘The Lord requires them,’ and he will send them without delay.”

## Matthew 21:4

This happened to fulfil what was spoken through the prophet:

## Matthew 21:5

“Tell the daughter of Zion, ‘Behold, your king comes to you, gentle and mounted on a donkey, even on a colt, the foal of a donkey.’”

## Matthew 21:6

The disciples went and did just as Jesus had directed them.

## Matthew 21:7

They brought the donkey and the colt and placed their cloaks on them, and Jesus sat on them.

## Matthew 21:8

A large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and laid them on the road.

## Matthew 21:9

The crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed were shouting, “Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!”

## Matthew 21:10

When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the entire city was stirred, asking, “Who is this?”

## Matthew 21:11

The crowds replied, “This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee.”

## Matthew 21:12

Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those selling doves.

## Matthew 21:13

And he told them, “It is written: ‘My house will be called a house of prayer,’ but you have made it a ‘den of robbers.’”

## Matthew 21:14

The blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them.

## Matthew 21:15

But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things he did, and the children shouting in the temple courts, “Hosanna to the Son of David,” they became indignant.

## Matthew 21:16

“Do you hear what these children are saying?” they asked him. “Yes,” replied Jesus, “have you never read, ‘From the mouths of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise for yourself’?”

## Matthew 21:17

Then he left them and went out of the city to Bethany, where he spent the night.

## Matthew 21:18

Early in the morning, as Jesus was returning to the city, he became hungry.

## Matthew 21:19

Seeing a fig tree by the road, he approached it but found nothing on it except leaves. He said to it, “May you never bear fruit again!” Immediately the tree withered.

## Matthew 21:20

When the disciples saw this, they were amazed and asked, “How did the fig tree wither so quickly?”

## Matthew 21:21

Jesus answered, “Truly I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and cast into the sea,’ it will happen.

## Matthew 21:22

And whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.”

---

## Matthew 21:23

When Jesus entered the temple courts, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching and asked, “By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?”

## Matthew 21:24

Jesus replied, “I will also ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things.

## Matthew 21:25

The baptism of John, where was it from? From heaven or from men?” They discussed it among themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask, ‘Then why did you not believe him?’

## Matthew 21:26

But if we say, ‘From men,’ we fear the people, for they all consider John a prophet.”

## Matthew 21:27

So they answered Jesus, “We do not know.” Then he said, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.

## Matthew 21:28

“What do you think? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, ‘Son, go and work today in the vineyard.’

## Matthew 21:29

‘I will not,’ he answered, but afterward he reconsidered and went.

## Matthew 21:30

The father went to the other son and said the same thing. He answered, ‘I will, sir,’ but he did not go.

## Matthew 21:31

Which of the two did what his father wanted?” “The first,” they answered. Jesus said to them, “Truly I say to you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of God before you.

## Matthew 21:32

For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did. And even after seeing this, you did not change your minds and believe him.

## Matthew 21:33

“Listen to another parable: There was a landowner who planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug a winepress in it, and built a watchtower. Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and went on a journey.

## Matthew 21:34

When the time for harvest approached, he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his share of the produce.

## Matthew 21:35

The tenants seized his servants; they beat one, killed another, and stoned a third.

## Matthew 21:36

He sent other servants, more than the first time, and the tenants treated them the same way.

## Matthew 21:37

Finally, he sent his son to them, thinking, ‘They will show respect to my son.’

## Matthew 21:38

But when the tenants saw the son, they said to each other, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and seize his inheritance.’

## Matthew 21:39

So they took him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.

## Matthew 21:40

So, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?”

## Matthew 21:41

They answered, “He will bring those wretches to a wretched end and lease the vineyard to other tenants, who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time.”

## Matthew 21:42

Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the Scriptures: ‘The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; the Lord has done this, and it is wonderful in our eyes’?

## Matthew 21:43

Therefore I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will yield its produce.

## Matthew 21:44

Anyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; anyone on whom it falls will be crushed.”

## Matthew 21:45

When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard Jesus’ parables, they realised he was speaking about them.

## Matthew 21:46

They looked for a way to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowds, because the people regarded him as a prophet.
