# Matthew Chapter 18

## Matthew 18:1

At that time, the disciples approached Jesus and asked, “Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?”

## Matthew 18:2

He called a child to Himself and placed the child among them.

## Matthew 18:3

And He said, “Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.

## Matthew 18:4

Therefore, whoever humbles themselves like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.

## Matthew 18:5

And whoever receives a child like this in My name, receives Me.

## Matthew 18:6

But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it would be better for them to have a heavy millstone hung around their neck and be drowned in the depths of the sea.

## Matthew 18:7

“Woe to the world because of the things that cause people to stumble! Such things are bound to come, but woe to the person through whom they come!

## Matthew 18:8

If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire.

## Matthew 18:9

And if your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell.

## Matthew 18:10

“Be careful not to look down on one of these little ones. For I tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of My Father in heaven.

## Matthew 18:11

[For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost.]

## Matthew 18:12

“What do you think? If a man owns a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go to look for the one that is lost?

## Matthew 18:13

And if he finds it, truly I tell you, he rejoices over that one sheep more than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray.

## Matthew 18:14

In the same way, it is not the will of your Father in heaven that any of these little ones should perish.

## Matthew 18:15

“If your brother or sister sins, go and show them their fault in private; if they listen to you, you have won them over.

## Matthew 18:16

But if they do not listen, take one or two others along, so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.

## Matthew 18:17

If they refuse to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if they refuse to listen even to the church, treat them as you would a Gentile or a tax collector.

## Matthew 18:18

“Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound for you in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed for you in heaven.

## Matthew 18:19

“Furthermore, truly I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything they ask for, it will be granted to them by My Father in heaven.

## Matthew 18:20

For where two or three gather in My name, I am there with them.”

---

## Matthew 18:21

Then Peter approached Jesus and asked, “Lord, how many times should I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?”

## Matthew 18:22

Jesus replied, “I tell you, not just seven times, but seventy-seven times.

## Matthew 18:23

“For this reason, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who decided to settle accounts with his servants.

## Matthew 18:24

As he began the settlement, a man who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him.

## Matthew 18:25

Since he was unable to pay, the master ordered that he, his wife, his children, and all he had be sold to repay the debt.

## Matthew 18:26

The servant fell to his knees before him. ‘Please be patient with me,’ he pleaded, ‘and I will repay everything.’

## Matthew 18:27

The master of that servant took pity on him, cancelled the debt and let him go.

## Matthew 18:28

But when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii. He seized him and began to choke him. ‘Pay back what you owe me!’ he demanded.

## Matthew 18:29

His fellow servant fell to his knees and pleaded with him, ‘Please be patient with me, and I will repay it.’

## Matthew 18:30

But he refused. Instead, he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could settle the debt.

## Matthew 18:31

When the other servants saw what had occurred, they were outraged and went and informed their master of everything that had taken place.

## Matthew 18:32

Then the master called the servant in. ‘You wicked servant,’ he said, ‘I cancelled all that debt of yours because you pleaded with me.

## Matthew 18:33

Shouldn’t you have shown mercy to your fellow servant just as I showed to you?’

## Matthew 18:34

In his anger, the master handed him over to the jailers to be tortured until he could repay all he owed.

## Matthew 18:35

“In the same way, My heavenly Father will deal with each of you unless you forgive your brother or sister from your heart.”
