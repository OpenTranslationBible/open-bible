# Matthew Chapter 20

## Matthew 20:1

“For the kingdom of heaven can be compared to a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.

## Matthew 20:2

After agreeing with the labourers for a denarius for the day, he sent them into his vineyard.

## Matthew 20:3

Around the third hour he went out and saw others standing idle in the marketplace.

## Matthew 20:4

He said to them, ‘You also go into the vineyard, and I will pay you whatever is right.’ So they went.

## Matthew 20:5

He went out again about the sixth and the ninth hour and did the same.

## Matthew 20:6

And around the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing around. He asked them, ‘Why have you been standing here idle all day?’

## Matthew 20:7

They replied, ‘Because no one has hired us.’ He said to them, ‘You also go into the vineyard.’

## Matthew 20:8

When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, ‘Call the labourers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last and ending with the first.’

## Matthew 20:9

The workers who were hired about the eleventh hour came and each received a denarius.

## Matthew 20:10

When those hired first came, they expected to receive more, but each of them also received a denarius.

## Matthew 20:11

Upon receiving it, they began to grumble against the landowner.

## Matthew 20:12

They said, ‘These last ones worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.’

## Matthew 20:13

But he replied to one of them, ‘Friend, I am not being unfair to you. Did you not agree with me for a denarius?

## Matthew 20:14

Take what is yours and go. I wish to give to this last one the same as I gave to you.

## Matthew 20:15

Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with my own money? Or is your eye envious because I am generous?’

## Matthew 20:16

In this way, the last will be first, and the first will be last.”

## Matthew 20:17

As Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside and said to them,

## Matthew 20:18

“We are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death.

## Matthew 20:19

They will hand him over to the Gentiles to mock, flog, and crucify him, and on the third day he will be raised to life.”

## Matthew 20:20

Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee approached Jesus with her sons, kneeling down and making a request of him.

## Matthew 20:21

He asked her, “What do you wish?” She replied, “Grant that these two sons of mine may sit, one at your right and one at your left, in your kingdom.”

## Matthew 20:22

Jesus responded, “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?” They said to him, “We are able.”

## Matthew 20:23

He said to them, “You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These places are for those for whom they have been prepared by my Father.”

## Matthew 20:24

When the ten heard about this, they were upset with the two brothers.

## Matthew 20:25

Jesus called them together and said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles domineer over them, and their high officials exercise authority over them.

## Matthew 20:26

It shall not be so among you. Whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,

## Matthew 20:27

and whoever wants to be first must be your servant—

## Matthew 20:28

just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”

## Matthew 20:29

As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him.

## Matthew 20:30

Two blind men were sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!”

## Matthew 20:31

The crowd rebuked them and told them to be quiet, but they shouted all the more, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!”

## Matthew 20:32

Jesus stopped and called them over. “What do you want me to do for you?” he asked.

## Matthew 20:33

They said to him, “Lord, we want our sight.”

## Matthew 20:34

Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes, and immediately they received their sight and followed him.
