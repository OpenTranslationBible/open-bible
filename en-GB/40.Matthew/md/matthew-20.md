# Matthew Chapter 20

## Matthew 20:1

“For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning  
to hire labourers for his vineyard.

## Matthew 20:2

And when he had agreed with the labourers for a denarius for the day, he sent them into his vineyard.

## Matthew 20:3

And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace;

## Matthew 20:4

and to those he said, ‘You go into the vineyard also, and whatever is right, I will give you.’  
And so they went.

## Matthew 20:5

Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did the same thing.

## Matthew 20:6

And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing around,  
and he said to them, ‘Why have you been standing here idle all day long?’

## Matthew 20:7

They said to him, ‘Because no one hired us.’  
He said to them, ‘You go into the vineyard too.’

## Matthew 20:8

Now when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman,  
‘Call the labourers and pay them their wages, starting with the last group to the first.’

## Matthew 20:9

When those hired about the eleventh hour came, they each received a denarius.

## Matthew 20:10

And so when those hired first came, they thought that they would receive more;  
but each of them also received a denarius.

## Matthew 20:11

When they received it, they grumbled against the landowner,

## Matthew 20:12

saying,  
‘These who were hired last worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us  
who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.’

## Matthew 20:13

But he answered and said to one of them,  
‘Friend, I am doing you no wrong; did you not agree with me for a denarius?

## Matthew 20:14

Take what is yours and go; but I want to give to this last person the same as to you.

## Matthew 20:15

Is it not lawful for me to do what I want with what is my own?  
Or is your eye envious because I am generous?’

## Matthew 20:16

So the last shall be first, and the first, last.”

## Matthew 20:17

As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, He took the twelve disciples aside by themselves,  
and on the way He said to them,

## Matthew 20:18

“Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem;  
and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes,  
and they will condemn Him to death,

## Matthew 20:19

and they will hand Him over to the Gentiles to mock and flog and crucify,  
and on the third day He will be raised.”

## Matthew 20:20

Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Him with her sons,  
bowing down and making a request of Him.

## Matthew 20:21

And He said to her, “What do you desire?”  
She said to Him,  
“Say that in Your kingdom these two sons of mine shall sit, one at Your right and one at Your left.”

## Matthew 20:22

But Jesus replied,  
“You do not know what you are asking.  
Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?”  
They said to Him, “We are able.”

## Matthew 20:23

He said to them,  
“My cup you shall drink; but to sit at My right and at My left is not Mine to give,  
but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by My Father.”

## Matthew 20:24

And after hearing this, the other ten disciples became indignant with the two brothers.

## Matthew 20:25

But Jesus called them to Himself and said,  
“You know that the rulers of the Gentiles domineer over them,  
and those in high position exercise authority over them.

## Matthew 20:26

It is not this way among you,  
but whoever wants to become prominent among you shall be your servant,

## Matthew 20:27

and whoever desires to be first among you shall be your slave;

## Matthew 20:28

just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve,  
and to give His life as a ransom for many.”

## Matthew 20:29

As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed Him.

## Matthew 20:30

And two people who were blind, sitting by the road, hearing that Jesus was passing by,  
cried out,  
“Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!”

## Matthew 20:31

But the crowd sternly warned them to be quiet;  
yet they cried out all the more,  
“Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!”

## Matthew 20:32

And Jesus stopped and called them, and said,  
“What do you want Me to do for you?”

## Matthew 20:33

They said to Him,  
“Lord, we want our eyes to be opened.”

## Matthew 20:34

Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes;  
and immediately they regained their sight and followed Him.
