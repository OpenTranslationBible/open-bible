# Matthew Chapter 28

## Matthew 28:1

After the Sabbath, as dawn approached on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to view the tomb.

## Matthew 28:2

Behold, a severe earthquake occurred, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, rolled away the stone, and sat upon it.

## Matthew 28:3

His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing was as white as snow.

## Matthew 28:4

The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.

## Matthew 28:5

The angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.

## Matthew 28:6

He is not here; He has risen, just as He said. Come, see the place where He lay.

## Matthew 28:7

Then go quickly and tell His disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see Him.’ Behold, I have told you.”

## Matthew 28:8

So they quickly left the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to tell His disciples.

## Matthew 28:9

Suddenly Jesus met them and said, “Greetings!” They approached Him, took hold of His feet, and worshipped Him.

## Matthew 28:10

Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid. Go and tell My brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see Me.”

## Matthew 28:11

While they were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened.

## Matthew 28:12

When the chief priests had met with the elders and devised a plan, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,

## Matthew 28:13

instructing them, “You are to say, ‘His disciples came during the night and stole Him away while we were asleep.’

## Matthew 28:14

If this reaches the governor’s ears, we will appease him and keep you out of trouble.”

## Matthew 28:15

So they took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story has been widely circulated among the Jews to this day.

## Matthew 28:16

Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had directed them.

## Matthew 28:17

When they saw Him, they worshipped Him; but some doubted.

## Matthew 28:18

Then Jesus approached and spoke to them, saying, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me.

## Matthew 28:19

Therefore, go and make disciples of all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,

## Matthew 28:20

teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”
