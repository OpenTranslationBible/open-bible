# Matthew Chapter 5

## Matthew 5:1

When Jesus observed the crowds, He ascended a mountainside and sat down. His disciples approached Him,

## Matthew 5:2

and He began to instruct them, saying:

## Matthew 5:3

> “Blessed are the poor in spirit,
> for the kingdom of heaven is theirs.

## Matthew 5:4

> Blessed are those who mourn,
> for they shall receive comfort.

## Matthew 5:5

> Blessed are the gentle,
> for they shall inherit the earth.

## Matthew 5:6

> Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,
> for they shall be satisfied.

## Matthew 5:7

> Blessed are the merciful,
> for they shall obtain mercy.

## Matthew 5:8

> Blessed are the pure in heart,
> for they shall see God.

## Matthew 5:9

> Blessed are the peacemakers,
> for they shall be called the children of God.

## Matthew 5:10

> Blessed are those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness,
> for the kingdom of heaven is theirs.

## Matthew 5:11

Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you, and falsely speak all kinds of evil against you because of Me.

## Matthew 5:12

Be joyful and glad, for your reward in heaven is great; for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.

## Matthew 5:13

You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its flavour, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by others.

## Matthew 5:14

You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.

## Matthew 5:15

Nor do people light a lamp and place it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house.

## Matthew 5:16

In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.

## Matthew 5:17

Do not think that I have come to do away with the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to do away with them but to complete them.

## Matthew 5:18

For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.

## Matthew 5:19

Therefore, whoever sets aside one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

## Matthew 5:20

For I say to you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.

## Matthew 5:21

You have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not murder, and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.’

## Matthew 5:22

But I say to you, anyone who is angry with a brother or sister will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to a brother or sister, ‘Raca,’ will be answerable to the court. And anyone who says, ‘You fool!’ will be in danger of the fiery hell.

## Matthew 5:23

Therefore, if you are presenting your offering at the altar and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you,

## Matthew 5:24

leave your offering there in front of the altar. First, be reconciled to them; then come and present your offering.

## Matthew 5:25

Settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court. Do it while you are still on the way, or your adversary may hand you over to the judge, and the judge may hand you over to the officer, and you may be thrown into prison.

## Matthew 5:26

Truly I say to you, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny.

---

## Matthew 5:27

You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’

## Matthew 5:28

But I say to you, anyone who looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart.

## Matthew 5:29

If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.

## Matthew 5:30

And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.

---

## Matthew 5:31

It has been said, ‘Anyone who divorces his wife must provide her with a certificate of divorce.’

## Matthew 5:32

But I say to you, anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, makes her commit adultery, and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.

---

## Matthew 5:33

Again, you have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘Do not break your oath, but fulfil your vows to the Lord.’

## Matthew 5:34

But I say to you, do not swear at all: neither by heaven, for it is God’s throne;

## Matthew 5:35

nor by the earth, for it is His footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.

## Matthew 5:36

And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black.

## Matthew 5:37

Let your statement be, ‘Yes, yes’ or ‘No, no’; anything beyond this is from the evil one.

---

## Matthew 5:38

You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.’

## Matthew 5:39

But I say to you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also.

## Matthew 5:40

And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, let them have your coat as well.

## Matthew 5:41

If anyone compels you to go one mile, go with them two miles.

## Matthew 5:42

Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wishes to borrow from you.

---

## Matthew 5:43

You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbour and hate your adversary.’

## Matthew 5:44

But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,

## Matthew 5:45

so that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes His sun to rise on both the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.

## Matthew 5:46

If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?

## Matthew 5:47

And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?

## Matthew 5:48

Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
