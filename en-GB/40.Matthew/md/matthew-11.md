# Matthew Chapter 11

## Matthew 11:1

After Jesus had completed instructing his twelve disciples, he moved on from there to teach and preach in their towns.

## Matthew 11:2

While John was in prison, he heard about the works of Christ, and sent his disciples

## Matthew 11:3

to ask him, “Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?”

## Matthew 11:4

Jesus responded, “Go back and report to John what you hear and see:

## Matthew 11:5

The blind receive their sight, the lame walk, those with leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is announced to the poor.

## Matthew 11:6

Blessed is anyone who does not take offence at me.”

## Matthew 11:7

As John's disciples were departing, Jesus began to address the crowd about John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?

## Matthew 11:8

If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? No, those who wear soft clothing are in kings’ palaces.

## Matthew 11:9

But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.

## Matthew 11:10

This is the one spoken of in the scriptures: Behold, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.’

## Matthew 11:11

Truly I tell you, among those born of women there has not arisen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.

## Matthew 11:12

From the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven has been subjected to violence, and violent people take it by force.

## Matthew 11:13

For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John.

## Matthew 11:14

And if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who was to come.

## Matthew 11:15

Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.

## Matthew 11:16

“To what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces, calling out to others:

## Matthew 11:17

> ‘We played the flute for you,
> and you did not dance;
> we sang a dirge,
> and you did not mourn.’

## Matthew 11:18

For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon.’

## Matthew 11:19

The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.’ Yet wisdom is justified by her deeds.”

## Matthew 11:20

Then Jesus began to denounce the towns where most of his miracles had been performed, because they did not repent.

## Matthew 11:21

“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.

## Matthew 11:22

But I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgement than for you.

## Matthew 11:23

And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to the heavens? No, you will go down to Hades. For if the miracles that were performed in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.

## Matthew 11:24

But I tell you that it will be more tolerable for Sodom on the day of judgement than for you.”

---

## Matthew 11:25

At that time Jesus said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent, and revealed them to little children.

## Matthew 11:26

Yes, Father, for this was well pleasing in your sight.

## Matthew 11:27

All things have been entrusted to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.

---

## Matthew 11:28

“Come to me, all you who are tired and carrying heavy burdens, and I will give you rest.

## Matthew 11:29

Accept my guidance and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.

## Matthew 11:30

For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”
