# Matthew Chapter 16

## Matthew 16:1

The Pharisees and Sadducees approached Jesus, testing Him by requesting a sign from heaven.

## Matthew 16:2

He responded, “In the evening you say, ‘It will be fair weather, for the sky is red,’

## Matthew 16:3

and in the morning, ‘Today it will be stormy, for the sky is red and threatening.’ You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but can you not discern the signs of the times?

## Matthew 16:4

A wicked and adulterous generation seeks a sign, but none shall be given except the sign of Jonah.” And He left them and went away.

## Matthew 16:5

As the disciples went across to the other side of the sea, they realised they had forgotten to bring bread.

## Matthew 16:6

Jesus cautioned them, “Be careful and stay alert against the influence of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”

## Matthew 16:7

They discussed this among themselves, saying, “It is because we did not bring any bread.”

## Matthew 16:8

Aware of their discussion, Jesus said, “You of little faith, why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread?

## Matthew 16:9

Do you not yet understand? Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you collected?

## Matthew 16:10

Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many large baskets you gathered?

## Matthew 16:11

How is it that you do not understand that I was not speaking to you about bread? But be on your guard against the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”

## Matthew 16:12

Then they understood that He was not telling them to beware of the leaven used in bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

## Matthew 16:13

When Jesus arrived in the region of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, “Who do people say the Son of Man is?”

## Matthew 16:14

They answered, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”

## Matthew 16:15

He said to them, “But what about you? Who do you say I am?”

## Matthew 16:16

Simon Peter replied, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.”

## Matthew 16:17

Jesus replied, “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by human means, but by My Father in heaven.

## Matthew 16:18

And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it.

## Matthew 16:19

I will entrust you with the authority of the kingdom of heaven; what you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and what you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.”

## Matthew 16:20

Then He ordered His disciples not to tell anyone that He was the Christ.

## Matthew 16:21

From that time on, Jesus began to explain to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and that He must be killed and on the third day be raised to life.

## Matthew 16:22

Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him. “God forbid it, Lord!” he said. “This shall never happen to You!”

## Matthew 16:23

But Jesus turned and said to Peter, “Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me; you do not have in mind the concerns of God, but merely human concerns.”

## Matthew 16:24

Then Jesus said to His disciples, “If anyone wants to follow Me, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow Me.

## Matthew 16:25

For whoever seeks to preserve his life will lose it, but whoever gives up his life for My sake will discover it.

## Matthew 16:26

What good will it be for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his soul? Or what can anyone give in exchange for his soul?

## Matthew 16:27

For the Son of Man is going to come in His Father’s glory with His angels, and then He will reward each person according to their deeds.

## Matthew 16:28

“Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not experience death before they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.”
