# Matthew Chapter 6

## Matthew 6:1

“Be cautious not to display your righteousness before others to be noticed by them; otherwise, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.

## Matthew 6:2

“So when you give to the poor, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be praised by others. Truly, I tell you, they have received their reward in full.

## Matthew 6:3

But when you give to those in need, do so discreetly, without drawing attention to yourself,

## Matthew 6:4

so that your giving may remain private. Then your Father, who observes what is done quietly, will reward you.

## Matthew 6:5

“And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly, I tell you, they have their reward in full.

## Matthew 6:6

But when you pray, go into your room, close the door, and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who observes what is done quietly, will reward you.

## Matthew 6:7

And when you pray, do not use thoughtless repetition like the pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words.

## Matthew 6:8

Do not imitate them: your Father is aware of your needs even before you ask Him.

## Matthew 6:9

“Pray in this way:

> ‘Our Father in heaven,
> hallowed be Your name,

## Matthew 6:10

> Your kingdom come,
> Let Your will be done,
> on earth as it is in heaven.

## Matthew 6:11

> Grant us this day our daily bread.

## Matthew 6:12

> And forgive us our sins,
> as we forgive those who sin against us.

## Matthew 6:13

> And lead us not into temptation,
> but deliver us from evil.’

---

## Matthew 6:14

For if you forgive others when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.

## Matthew 6:15

But if you do not forgive others, your Father will not forgive you either.

---

## Matthew 6:16

“When you fast, do not look gloomy as the hypocrites do, for they distort their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly, I tell you, they have received their reward in full.

## Matthew 6:17

But when you fast, take care of your appearance by anointing your head and washing your face,

## Matthew 6:18

so that your fasting is not obvious to others, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who observes what is done quietly, will reward you.

---

## Matthew 6:19

“Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.

## Matthew 6:20

Instead, gather treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal.

## Matthew 6:21

For wherever your treasure is, there your heart will be as well.

---

## Matthew 6:22

“The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are clear, your whole body will be full of light.

## Matthew 6:23

But if your eyes are not clear, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!

## Matthew 6:24

“No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and wealth.

---

## Matthew 6:25

“That is why I say to you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or drink, or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?

## Matthew 6:26

Observe the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?

## Matthew 6:27

Can any of you, by worrying, extend your life by even a single hour?

## Matthew 6:28

“And why do you worry about clothing? Consider how the flowers of the field grow. They do not labour or spin,

## Matthew 6:29

yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendour was dressed like one of these.

## Matthew 6:30

If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is cast into the fire, will He not much more clothe you—you of little faith?

---

## Matthew 6:31

So do not be anxious, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’

## Matthew 6:32

For the pagans eagerly seek all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.

## Matthew 6:33

But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be provided to you as well.

## Matthew 6:34

Therefore, do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will take care of itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
