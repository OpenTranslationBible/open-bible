# Matthew Chapter 26

## Matthew 26:1

When Jesus had finished all these sayings, he spoke to his disciples,

## Matthew 26:2

“You know that in two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.”

---

## Matthew 26:3

At that time, the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the courtyard of the high priest, named Caiaphas,

## Matthew 26:4

and they plotted together to arrest Jesus secretly and put him to death.

## Matthew 26:5

But they said, “Not during the festival, otherwise there might be a riot among the people.”

---

## Matthew 26:6

While Jesus was in Bethany, at the home of Simon, known as the leper,

## Matthew 26:7

a woman approached him with an alabaster jar of very costly perfume, and she poured it on his head as he reclined at the table.

## Matthew 26:8

When the disciples saw this, they were upset and asked, “Why this waste?

## Matthew 26:9

This perfume could have been sold for a high price and the money given to the poor.”

## Matthew 26:10

But Jesus, aware of this, said to them, “Why are you troubling the woman? She has done a good deed for me.

## Matthew 26:11

For you will always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.

## Matthew 26:12

By pouring this perfume on my body, she has done it in preparation for my burial.

## Matthew 26:13

Truly, I say to you, wherever this gospel is proclaimed throughout the world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.”

---

## Matthew 26:14

Then Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went to the chief priests

## Matthew 26:15

and said, “What are you willing to give me to betray him to you?” And they counted out thirty pieces of silver for him.

## Matthew 26:16

From that moment, he sought a good opportunity to betray Jesus.

---

## Matthew 26:17

On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?”

## Matthew 26:18

He instructed them, “Go into the city and find a certain man. Tell him, ‘The Teacher says: My time is near; I am to share the Passover at your house with my disciples.’”

## Matthew 26:19

The disciples did as Jesus had instructed them and prepared the Passover.

---

## Matthew 26:20

When evening arrived, Jesus was at the table with the twelve disciples.

## Matthew 26:21

And during the meal, he said, “Truly, I tell you, one of you will betray me.”

## Matthew 26:22

They were deeply grieved and began to say to him, one after another, “Surely it is not I, Lord?”

## Matthew 26:23

He answered, “He who has dipped his hand with me in the bowl is the one who will betray me.

## Matthew 26:24

The Son of Man is going just as it is written about him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for him if he had not been born.”

## Matthew 26:25

Judas, who was betraying him, said, “Surely it is not I, Rabbi?” Jesus said to him, “You have said it yourself.”

---

## Matthew 26:26

While they were eating, Jesus took some bread, and after blessing it, he broke it and gave it to the disciples, saying, “Take, eat; this is my body.”

## Matthew 26:27

And he took a cup, and after giving thanks, he gave it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you;

## Matthew 26:28

for this represents my blood of the covenant, which is shed for many for the forgiveness of sins.

## Matthew 26:29

But I tell you, I will not drink from this fruit of the vine again until that day when I drink it anew with you in my Father’s kingdom.”

## Matthew 26:30

After they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.

---

## Matthew 26:31

Then Jesus said to them, “This night you will all fall away because of me, for it is written:

> ‘I will strike the shepherd,
> and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’

## Matthew 26:32

However, once I have risen, I will go ahead of you to Galilee.”

## Matthew 26:33

Peter replied to him, “Even if all fall away because of you, I will never fall away!”

## Matthew 26:34

Jesus said to him, “Truly I say to you, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.”

## Matthew 26:35

Peter said to him, “Even if I have to die with you, I will not deny you!” All the disciples said the same thing.

---

## Matthew 26:36

Then Jesus arrived with them at a place called Gethsemane, and told his disciples, “Sit here while I go over there and pray.”

## Matthew 26:37

He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with him, and began to be sorrowful and troubled.

## Matthew 26:38

Then he said to them, “My soul is deeply grieved, to the point of death; stay here and keep watch with me.”

## Matthew 26:39

He went a little farther, fell on his face, and prayed, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; yet not as I will, but as you will.”

## Matthew 26:40

He came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, “So, you could not keep watch with me for one hour?

## Matthew 26:41

Keep watching and praying, so that you do not fall into temptation; the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”

## Matthew 26:42

He went away again a second time and prayed, “My Father, if this cup cannot pass away unless I drink it, your will be done.”

## Matthew 26:43

Once more, he returned and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.

## Matthew 26:44

He left them again, went away, and prayed a third time, saying the same thing once more.

## Matthew 26:45

Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.

## Matthew 26:46

Get up, let us go; see, the one who is betraying me is near!”

---

## Matthew 26:47

While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived, accompanied by a large crowd with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people.

## Matthew 26:48

Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, “The one I kiss is the man; arrest him.”

## Matthew 26:49

Immediately Judas went up to Jesus and said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed him.

## Matthew 26:50

Jesus said to him, “Friend, do what you have come for.” Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and arrested him.

## Matthew 26:51

And behold, one of those with Jesus reached for his sword, drew it, and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.

## Matthew 26:52

Then Jesus said to him, “Put your sword back in its place; for all who take up the sword will perish by the sword.

## Matthew 26:53

Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels?

## Matthew 26:54

If it were not so, how would the Scriptures be fulfilled, which say that it must happen this way?”

## Matthew 26:55

At that time Jesus said to the crowds, “Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as if I were leading a rebellion? Every day I sat in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me.

## Matthew 26:56

But all this has occurred so that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples left him and fled.

---

## Matthew 26:57

Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.

## Matthew 26:58

But Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest, and went inside and sat down with the guards to see the outcome.

## Matthew 26:59

The chief priests and the whole council were seeking false testimony against Jesus so that they could put him to death.

## Matthew 26:60

They did not find any, even though many false witnesses came forward. Finally, two came forward

## Matthew 26:61

and declared, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.’”

## Matthew 26:62

The high priest stood up and said to Jesus, “Do you not answer? What is it that these men are testifying against you?”

## Matthew 26:63

But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, “I charge you under oath by the living God, to tell us whether you are the Messiah, the Son of God.”

## Matthew 26:64

Jesus said to him, “You have said it yourself. But I say to all of you: From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.”

## Matthew 26:65

Then the high priest tore his robes and said, “He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy;

## Matthew 26:66

what do you think?” They answered, “He is worthy of death!”

## Matthew 26:67

Then they spat in his face, struck him with their fists, and others slapped him

## Matthew 26:68

and said, “Prophesy to us, Messiah; who is the one who hit you?”

---

## Matthew 26:69

Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him and said, “You also were with Jesus the Galilean.”

## Matthew 26:70

But he denied it in front of everyone, saying, “I do not know what you mean.”

## Matthew 26:71

When he had gone out to the gateway, another servant girl saw him and said to those there, “This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.”

## Matthew 26:72

And once more he denied it, swearing: “I do not know the man.”

## Matthew 26:73

A little later, the bystanders came up and said to Peter, “Surely you are one of them; your accent gives you away.”

## Matthew 26:74

Then he began to curse and swear, “I do not know the man!” Immediately a rooster crowed.

## Matthew 26:75

And Peter recalled the words Jesus had spoken: “Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.” And he went outside and wept bitterly.
