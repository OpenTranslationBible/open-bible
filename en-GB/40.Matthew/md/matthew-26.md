# Matthew Chapter 26

## Matthew 26:1

When Jesus had finished all these statements, He said to His disciples,

## Matthew 26:2

“You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man is to be handed over for crucifixion.”

---

## Matthew 26:3

Then the chief priests and the elders of the people were gathered together  
in the courtyard of the high priest, who was named Caiaphas;

## Matthew 26:4

and they plotted together to arrest Jesus covertly and kill Him.

## Matthew 26:5

But they were saying, “Not during the festival, otherwise a riot might occur among the people.”

---

## Matthew 26:6

Now when Jesus was in Bethany, at the home of Simon the Leper,

## Matthew 26:7

a woman came to Him with an alabaster vial of very expensive perfume,  
and she poured it on His head as He was reclining at the table.

## Matthew 26:8

But the disciples were indignant when they saw this, and said,  
“Why this waste?

## Matthew 26:9

For this perfume could have been sold for a high price and the money given to the poor.”

## Matthew 26:10

But Jesus, aware of this, said to them,  
“Why are you bothering the woman? For she has done a good deed for Me.

## Matthew 26:11

For you always have the poor with you; but you do not always have Me.

## Matthew 26:12

For when she poured this perfume on My body, she did it to prepare Me for burial.

## Matthew 26:13

Truly I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world,  
what this woman has done will also be told in memory of her.”

---

## Matthew 26:14

Then one of the twelve, the one named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests

## Matthew 26:15

and said, “What are you willing to give me to betray Him to you?”  
And they set out for him thirty pieces of silver.

## Matthew 26:16

And from then on he looked for a good opportunity to betray Jesus.

---

## Matthew 26:17

Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus and said,  
“Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the Passover?”

## Matthew 26:18

And He said, “Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him,  
‘The Teacher says, “My time is near; I am to keep the Passover at your house with My disciples.”’”

## Matthew 26:19

The disciples did as Jesus had directed them; and they prepared the Passover.

---

## Matthew 26:20

Now when evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve.

## Matthew 26:21

And as they were eating, He said, “Truly I say to you that one of you will betray Me.”

## Matthew 26:22

Being deeply grieved, they began saying to Him one after another,  
“Surely it is not I, Lord?”

## Matthew 26:23

And He answered,  
“He who dipped his hand with Me in the bowl is the one who will betray Me.

## Matthew 26:24

The Son of Man is going away just as it is written about Him;  
but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed!  
It would have been good for that man if he had not been born.”

## Matthew 26:25

And Judas, who was betraying Him, said,  
“Surely it is not I, Rabbi?”  
Jesus _said to him_, “You have said it yourself.”

---

## Matthew 26:26

Now while they were eating, Jesus took some bread, and after blessing it,  
He broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said,  
“Take, eat; this is My body.”

## Matthew 26:27

And when He had taken a cup and given thanks, He gave it to them, saying,  
“Drink from it, all of you;

## Matthew 26:28

for this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for forgiveness of sins.

## Matthew 26:29

But I say to you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now until that day  
when I drink it with you new in My Father’s kingdom.”

## Matthew 26:30

And after singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.

---

## Matthew 26:31

Then Jesus _said to them_,  
“You will all fall away because of Me this night, for it is written:

> ‘I will strike the Shepherd,
> and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’

## Matthew 26:32

But after I have been raised, I will go ahead of you to Galilee.”

## Matthew 26:33

But Peter replied to Him,  
“Even if they all fall away because of You, I will never fall away!”

## Matthew 26:34

Jesus said to him,  
“Truly I say to you that this very night, before a rooster crows,  
you will deny Me three times.”

## Matthew 26:35

Peter _said to Him_,  
“Even if I have to die with You, I will not deny You!”  
All the disciples said the same thing as well.

---

## Matthew 26:36

Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane,  
and told His disciples, “Sit here while I go over there and pray.”

## Matthew 26:37

And He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with Him, and began to be grieved and distressed.

## Matthew 26:38

Then He _said to them_,  
“My soul is deeply grieved, to the point of death; remain here and keep watch with Me.”

## Matthew 26:39

And He went a little beyond them, and fell on His face and prayed, saying,  
“My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me;  
yet not as I will, but as You will.”

## Matthew 26:40

And He _came_ to the disciples and _found them sleeping_, and He _said to Peter_,  
“So, you men could not keep watch with Me for one hour?

## Matthew 26:41

Keep watching and praying, so that you do not come into temptation;  
the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”

## Matthew 26:42

He went away again a second time and prayed, saying,  
“My Father, if this cup cannot pass away unless I drink from it, Your will be done.”

## Matthew 26:43

Again He came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.

## Matthew 26:44

And He left them again, and went away and prayed a third time,  
saying the same thing once more.

## Matthew 26:45

Then He _came_ to the disciples and _said to them_,  
“Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand  
and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.

## Matthew 26:46

Get up, let’s go; behold, the one who is betraying Me is near!”

---

## Matthew 26:47

While He was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came,  
accompanied by a large crowd with swords and clubs,  
who came from the chief priests and elders of the people.

## Matthew 26:48

Now he who was betraying Him gave them a sign previously, saying,  
“Whomever I kiss, He is the one; arrest Him.”

## Matthew 26:49

And immediately Judas went up to Jesus and said,  
“Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed Him.

## Matthew 26:50

But Jesus said to him, “Friend, do what you have come for.”  
Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and arrested Him.

## Matthew 26:51

And behold, one of those who were with Jesus reached and drew his sword,  
and struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his ear.

## Matthew 26:52

Then Jesus _said to him_,  
“Put your sword back into its place;  
for all those who take up the sword will perish by the sword.

## Matthew 26:53

Or do you think that I cannot appeal to My Father,  
and He will at once put at My disposal more than twelve legions of angels?

## Matthew 26:54

How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled, which say that it must happen this way?”

## Matthew 26:55

At that time Jesus _said to the crowds_,  
“Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest Me, as you would against a man inciting a revolt?  
Every day I used to sit within the temple grounds teaching, and you did not arrest Me.

## Matthew 26:56

But all this has taken place so that the Scriptures of the prophets will be fulfilled.”  
Then all the disciples left Him and fled.

---

## Matthew 26:57

Those who had arrested Jesus led Him away to Caiaphas, the high priest,  
where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.

## Matthew 26:58

But Peter was following Him at a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest,  
and entered, and sat down with the officers to see the outcome.

## Matthew 26:59

Now the chief priests and the entire Council kept trying to obtain false testimony against Jesus,  
so that they might put Him to death.

## Matthew 26:60

And they did not find any,  
even though many false witnesses came forward.  
But later on two came forward,

## Matthew 26:61

and said,  
“This man stated, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and to rebuild it in three days.’”

## Matthew 26:62

And the high priest stood up and said to Him,  
“Do You offer no answer for what these men are testifying against You?”

## Matthew 26:63

But Jesus kept silent.  
And the high priest said to Him,  
“I place You under oath by the living God, to tell us whether You are the Christ, the Son of God.”

## Matthew 26:64

Jesus _said to him_,  
“You have said it yourself.  
But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power,  
and coming on the clouds of heaven.”

## Matthew 26:65

Then the high priest tore his robes and said,  
“He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses?  
See, you have now heard the blasphemy;

## Matthew 26:66

what do you think?”  
They answered,  
“He deserves death!”

## Matthew 26:67

Then they spit in His face and beat Him with their fists;  
and others slapped Him,

## Matthew 26:68

and said,  
“Prophesy to us, You Christ; who is the one who hit You?”

---

## Matthew 26:69

Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard,  
and a slave woman came to him and said,  
“You too were with Jesus the Galilean.”

## Matthew 26:70

But he denied it before them all, saying,  
“I do not know what you are talking about.”

## Matthew 26:71

When he had gone out to the gateway, another slave woman saw him and _said to those who were there_,  
“This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.”

## Matthew 26:72

And again he denied it, with an oath: “I do not know the man.”

## Matthew 26:73

A little later, the bystanders came up and said to Peter,  
“You really are one of them as well, since even the way you talk gives you away.”

## Matthew 26:74

Then he began to curse and swear,  
“I do not know the man!”  
And immediately a rooster crowed.

## Matthew 26:75

And Peter remembered the statement that Jesus had made:  
“Before a rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.”  
And he went out and wept bitterly.
