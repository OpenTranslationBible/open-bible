# Matthew Chapter 12

## Matthew 12:1

At that time, Jesus was walking through the grainfields on the Sabbath, and His disciples, feeling hungry, began to pluck some heads of grain and eat them.

## Matthew 12:2

When the Pharisees observed this, they said to Him, “Look, Your disciples are doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath.”

## Matthew 12:3

He responded, “Have you not read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?

## Matthew 12:4

He went into the house of God, and they ate the consecrated bread, which was not lawful for him or his companions to eat, but only for the priests.

## Matthew 12:5

Or have you not read in the Law that the priests in the temple desecrate the Sabbath, yet remain innocent?

## Matthew 12:6

But I tell you that something greater than the temple is here.

## Matthew 12:7

If you had understood what this means: ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice,’ you would not have condemned the innocent.

## Matthew 12:8

For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”

## Matthew 12:9

Departing from there, He entered their synagogue.

## Matthew 12:10

Inside was a man with a withered hand. They asked Jesus, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?” so they might accuse Him.

## Matthew 12:11

He asked them, “If any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, wouldn't you take hold of it and lift it out?

## Matthew 12:12

How much more valuable is a person than a sheep! Therefore, doing good on the Sabbath is lawful.”

## Matthew 12:13

Then He said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out, and it was restored, just as sound as the other.

## Matthew 12:14

But the Pharisees went out and conspired against Him, considering how they might destroy Him.

---

## Matthew 12:15

Aware of this, Jesus withdrew from there. Many followed Him, and He healed them all,

## Matthew 12:16

and He warned them not to reveal who He was.

## Matthew 12:17

This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:

## Matthew 12:18

> “Behold, My Servant whom I have chosen,
> My Beloved in whom My soul delights;
> I will put My Spirit upon Him,
> and He will proclaim justice to the nations.

## Matthew 12:19

> He will not quarrel nor cry out;
> no one will hear His voice in the streets.

## Matthew 12:20

> A bruised reed He will not break,
> and a smouldering wick He will not snuff out,
> until He leads justice to victory.

## Matthew 12:21

> In His name, the nations will place their hope.”

## Matthew 12:22

Then a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute was brought to Jesus, and He healed him, so that the man could both speak and see.

## Matthew 12:23

All the people were amazed and said, “Could this be the Son of David?”

## Matthew 12:24

But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, “This man drives out demons only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons.”

## Matthew 12:25

Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.

## Matthew 12:26

If Satan is casting out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then can his kingdom stand?

## Matthew 12:27

And if I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons drive them out? Therefore, they will be your judges.

## Matthew 12:28

But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.

## Matthew 12:29

Or how can anyone enter a strong man’s house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can plunder his house.

## Matthew 12:30

Whoever is not with Me is against Me, and whoever does not gather with Me scatters.

---

## Matthew 12:31

Therefore I tell you, every kind of sin and blasphemy can be forgiven, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.

## Matthew 12:32

Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.

---

## Matthew 12:33

Cultivate a tree to be good, and its fruit will be good; or let a tree be bad, and its fruit will be bad, for a tree is recognised by its fruit.

## Matthew 12:34

You brood of vipers, how can you who are evil say anything good? For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of.

## Matthew 12:35

A good person brings good things out of the good stored up in him, and an evil person brings evil things out of the evil stored up in him.

## Matthew 12:36

But I tell you that everyone will have to give account on the day of judgement for every careless word they have spoken.

## Matthew 12:37

For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.”

---

## Matthew 12:38

Then some of the scribes and Pharisees approached Him, saying, “Teacher, we want to see a sign from You.”

## Matthew 12:39

He replied, “A wicked and adulterous generation asks for a sign! But none will be given except the sign of the prophet Jonah.

## Matthew 12:40

For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.

## Matthew 12:41

The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgement with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now something greater than Jonah is here.

## Matthew 12:42

The Queen of the South will rise at the judgement with this generation and condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to Solomon’s wisdom, and now something greater than Solomon is here.

## Matthew 12:43

When an unclean spirit comes out of a person, it passes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it.

## Matthew 12:44

Then it says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came.’ When it arrives, it finds the house unoccupied, swept clean, and put in order.

## Matthew 12:45

Then it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that person is worse than the first. That is how it will be with this wicked generation.”

## Matthew 12:46

While He was still speaking to the crowd, His mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to Him.

## Matthew 12:47

Someone informed Him, “Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to You.”

## Matthew 12:48

He replied to the one who told Him, “Who is My mother, and who are My brothers?”

## Matthew 12:49

Gesturing towards His disciples, He said, “Here are My mother and My brothers.

## Matthew 12:50

For whoever does the will of My Father in heaven is My brother and sister and mother.”
