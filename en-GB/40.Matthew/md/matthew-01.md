# Matthew Chapter 1

## Matthew 1:1

This is the account of the genealogy of Jesus the Messiah, the son of David, the son of Abraham:

## Matthew 1:2

Abraham begat Isaac, Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob begat Judah and his brothers,

## Matthew 1:3

Judah begat Perez and Zerah, whose mother was Tamar; Perez begat Hezron, and Hezron begat Ram,

## Matthew 1:4

Ram begat Amminadab, Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,

## Matthew 1:5

Salmon begat Boaz, whose mother was Rahab; Boaz begat Obed, whose mother was Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse,

## Matthew 1:6

and Jesse begat King David. David begat Solomon, whose mother had been the wife of Uriah,

## Matthew 1:7

Solomon begat Rehoboam, Rehoboam begat Abijah, and Abijah begat Asa,

## Matthew 1:8

Asa begat Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat begat Joram, and Joram begat Uzziah,

## Matthew 1:9

Uzziah begat Jotham, Jotham begat Ahaz, and Ahaz begat Hezekiah,

## Matthew 1:10

Hezekiah begat Manasseh, Manasseh begat Amon, and Amon begat Josiah,

## Matthew 1:11

and Josiah begat Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon.

## Matthew 1:12

After the exile to Babylon: Jeconiah begat Shealtiel, and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel,

## Matthew 1:13

Zerubbabel begat Abihud, Abihud begat Eliakim, and Eliakim begat Azor,

## Matthew 1:14

Azor begat Zadok, Zadok begat Achim, and Achim begat Eliud,

## Matthew 1:15

Eliud begat Eleazar, Eleazar begat Matthan, and Matthan begat Jacob,

## Matthew 1:16

and Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called the Messiah.

## Matthew 1:17

So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations; from David to the exile to Babylon, fourteen generations; and from the exile to the Messiah, fourteen generations.

## Matthew 1:18

Now the birth of Jesus the Messiah occurred in this manner: When His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit.

## Matthew 1:19

Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man and not wishing to disgrace her, resolved to divorce her quietly.

## Matthew 1:20

But as he considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.

## Matthew 1:21

She will bear a son, and you shall name Him Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.”

## Matthew 1:22

All this happened to fulfil what the Lord had spoken through the prophet:

## Matthew 1:23

“Behold, the young virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel,” which means “God with us.”

## Matthew 1:24

When Joseph awoke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took Mary as his wife,

## Matthew 1:25

but did not consummate their marriage until she bore a son; and he named Him Jesus.
