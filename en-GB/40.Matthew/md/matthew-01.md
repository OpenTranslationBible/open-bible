## Matthew 1:18

Now the birth of Jesus the Messiah was as follows:  
When His mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph,  
before they came together she was found to be pregnant by the Holy Spirit.

## Matthew 1:19

And her husband Joseph, being a righteous man and not wanting to disgrace her,  
planned to send her away secretly.

## Matthew 1:20

But when he had thought this over, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying,  
“Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife;  
for the Child who has been conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.

## Matthew 1:21

She will give birth to a Son;  
and you shall name Him Jesus,  
for He will save His people from their sins.”

## Matthew 1:22

Now all this took place so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet would be fulfilled:

## Matthew 1:23

“Behold, the virgin will conceive and give birth to a Son,  
And they shall name Him Immanuel,”  
which translated means, “God with us.”

## Matthew 1:24

And Joseph awoke from his sleep and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him,  
and took Mary as his wife,

## Matthew 1:25

but kept her a virgin until she gave birth to a Son;  
and he named Him Jesus.
