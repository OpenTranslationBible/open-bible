# Matthew Chapter 10

## Matthew 10:1

Jesus called together his twelve disciples and granted them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and sickness.

## Matthew 10:2

These are the twelve apostles: first, Simon, known as Peter, and his brother Andrew; James, son of Zebedee, and his brother John;

## Matthew 10:3

Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew, who was a tax collector; James, son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;

## Matthew 10:4

Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who later betrayed him.

---

## Matthew 10:5

These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: “Do not go on a road to the Gentiles, and do not enter a city of the Samaritans;

## Matthew 10:6

but instead, go to the lost sheep of Israel.

## Matthew 10:7

As you go, proclaim this message: ‘The kingdom of heaven is near.’

## Matthew 10:8

Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those with leprosy, cast out demons. Freely you have received, freely give.

## Matthew 10:9

Do not acquire gold, silver, or copper for your money belts—

## Matthew 10:10

nor a bag for the journey, nor an extra tunic, nor sandals, nor a staff; for the worker is worthy of his sustenance.

---

## Matthew 10:11

Whatever town or village you enter, search for someone worthy and stay at their house until you leave.

## Matthew 10:12

As you enter the house, offer your greeting.

## Matthew 10:13

If the house is deserving, let your peace rest upon it; if it is not, let your peace return to you.

## Matthew 10:14

If anyone does not welcome you or listen to your words, leave that house or town and shake the dust off your feet.

## Matthew 10:15

Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgement than for that town.

---

## Matthew 10:16

“Behold, I am sending you out like sheep among wolves; therefore be as shrewd as serpents and as innocent as doves.

## Matthew 10:17

Be on your guard against people; they will hand you over to the local councils and flog you in their synagogues.

## Matthew 10:18

You will be brought before governors and kings because of me, as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.

## Matthew 10:19

But when they arrest you, do not worry about how or what you should say; for what you should say will be given to you at that time.

## Matthew 10:20

For it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father will speak through you.

---

## Matthew 10:21

“Brother will turn against brother to death, and a father against his child; children will rise up against parents and have them put to death.

## Matthew 10:22

You will be hated by everyone because of my name, but the one who stands firm to the end will be saved.

## Matthew 10:23

When you face persecution in one place, move to another. Truly I tell you, you will not finish going through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.

---

## Matthew 10:24

“A disciple is not above the teacher, nor a servant above his master.

## Matthew 10:25

It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If they have called the head of the house Beelzebul, how much more will they malign the members of his household!

---

## Matthew 10:26

“So do not be afraid of them, for there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known.

## Matthew 10:27

What I tell you in the dark, speak in the light; what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the rooftops.

## Matthew 10:28

Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, fear Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.

## Matthew 10:29

Are not two sparrows sold for a small coin? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father.

## Matthew 10:30

And even the very hairs of your head are all counted.

## Matthew 10:31

So do not be afraid; you are more valuable than many sparrows.

---

## Matthew 10:32

“Whoever acknowledges me before others, I will acknowledge before my Father in heaven.

## Matthew 10:33

But whoever denies me before others, I will deny before my Father in heaven.

---

## Matthew 10:34

“Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.

## Matthew 10:35

For I have come to

> set a son against his father,
> a daughter against her mother,
> and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;

## Matthew 10:36

> and a person's enemies will be the members of his own household.

---

## Matthew 10:37

“If anyone loves their father or mother more than me, they are not deserving of me; if anyone loves their son or daughter more than me, they are not deserving of me.

## Matthew 10:38

Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not fit for me.

## Matthew 10:39

Whoever seeks to preserve their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it.

---

## Matthew 10:40

“Anyone who receives you receives me, and anyone who receives me receives the one who sent me.

## Matthew 10:41

Whoever receives a prophet because they are a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward, and whoever receives a righteous person because they are righteous will receive a righteous person’s reward.

## Matthew 10:42

And if anyone offers even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones who is my disciple, truly I tell you, that person will certainly not miss their reward.”
