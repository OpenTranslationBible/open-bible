# Matthew Chapter 25

## Matthew 25:1

“At that time, the kingdom of heaven will be likened to ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.

## Matthew 25:2

Five of them acted unwisely, and five acted wisely.

## Matthew 25:3

The foolish ones took their lamps but did not bring any additional oil with them.

## Matthew 25:4

The wise ones, however, took oil in flasks along with their lamps.

## Matthew 25:5

The bridegroom was delayed, and they all became drowsy and fell asleep.

## Matthew 25:6

At midnight there was a shout: ‘Here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!’

## Matthew 25:7

Then all the virgins rose and prepared their lamps.

## Matthew 25:8

The foolish ones said to the wise, ‘Share some of your oil with us, for our lamps are going out.’

## Matthew 25:9

But the wise replied, ‘No, there might not be enough for both us and you. Instead, go to the merchants and buy some for yourselves.’

## Matthew 25:10

While they were on their way to buy the oil, the bridegroom arrived. Those who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet, and the door was shut.

## Matthew 25:11

Later, the other virgins also came, saying, ‘Lord, Lord, open the door for us.’

## Matthew 25:12

But he replied, ‘Truly, I tell you, I do not recognise you.’

## Matthew 25:13

Therefore, stay alert, because you do not know the day or the hour.

## Matthew 25:14

“For it is like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his wealth to them.

## Matthew 25:15

To one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey.

## Matthew 25:16

The one who had received five talents went at once and traded with them, and gained five more.

## Matthew 25:17

In the same way, the one with two talents gained two more.

## Matthew 25:18

But the one who had received one talent went off, dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master’s money.

## Matthew 25:19

After a significant period, the master of those servants came back and settled accounts with them.

## Matthew 25:20

The one who had received five talents came forward, bringing five more, saying, ‘Master, you entrusted me with five talents. See, I have gained five more.’

## Matthew 25:21

His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Enter into the joy of your master.’

## Matthew 25:22

The one with two talents also came forward and said, ‘Master, you entrusted me with two talents; see, I have gained two more.’

## Matthew 25:23

His master replied, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Enter into the joy of your master.’

## Matthew 25:24

Then the one who had received one talent also came forward and said, ‘Master, I knew that you are a hard man, reaping where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed.

## Matthew 25:25

So I was afraid and went out and hid your talent in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.’

## Matthew 25:26

His master replied, ‘You wicked, lazy servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed?

## Matthew 25:27

Then you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned, I would have received it back with interest.

## Matthew 25:28

Therefore, take the talent from him and give it to the one who has ten talents.

## Matthew 25:29

For whoever possesses will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not possess, even what they have will be taken from them.

## Matthew 25:30

And cast that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’

## Matthew 25:31

When the Son of Man arrives in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his majestic throne.

## Matthew 25:32

All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd divides the sheep from the goats.

## Matthew 25:33

He will place the sheep on his right side and the goats on his left.

## Matthew 25:34

Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father; inherit the kingdom prepared for you since the foundation of the world.

## Matthew 25:35

For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me,

## Matthew 25:36

I needed clothes and you provided for me, I was sick and you cared for me, I was in prison and you visited me.’

## Matthew 25:37

Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink?

## Matthew 25:38

When did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or lacking clothes and provide for you?

## Matthew 25:39

When did we see you unwell or in prison and visit you?’

## Matthew 25:40

The King will reply, ‘Truly I say to you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.’

## Matthew 25:41

Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you who are accursed, and enter the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels.

## Matthew 25:42

For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink,

## Matthew 25:43

I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, I needed clothes and you did not provide for me, I was sick and in prison and you did not care for me.’

## Matthew 25:44

They also will answer, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or lacking clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?’

## Matthew 25:45

He will reply, ‘Truly I say to you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.’

## Matthew 25:46

Then they will go away to everlasting punishment, but the righteous to everlasting life.”
