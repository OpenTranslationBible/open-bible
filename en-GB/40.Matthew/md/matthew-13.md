# Matthew Chapter 13

## Matthew 13:1

On that same day, Jesus left the house and sat by the sea.

## Matthew 13:2

Large crowds gathered around him, so he got into a boat and sat down, while the crowd stood on the shore.

## Matthew 13:3

He spoke many things to them in parables, saying: “Consider the sower who went out to sow.

## Matthew 13:4

As he sowed, some seeds fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them.

## Matthew 13:5

Some fell on rocky places, where there was not much soil. They sprang up quickly because the soil was shallow.

## Matthew 13:6

But when the sun rose, they were scorched, and since they had no root, they withered away.

## Matthew 13:7

Other seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them.

## Matthew 13:8

But others fell on good soil and yielded a crop, some a hundred, some sixty, and some thirty times what was sown.

## Matthew 13:9

He who has ears, let him hear.”

## Matthew 13:10

The disciples approached him and inquired, “Why do you use parables when speaking to the people?”

## Matthew 13:11

He answered, “To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given.

## Matthew 13:12

For whoever has, more will be given, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken away.

## Matthew 13:13

This is why I speak to them in parables: because

> seeing they do not see,
> and hearing they do not hear,
> nor do they understand.

## Matthew 13:14

In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah:

> ‘You will keep on hearing, but never understand;
> you will keep on seeing, but never perceive.

## Matthew 13:15

> For this people’s heart has grown dull;
> with their ears they scarcely hear,
> and they have closed their eyes.
> Otherwise they might see with their eyes,
> hear with their ears,
> understand with their hearts and turn,
> and I would heal them.’

## Matthew 13:16

But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.

## Matthew 13:17

For I assure you, many prophets and righteous people desired to see what you see and did not see it, and to hear what you hear and did not hear it.

## Matthew 13:18

“Now hear the explanation of the parable of the sower.

## Matthew 13:19

When anyone hears the message of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in their heart. This is the seed sown along the path.

## Matthew 13:20

The seed sown on rocky ground is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy.

## Matthew 13:21

Yet they have no root in themselves, but endure only for a while. When trouble or persecution arises on account of the word, they quickly fall away.

## Matthew 13:22

The seed sown among thorns is the one who hears the word, but the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, making it unfruitful.

## Matthew 13:23

But the seed sown on good soil is the one who hears the word and understands it. They indeed bear fruit and produce, some a hundred, some sixty, some thirty times what was sown.”

## Matthew 13:24

He presented another parable to them, saying, “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.

## Matthew 13:25

But while everyone was asleep, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away.

## Matthew 13:26

When the wheat sprouted and formed grain, then the weeds also appeared.

## Matthew 13:27

The servants of the landowner came and said to him, ‘Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have weeds?’

## Matthew 13:28

He said to them, ‘An enemy has done this!’ The servants asked him, ‘Do you want us to go and gather them up?’

## Matthew 13:29

But he said, ‘No, lest while you gather up the weeds, you also uproot the wheat with them.

## Matthew 13:30

Let both grow together until the harvest. At the time of harvest, I will say to the reapers, “First gather the weeds and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn.”’”

---

## Matthew 13:31

He shared with them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field.

## Matthew 13:32

Though it is the smallest of all seeds, when it grows, it is larger than the garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches.”

---

## Matthew 13:33

He told them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour until it was all leavened.”

---

## Matthew 13:34

Jesus spoke all these things to the crowds in parables; he did not speak to them without using a parable.

## Matthew 13:35

This was to fulfil what was spoken through the prophet: “I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden since the foundation of the world.”

---

## Matthew 13:36

Then he left the crowds and went into the house. His disciples came to him and said, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.”

## Matthew 13:37

He answered, “The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man,

## Matthew 13:38

and the field is the world; the good seed stands for the children of the kingdom, and the weeds are the children of the evil one.

## Matthew 13:39

The enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels.

## Matthew 13:40

As the weeds are gathered and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the age.

## Matthew 13:41

The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all that causes sin and all who do evil.

## Matthew 13:42

They will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

## Matthew 13:43

Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.

## Matthew 13:44

“The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid again; and in his joy, he went and sold all he had and bought that field.

## Matthew 13:45

“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking fine pearls.

## Matthew 13:46

When he found one pearl of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought it.

## Matthew 13:47

“Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea and gathered fish of every kind.

## Matthew 13:48

When it was full, they pulled it up on the shore, and sat down and collected the good fish into baskets, but threw the bad away.

## Matthew 13:49

This is what will occur at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous

## Matthew 13:50

and throw them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

---

## Matthew 13:51

“Have you understood all these things?” Jesus asked. They said to him, “Yes.”

## Matthew 13:52

And he said to them, “Therefore every scribe who has become a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old.”

---

## Matthew 13:53

After Jesus had finished these parables, he moved on from there.

## Matthew 13:54

Coming to his hometown, he began teaching the people in their synagogue, and they were astonished, saying, “Where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers?”

## Matthew 13:55

“Is this not the carpenter’s son? Is not his mother called Mary, and his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?

## Matthew 13:56

And are not all his sisters among us? So where did this man acquire all these things?”

## Matthew 13:57

And they took offence at him. But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honour except in his hometown and in his own household.”

## Matthew 13:58

And he did not perform many miracles there due to their lack of faith.
