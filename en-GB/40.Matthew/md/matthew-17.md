# Matthew Chapter 17

## Matthew 17:1

After six days, Jesus took Peter, James, and John the brother of James, and led them up a high mountain by themselves.

## Matthew 17:2

He was transfigured before them; His face shone like the sun, and His clothes became as white as light.

## Matthew 17:3

Suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, conversing with Jesus.

## Matthew 17:4

Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will set up three shelters: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”

## Matthew 17:5

While he was still speaking, a bright cloud enveloped them, and a voice from the cloud said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to Him!”

## Matthew 17:6

Upon hearing this, the disciples were so afraid that they fell to the ground.

## Matthew 17:7

Then Jesus approached them, touched them, and said, “Rise, and do not be afraid.”

## Matthew 17:8

When they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus Himself.

## Matthew 17:9

As they were descending the mountain, Jesus instructed them, “Do not tell anyone about the vision until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.”

## Matthew 17:10

The disciples asked Him, “Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”

## Matthew 17:11

Jesus replied, “Indeed, Elijah is coming and will restore all things.

## Matthew 17:12

But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognise him, but did to him whatever they wished. In the same way, the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands.”

## Matthew 17:13

Then the disciples realised He was speaking to them about John the Baptist.

## Matthew 17:14

When they reached the crowd, a man approached Jesus, kneeling before Him.

## Matthew 17:15

“Lord, have mercy on my son,” he said. “He has seizures and suffers terribly; he often falls into the fire or into the water.

## Matthew 17:16

I brought him to your disciples, but they were unable to heal him.”

## Matthew 17:17

Jesus answered, “You unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I stay with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring the boy here to Me.”

## Matthew 17:18

Jesus commanded the demon to leave, and it departed from the boy, who was healed instantly.

## Matthew 17:19

Later, the disciples approached Jesus in private and asked, “Why were we unable to drive it out?”

## Matthew 17:20

He said to them, “Because of your little faith. Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move; nothing will be impossible for you.”

## Matthew 17:21

[This kind can only be driven out by prayer and fasting.]

## Matthew 17:22

While they were gathering in Galilee, Jesus said to them, “The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men;

## Matthew 17:23

They will put Him to death, and on the third day He will rise again.” And the disciples were deeply saddened.

## Matthew 17:24

When they arrived in Capernaum, the collectors of the two-drachma temple tax came to Peter and asked, “Does your teacher not pay the temple tax?”

## Matthew 17:25

“Yes, He does,” Peter replied. When he entered the house, Jesus spoke first, “What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth collect duties and taxes—from their own children or from others?”

## Matthew 17:26

Peter answered, “From others.” Jesus said to him, “Then the children are exempt.

## Matthew 17:27

But so that we may not cause offence, go to the sea and cast a line. Take the first fish you catch; open its mouth and you will find a four-drachma coin. Take it and give it to them for my tax and yours.”
