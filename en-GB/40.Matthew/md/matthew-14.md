# Matthew Chapter 14

## Matthew 14:1

During that period, Herod the tetrarch became aware of the news concerning Jesus,

## Matthew 14:2

and he said to his servants, “This is John the Baptist; he has been raised from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him.”

---

## Matthew 14:3

For Herod had taken John into custody, bound him, and placed him in prison due to Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip.

## Matthew 14:4

For John had been telling him, “It is against the law for you to have her.”

## Matthew 14:5

Herod wanted to put John to death, but he feared the people, because they regarded John as a prophet.

---

## Matthew 14:6

But when Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before the guests and pleased Herod so much

## Matthew 14:7

that he vowed to give her whatever she requested.

## Matthew 14:8

Encouraged by her mother, she said, “Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.”

## Matthew 14:9

The king was distressed, but because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he commanded it to be given.

## Matthew 14:10

He sent orders and had John beheaded in the prison.

## Matthew 14:11

John's head was presented on a platter and given to the girl, who then took it to her mother.

## Matthew 14:12

John’s disciples came, took away the body, and buried it; then they went and told Jesus.

---

## Matthew 14:13

When Jesus heard about John, He withdrew by boat to a secluded place by Himself. But when the crowds heard of this, they followed Him on foot from the towns.

## Matthew 14:14

When He came ashore, He saw a large crowd, felt compassion for them, and healed their sick.

---

## Matthew 14:15

As evening approached, the disciples came to Him and said, “This is a remote place, and it’s already late. Send the crowds away, so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food.”

## Matthew 14:16

But Jesus said to them, “They do not need to go away; you give them something to eat.”

## Matthew 14:17

They responded, “We have here only five loaves and two fish.”

## Matthew 14:18

And He said, “Bring them here to Me.”

## Matthew 14:19

He directed the people to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish, He looked up to heaven, gave thanks, and broke the loaves. Then He gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.

## Matthew 14:20

They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve baskets full of broken pieces that were left over.

## Matthew 14:21

Those who ate were about five thousand men, in addition to women and children.

---

## Matthew 14:22

Immediately Jesus instructed the disciples to get into the boat and go on ahead of Him to the other side, while He dismissed the crowd.

## Matthew 14:23

After He had dismissed them, He went up on the mountainside by Himself to pray. When evening came, He was there alone,

## Matthew 14:24

but the boat was already a considerable distance from land, battered by the waves because the wind was against it.

## Matthew 14:25

In the fourth watch of the night, Jesus went out to them, walking on the sea.

## Matthew 14:26

When the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were terrified, and said, “It is a ghost!” and cried out in fear.

## Matthew 14:27

But Jesus immediately reassured them, saying, “Take courage! It is I; do not be afraid.”

## Matthew 14:28

Peter replied to Him, “Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water.”

## Matthew 14:29

And He said, “Come.” Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water, and came toward Jesus.

## Matthew 14:30

But when he noticed the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, “Lord, save me!”

## Matthew 14:31

Jesus immediately reached out His hand and caught him. “You of little faith,” He said, “why did you doubt?”

## Matthew 14:32

When they climbed into the boat, the wind ceased.

## Matthew 14:33

Then those who were in the boat honoured Him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God.”

---

## Matthew 14:34

Once they had crossed over, they arrived at Gennesaret.

## Matthew 14:35

And when the men of that place recognised Him, they sent word to all the surrounding region and brought to Him all who were sick;

## Matthew 14:36

and they begged Him to let the sick just touch the edge of His cloak, and all who touched it were healed.
