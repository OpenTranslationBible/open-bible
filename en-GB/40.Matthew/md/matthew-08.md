# Matthew Chapter 8

## Matthew 8:1

When Jesus descended from the mountain, large crowds followed Him.

## Matthew 8:2

A man afflicted with leprosy approached Him, bowed before Him, and said, “Lord, if You are willing, You can cleanse me.”

## Matthew 8:3

Jesus extended His hand and touched him, saying, “I am willing; be clean.” Instantly, his leprosy was cleansed.

## Matthew 8:4

Jesus instructed him, “See that you tell no one; but go, show yourself to the priest and present the offering that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.”

## Matthew 8:5

Upon entering Capernaum, a centurion approached Him, seeking assistance.

## Matthew 8:6

“Lord,” he said, “my servant lies paralysed at home, suffering terribly.”

## Matthew 8:7

Jesus said to him, “I will come and heal him.”

## Matthew 8:8

The centurion answered, “Lord, I am not worthy for You to enter under my roof, but only say the word, and my servant will be healed.

## Matthew 8:9

For I too am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I say to one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”

## Matthew 8:10

When Jesus heard this, He was amazed and said to those following Him, “Truly I tell you, I have not found such great faith in anyone in Israel.

## Matthew 8:11

I say to you that many will come from the east and west and will recline at the table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven;

## Matthew 8:12

but those who were originally intended for the kingdom will be cast into the outer darkness; in that place, there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”

## Matthew 8:13

Then Jesus said to the centurion, “Go; it shall be done for you as you have believed.” And the servant was healed at that very moment.

## Matthew 8:14

When Jesus arrived at Peter’s house, He saw Peter’s mother-in-law lying in bed with a fever.

## Matthew 8:15

He touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she arose and began to serve Him.

## Matthew 8:16

As evening approached, they brought to Him many who were troubled by demons, and He cast out the spirits with a word and healed all who were ill.

## Matthew 8:17

This was to fulfil what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:

> “He took up our infirmities
> and bore our diseases.”

## Matthew 8:18

When Jesus saw the crowd around Him, He gave orders to cross to the other side of the sea.

## Matthew 8:19

Then a scribe approached Him and said, “Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go.”

## Matthew 8:20

Jesus replied, “Foxes have dens and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.”

## Matthew 8:21

Another disciple said to Him, “Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.”

## Matthew 8:22

But Jesus said to him, “Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead.”

## Matthew 8:23

As He entered the boat, His disciples accompanied Him.

## Matthew 8:24

Suddenly, a violent storm arose on the sea, so that the boat was being covered by the waves; but Jesus was asleep.

## Matthew 8:25

The disciples came to Him and woke Him, saying, “Save us, Lord; we are perishing!”

## Matthew 8:26

He said to them, “Why are you afraid, you of little faith?” Then He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and it became perfectly calm.

## Matthew 8:27

The men were amazed and said, “What kind of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?”

## Matthew 8:28

When He arrived at the other side in the region of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men confronted Him as they came out of the tombs. They were so violent that no one could pass that way.

## Matthew 8:29

They cried out, “What do You want with us, Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the appointed time?”

## Matthew 8:30

Not far from them, a large herd of pigs was feeding.

## Matthew 8:31

The demons begged Him, “If You cast us out, send us into the herd of pigs.”

## Matthew 8:32

He said to them, “Go!” So they came out and went into the pigs, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and perished in the waters.

## Matthew 8:33

The herdsmen fled, went into the city and reported everything, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men.

## Matthew 8:34

Then the whole city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw Him, they pleaded with Him to leave their region.
