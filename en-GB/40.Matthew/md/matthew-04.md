## Matthew 4:1

Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.

## Matthew 4:2

After fasting for forty days and forty nights, he became hungry.

## Matthew 4:3

The tempter approached him and said, “If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become bread.”

## Matthew 4:4

But Jesus replied, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.’”

## Matthew 4:5

Then the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the pinnacle of the temple.

## Matthew 4:6

He said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down; for it is written: ‘He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.’”

## Matthew 4:7

Jesus responded, “It is also written: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’”

## Matthew 4:8

Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendour.

## Matthew 4:9

He said to him, “I will give you all these things if you will fall down and worship me.”

## Matthew 4:10

Then Jesus said to him, “Go away, Satan! For it is written: ‘Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.’”

## Matthew 4:11

Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and ministered to him.

## Matthew 4:12

When Jesus heard that John had been taken into custody, he withdrew to Galilee.

## Matthew 4:13

Leaving Nazareth, he went and settled in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali—

## Matthew 4:14

to fulfil what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:

## Matthew 4:15

“The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles—

## Matthew 4:16

the people dwelling in darkness have seen a great light; on those dwelling in the land of the shadow of death, a light has dawned.”

## Matthew 4:17

From that time, Jesus began to preach, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.”

## Matthew 4:18

As Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter, and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.

## Matthew 4:19

And he said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of people.”

## Matthew 4:20

Immediately, they left their nets and followed him.

## Matthew 4:21

Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and his brother John, in the boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets; and he called them.

## Matthew 4:22

Immediately, they left the boat and their father, and followed him.

## Matthew 4:23

Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people.

## Matthew 4:24

News about him spread throughout Syria, and they brought to him all who were ill, those suffering from various diseases and severe pain, the demon-possessed, those with epilepsy, and the paralysed; and he healed them.

## Matthew 4:25

Large crowds followed him from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and from beyond the Jordan.
