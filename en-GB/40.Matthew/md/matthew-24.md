# Matthew Chapter 24

## Matthew 24:1

Jesus departed from the temple and was on His way when His disciples approached to point out the temple buildings to Him.

## Matthew 24:2

He replied to them, “Do you see all these things? Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left upon another; every one will be thrown down.”

---

## Matthew 24:3

As He sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, asking, “Tell us, when will these things happen, and what will be the sign of Your coming and of the end of the age?”

## Matthew 24:4

Jesus answered them, “Be careful that no one deceives you.

## Matthew 24:5

For many will come in My name, asserting, ‘I am the Messiah,’ and will deceive many.

## Matthew 24:6

You will hear of wars and rumours of wars; see that you are not alarmed. Such things must occur, but the end is not yet.

## Matthew 24:7

Nations will rise against each other, and kingdoms will clash. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places.

## Matthew 24:8

All these are merely the beginning of birth pains.

---

## Matthew 24:9

“Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and killed, and you will be hated by all nations because of My name.

## Matthew 24:10

At that time many will fall away from the faith and will betray and hate one another,

## Matthew 24:11

and many false prophets will arise and deceive many.

## Matthew 24:12

Because of the increase of lawlessness, the love of most will grow cold,

## Matthew 24:13

but whoever endures to the end will find salvation.

## Matthew 24:14

And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.

---

## Matthew 24:15

“So when you see the abomination of desolation, spoken of through the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place—let the reader understand—

## Matthew 24:16

at that time those who are in Judea should escape to the mountains.

## Matthew 24:17

Those on the housetop should not go down to take anything out of the house.

## Matthew 24:18

Those in the field should not go back to get their cloak.

## Matthew 24:19

It will be distressing in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers!

## Matthew 24:20

Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on a Sabbath.

## Matthew 24:21

For then there will be great tribulation, unequalled from the beginning of the world until now—and never to be equalled again.

## Matthew 24:22

If those days had not been shortened, no one would survive, but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened.

---

## Matthew 24:23

At that moment, if anyone claims, ‘Look, here is the Messiah!’ or, ‘There He is!’ do not believe it.

## Matthew 24:24

For impostors claiming to be the Messiah and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.

## Matthew 24:25

Remember, I have told you beforehand.

## Matthew 24:26

Therefore, if anyone tells you, ‘He is in the wilderness,’ do not go out; or, ‘He is in the inner rooms,’ do not believe it.

## Matthew 24:27

For just as lightning comes from the east and is visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.

## Matthew 24:28

Wherever there is a corpse, there the vultures will gather.

---

## Matthew 24:29

“Immediately after the tribulation of those days

> ‘the sun will be darkened,
> and the moon will not give its light;
> the stars will fall from the sky,
> and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.’

## Matthew 24:30

Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven. Then all the peoples of the earth will mourn when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.

## Matthew 24:31

And He will send His angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather His chosen ones from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other.

---

## Matthew 24:32

“Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its branch becomes tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.

## Matthew 24:33

In the same way, when you see all these things, you know that it is near, right at the door.

## Matthew 24:34

Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have occurred.

## Matthew 24:35

Heaven and earth will pass away, yet My words will never pass away.

---

## Matthew 24:36

“But concerning that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.

## Matthew 24:37

Just as it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.

## Matthew 24:38

For in the days leading up to the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day Noah entered the ark;

## Matthew 24:39

and they were unaware of what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.

## Matthew 24:40

Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left behind.

## Matthew 24:41

Two women will be grinding with a hand mill; one will be taken and the other left behind.

---

## Matthew 24:42

“Therefore remain vigilant, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come.

## Matthew 24:43

But understand this: If the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch and not allowed his house to be broken into.

## Matthew 24:44

So you also must be prepared, because the Son of Man will arrive at an hour when you do not expect Him.

---

## Matthew 24:45

“Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom the master has put in charge of the servants in his household to provide them their food at the proper time?

## Matthew 24:46

Blessed is that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns.

## Matthew 24:47

Truly I tell you, he will appoint him over all his possessions.

## Matthew 24:48

But suppose that servant is wicked and says to himself, ‘My master is delayed,’

## Matthew 24:49

and he then begins to mistreat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with drunkards.

## Matthew 24:50

The master of that servant will arrive on a day when he is not expected and at an hour of which he is unaware.

## Matthew 24:51

He will punish him severely and assign him a place with the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
