# Matthew Chapter 27

## Matthew 27:1

When morning arrived, all the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered to plan against Jesus to have Him put to death.

## Matthew 27:2

They tied Him with bonds, took Him away, and delivered Him to Pilate, the governor.

---

## Matthew 27:3

Judas, who had betrayed Him, saw that Jesus was condemned and was filled with remorse. He returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.

## Matthew 27:4

He said, “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.” They replied, “What is that to us? That is your responsibility.”

## Matthew 27:5

Judas threw the silver into the temple and left. He then went away and hanged himself.

## Matthew 27:6

The chief priests collected the silver and said, “It is not lawful to put it into the treasury, as it is blood money.”

## Matthew 27:7

They decided to use the money to buy the potter’s field as a burial place for foreigners.

## Matthew 27:8

Therefore, that field has been known as the Field of Blood to this day.

## Matthew 27:9

Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: “They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price set on Him by the sons of Israel,

## Matthew 27:10

and they used them to buy the potter’s field, as the Lord directed me.”

---

## Matthew 27:11

Jesus stood before the governor, who asked Him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” Jesus replied, “You say so.”

## Matthew 27:12

When accused by the chief priests and elders, He gave no answer.

## Matthew 27:13

Then Pilate said to Him, “Do you not hear the many charges they bring against you?”

## Matthew 27:14

But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge, greatly astonishing the governor.

---

## Matthew 27:15

At the festival, it was the governor’s custom to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd.

## Matthew 27:16

At that time, they had a notorious prisoner named Barabbas.

## Matthew 27:17

When the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, “Whom do you want me to release to you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Messiah?”

## Matthew 27:18

He knew it was out of envy that they had handed Jesus over to him.

## Matthew 27:19

While Pilate was sitting on the judgement seat, his wife sent him a message: “Do not have anything to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered greatly today in a dream because of Him.”

## Matthew 27:20

However, the chief priests and the elders convinced the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to demand Jesus' execution.

## Matthew 27:21

The governor asked, “Which of the two do you want me to release to you?” They replied, “Barabbas.”

## Matthew 27:22

Pilate asked, “What shall I do then with Jesus who is called the Messiah?” They all answered, “Crucify Him!”

## Matthew 27:23

“Why, what crime has He committed?” asked Pilate. But they shouted even louder, “Crucify Him!”

## Matthew 27:24

When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that a riot was beginning, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, “I am innocent of this man’s blood. It is your responsibility!”

## Matthew 27:25

All the people answered, “Let His blood be on us and on our children!”

## Matthew 27:26

Then he released Barabbas to them. He had Jesus scourged and handed Him over to be crucified.

---

## Matthew 27:27

The governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers around Him.

## Matthew 27:28

They stripped His garments and placed a scarlet robe upon Him.

## Matthew 27:29

They twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on His head. They put a staff in His right hand and knelt in front of Him, mocking Him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!”

## Matthew 27:30

They spat on Him and took the staff, striking Him on the head repeatedly.

## Matthew 27:31

After mocking Him, they took off the robe and put His own clothes on Him. Then they led Him away to be crucified.

---

## Matthew 27:32

As they were going out, they found a man from Cyrene named Simon, whom they forced to carry the cross.

## Matthew 27:33

They arrived at a place called Golgotha, which is translated as "The Place of the Skull."

## Matthew 27:34

There they offered Jesus wine mixed with gall to drink; but after tasting it, He refused to drink it.

## Matthew 27:35

After they had crucified Him, they divided His clothes by casting lots.

## Matthew 27:36

And sitting down, they kept watch over Him.

## Matthew 27:37

Above Him, they placed the written accusation: THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.

---

## Matthew 27:38

Two criminals were crucified with Him, one on His right and one on His left.

## Matthew 27:39

Those who passed by insulted Him, shaking their heads

## Matthew 27:40

and saying, “You who claim to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross!”

## Matthew 27:41

In the same way, the chief priests, along with the scribes and elders, mocked Him.

## Matthew 27:42

“He saved others,” they said, “but He cannot save Himself! He is the King of Israel; let Him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in Him.

## Matthew 27:43

He trusts in God; let God rescue Him now if He takes pleasure in Him, for He said, ‘I am the Son of God.’”

## Matthew 27:44

In the same way, the criminals who were crucified with Him also insulted Him.

---

## Matthew 27:45

From noon until three in the afternoon, darkness covered all the land.

## Matthew 27:46

Around three in the afternoon, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, “Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?” which means, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”

## Matthew 27:47

When some of those standing there heard this, they said, “He is calling Elijah.”

## Matthew 27:48

Immediately, one of them ran and got a sponge, filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a staff, and offered it to Jesus to drink.

## Matthew 27:49

The rest said, “Leave Him alone. Let us see if Elijah comes to save Him.”

## Matthew 27:50

And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, He surrendered His spirit.

---

## Matthew 27:51

At that moment, the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook, and the rocks split.

## Matthew 27:52

The tombs broke open, and the bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life.

## Matthew 27:53

They emerged from the tombs after Jesus’ resurrection and went into the holy city, appearing to many people.

## Matthew 27:54

When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified and exclaimed, “Truly, He was the Son of God!”

---

## Matthew 27:55

Many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for Him.

## Matthew 27:56

Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.

---

## Matthew 27:57

As evening approached, a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had become a disciple of Jesus, came.

## Matthew 27:58

He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus’ body, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him.

## Matthew 27:59

Joseph took possession of the body, wrapping it in a clean linen cloth,

## Matthew 27:60

and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a large stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away.

## Matthew 27:61

Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were seated there opposite the tomb.

---

## Matthew 27:62

The following day, after the Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.

## Matthew 27:63

They said, “Sir, we remember that while He was still alive, that deceiver said, ‘After three days I will rise again.’

## Matthew 27:64

So please order the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, His disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that He has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first.”

## Matthew 27:65

Pilate said to them, “Take a guard; go, make the tomb as secure as you know how.”

## Matthew 27:66

So they went and secured the tomb by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard.
