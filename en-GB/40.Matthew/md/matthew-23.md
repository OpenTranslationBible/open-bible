# Matthew Chapter 23

## Matthew 23:1

Then Jesus addressed the crowds and his disciples,

## Matthew 23:2

saying: “The scribes and the Pharisees have taken their seat in Moses’ chair.

## Matthew 23:3

Therefore, do and observe everything they tell you, but do not follow their example, for they do not practise what they preach.

## Matthew 23:4

They bundle up heavy burdens and lay them on people’s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them.

## Matthew 23:5

All their actions are done to be seen by others: they make their phylacteries broad and the tassels on their garments long;

## Matthew 23:6

they delight in the places of distinction at banquets and the best seats in the synagogues;

## Matthew 23:7

they enjoy greetings in the marketplaces and being called ‘Rabbi’ by others.

## Matthew 23:8

But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’ for you have one Teacher, and you are all siblings.

## Matthew 23:9

And do not call anyone on earth ‘father,’ for you have one Father, who is in heaven.

## Matthew 23:10

Nor are you to be called leaders, for you have one Leader, the Christ.

## Matthew 23:11

The one who is greatest among you shall be your servant.

## Matthew 23:12

For whoever exalts themselves will be humbled, and whoever humbles themselves will be exalted.

## Matthew 23:13

“But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You shut the door of the kingdom of heaven in people’s faces. You do not enter yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in.

## Matthew 23:14

[14]

## Matthew 23:15

“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to make a single convert, and when they become one, you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are.

## Matthew 23:16

“Woe to you, blind guides! You say, ‘If anyone swears by the temple, it means nothing; but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, they are bound by that oath.’

## Matthew 23:17

You blind fools! Which is more important: the gold, or the temple that sanctifies the gold?

## Matthew 23:18

And you say, ‘If anyone swears by the altar, it means nothing; but if anyone swears by the gift on the altar, they are bound by that oath.’

## Matthew 23:19

You blind men! Which is more important: the gift, or the altar that makes the gift sacred?

## Matthew 23:20

Therefore, anyone who swears by the altar is swearing by it and by everything on it.

## Matthew 23:21

And anyone who swears by the temple swears by it and by him who dwells in it.

## Matthew 23:22

And anyone who swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by him who sits upon it.

## Matthew 23:23

“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices—mint, dill, and cumin. But you have neglected the weightier matters of the law—justice, mercy, and faithfulness. You should have practised these, without neglecting the others.

## Matthew 23:24

You blind guides! You filter out a gnat while you swallow a camel.

## Matthew 23:25

“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You cleanse the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence.

## Matthew 23:26

Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside will also be clean.

## Matthew 23:27

“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and all uncleanness.

## Matthew 23:28

In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.

## Matthew 23:29

“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You build the tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous.

## Matthew 23:30

And you say, ‘If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would not have been partners with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.’

## Matthew 23:31

In saying this, you acknowledge that you are descendants of those who murdered the prophets.

## Matthew 23:32

So then, fulfill what your ancestors began!

## Matthew 23:33

You serpents! You brood of vipers! How will you escape being sentenced to hell?

## Matthew 23:34

Therefore, I am sending you prophets, sages, and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify; others you will flog in your synagogues and persecute from town to town.

## Matthew 23:35

And so upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah son of Berekiah, whom you killed between the temple and the altar.

## Matthew 23:36

Truly, I tell you, all this will fall upon this generation.

## Matthew 23:37

“Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have desired to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing.

## Matthew 23:38

Behold, your house is left to you desolate.

## Matthew 23:39

For I tell you, you will only see me again when you proclaim, ‘Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.’”
