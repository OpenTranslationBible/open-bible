# Matthew Chapter 2

## Matthew 2:1

After Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea during the reign of King Herod, magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem,

## Matthew 2:2

asking, “Where is the one who has been born King of the Jews? We saw His star at its rising and have come to worship Him.”

## Matthew 2:3

When King Herod heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.

## Matthew 2:4

He gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people and inquired of them where the Messiah was to be born.

## Matthew 2:5

They told him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for this is what the prophet has written:

## Matthew 2:6

‘And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for out of you will come a ruler who will shepherd My people Israel.’”

## Matthew 2:7

Then Herod secretly called the magi and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared.

## Matthew 2:8

He sent them to Bethlehem and said, “Go and search diligently for the child. When you have found Him, report to me, so that I too may go and worship Him.”

## Matthew 2:9

After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen at its rising went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.

## Matthew 2:10

When they saw the star, they rejoiced with great joy.

## Matthew 2:11

Upon entering the house, they saw the child with His mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshipped Him. Then they opened their treasures and presented Him with gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.

## Matthew 2:12

And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another route.

## Matthew 2:13

After they had left, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, “Get up, take the child and His mother, and flee to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to destroy Him.”

## Matthew 2:14

So Joseph got up, took the child and His mother by night, and departed for Egypt,

## Matthew 2:15

where he stayed until the death of Herod. This was to fulfil what the Lord had spoken through the prophet: “Out of Egypt I called My Son.”

## Matthew 2:16

When Herod realised that he had been deceived by the magi, he was furious, and he sent orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, according to the time he had learned from the magi.

## Matthew 2:17

Then what was spoken through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:

## Matthew 2:18

“A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more.”

---

## Matthew 2:19

After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,

## Matthew 2:20

saying, “Get up, take the child and His mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child’s life are dead.”

## Matthew 2:21

So Joseph got up, took the child and His mother, and went to the land of Israel.

## Matthew 2:22

But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the region of Galilee,

## Matthew 2:23

and went and lived in a town called Nazareth. This was to fulfil what was spoken through the prophets: “He will be called a Nazarene.”
