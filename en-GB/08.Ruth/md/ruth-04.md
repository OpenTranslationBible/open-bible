# Ruth Chapter 4

## Ruth 4:1

Boaz went up to the town gate and sat down there, and just then, the redeemer Boaz had mentioned was passing by. Boaz said, “Come over here, my friend, and sit down.” So he came over and sat down.

## Ruth 4:2

Boaz then took ten of the town's elders and said, “Sit here.” And they sat down.

## Ruth 4:3

He spoke to the redeemer, “Naomi, who has returned from Moab, is selling the piece of land that belonged to our relative Elimelech.

## Ruth 4:4

I thought I should inform you and suggest that you buy it in the presence of those sitting here and in the presence of the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, do so; but if not, let me know, for you have the right to redeem it, and I am next in line.” The redeemer said, “I will redeem it.”

## Ruth 4:5

Then Boaz said, “On the day you buy the land from Naomi, you also acquire Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of the deceased, to maintain the name of the dead with his inheritance.”

## Ruth 4:6

The redeemer replied, “I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I jeopardise my own estate. You take my right of redemption for yourself, for I cannot do it.”

## Ruth 4:7

In earlier times in Israel, for the redemption and transfer of property to be finalised, one party would remove his sandal and give it to the other. This was the method of legalising transactions in Israel.

## Ruth 4:8

The redeemer then told Boaz, “Purchase it yourself.” And he took off his sandal.

## Ruth 4:9

Then Boaz declared to the elders and all the people, “Today you are witnesses that I have bought from Naomi all that belonged to Elimelech, Kilion, and Mahlon.

## Ruth 4:10

I have also acquired Ruth the Moabitess, Mahlon's widow, to be my wife, to maintain the name of the deceased with his property, so that his name will not disappear from among his family or from his hometown. You are witnesses today.”

## Ruth 4:11

Then all the people at the gate and the elders said, “We are witnesses. May the Lord make the woman who is coming into your home like Rachel and Leah, who together built up the house of Israel. May you prosper in Ephrathah and be renowned in Bethlehem.

## Ruth 4:12

May your family, through the children the Lord gives you by this young woman, be like that of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah.”

## Ruth 4:13

So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife. When he had relations with her, the Lord enabled her to conceive, and she gave birth to a son.

## Ruth 4:14

The women said to Naomi, “Praise be to the Lord, who this day has not left you without a redeemer. May he become famous throughout Israel!

## Ruth 4:15

He will renew your life and sustain you in your old age. For your daughter-in-law, who loves you and is better to you than seven sons, has given birth to him.”

## Ruth 4:16

Naomi took the child, laid him in her lap, and cared for him.

## Ruth 4:17

The neighbour women said, “Naomi has a son!” And they named him Obed. He was the father of Jesse, the father of David.

## Ruth 4:18

This is the lineage of Perez: Perez was the father of Hezron,

## Ruth 4:19

Hezron was the father of Ram, Ram was the father of Amminadab,

## Ruth 4:20

Amminadab was the father of Nahshon, Nahshon was the father of Salmon,

## Ruth 4:21

Salmon was the father of Boaz, Boaz was the father of Obed,

## Ruth 4:22

Obed was the father of Jesse, and Jesse was the father of David.
