# Ruth Chapter 1

## Ruth 1:1

In the days when the judges governed, there was a famine in the land. A man from Bethlehem in Judah went to reside in the country of Moab with his wife and two sons.

## Ruth 1:2

The man’s name was Elimelech, his wife was Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem, Judah. They entered Moab and lived there.

## Ruth 1:3

Elimelech, Naomi’s husband, passed away, leaving her with her two sons.

## Ruth 1:4

They took Moabite women as wives; one was named Orpah and the other Ruth. They lived there for about ten years.

## Ruth 1:5

Both Mahlon and Chilion also died, leaving Naomi without her two sons and her husband.

## Ruth 1:6

Naomi heard in Moab that the Lord had visited His people by providing them with food. She and her daughters-in-law prepared to return from there.

## Ruth 1:7

She departed from the place where she had been living, with her two daughters-in-law, and set out on the road to return to the land of Judah.

## Ruth 1:8

Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go back, each of you, to your mother’s house. May the Lord show kindness to you, as you have shown to the dead and to me.

## Ruth 1:9

May the Lord grant that each of you will find rest in the home of another husband.” Then she kissed them, and they wept aloud.

## Ruth 1:10

They responded to her, “We will go back with you to your people.”

## Ruth 1:11

But Naomi said, “Return home, my daughters. Why would you come with me? Am I going to have any more sons who could become your husbands?

## Ruth 1:12

Return, my daughters; I am too old to have a husband. Even if I thought there was still hope—even if I had a husband tonight and gave birth to sons—

## Ruth 1:13

would you wait until they grew up? Would you refrain from marrying? No, my daughters. It is more bitter for me than for you, because the Lord’s hand has turned against me!”

## Ruth 1:14

They wept aloud again. Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, but Ruth clung to her.

## Ruth 1:15

Naomi said, “Look, your sister-in-law is going back to her people and her gods. Go back with her.”

## Ruth 1:16

But Ruth replied, “Do not urge me to leave you or to turn back from following you. Where you go, I will go, and where you stay, I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God.

## Ruth 1:17

Where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried. May the Lord deal with me, be it ever so severely, if anything but death separates you and me.”

## Ruth 1:18

When Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her, she ceased trying to persuade her.

## Ruth 1:19

The two women went on until they came to Bethlehem. When they arrived in Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them, and the women exclaimed, “Is this Naomi?”

## Ruth 1:20

She said to them, “Do not call me Naomi; call me Mara, for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.

## Ruth 1:21

I went away full, but the Lord has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi? The Lord has testified against me, and the Almighty has afflicted me.”

## Ruth 1:22

So Naomi returned from Moab with Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, arriving in Bethlehem as the barley harvest was beginning.
