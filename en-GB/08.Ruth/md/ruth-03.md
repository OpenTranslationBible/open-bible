# Ruth Chapter 3

## Ruth 3:1

Naomi, Ruth’s mother-in-law, said to her, “My daughter, should I not seek a place of security for you, so that it may be well with you?

## Ruth 3:2

Now, Boaz, with whose young women you have been working, is a relative of ours. Behold, he will be winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor.

## Ruth 3:3

Therefore, wash yourself, anoint yourself, put on your best clothes, and go down to the threshing floor. However, do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking.

## Ruth 3:4

When he lies down, take note of the place where he is lying. Then you shall go, uncover his feet, and lie down; he will tell you what you should do.”

## Ruth 3:5

Ruth replied, “I will do everything you say.”

## Ruth 3:6

So she went down to the threshing floor and did all that her mother-in-law instructed her.

## Ruth 3:7

After Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the grain pile. Ruth came quietly, uncovered his feet, and lay down.

## Ruth 3:8

In the middle of the night, the man was startled and bent forward; there was a woman lying at his feet.

## Ruth 3:9

He asked, “Who are you?” She replied, “I am Ruth, your servant. Spread your garment over your servant, for you are a guardian-redeemer.”

## Ruth 3:10

He said, “May the Lord bless you, my daughter. This last kindness is greater than the first, as you have not pursued young men, whether rich or poor.

## Ruth 3:11

Now, my daughter, do not be afraid. I will do for you whatever you ask, for all the people of my town know that you are a woman of noble character.

## Ruth 3:12

It is true that I am a guardian-redeemer, but there is another who is more closely related than I.

## Ruth 3:13

Stay here for the night, and in the morning, if he wishes to redeem you, good; let him redeem you. But if he is not willing, as surely as the Lord lives, I will redeem you. Lie here until morning.”

## Ruth 3:14

So she lay at his feet until morning, but rose before anyone could be recognised; and he said, “Let it not be known that a woman came to the threshing floor.”

## Ruth 3:15

He said, “Bring the shawl you are wearing and hold it out.” When she held it, he measured six measures of barley and laid it on her. Then she went back to the town.

## Ruth 3:16

When Ruth returned to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked, “How did it go, my daughter?” Ruth told her all that Boaz had done for her.

## Ruth 3:17

She added, “He gave me these six measures of barley, saying, ‘Do not go back to your mother-in-law empty-handed.’”

## Ruth 3:18

Naomi said, “Wait, my daughter, until you see how the matter turns out; for the man will not rest until he has settled the matter today.”
