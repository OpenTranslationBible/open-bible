# 1 Thessalonians Chapter 2

## 1 Thessalonians 2:1

For you yourselves know, brothers and sisters, that our reception among you was not without result.

## 1 Thessalonians 2:2

But after we had already faced suffering and mistreatment in Philippi, as you know, we found courage in our God to share with you the gospel of God despite much opposition.

## 1 Thessalonians 2:3

For our exhortation does not arise from error or impurity or through deceit;

## 1 Thessalonians 2:4

but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not aiming to please people, but to please God, who examines our hearts.

## 1 Thessalonians 2:5

For we never came with flattering speech, as you know, nor with a motive for greed—God is our witness—

## 1 Thessalonians 2:6

nor did we seek honour from people, either from you or from others, though we could have asserted our authority as apostles of Christ.

## 1 Thessalonians 2:7

But we showed ourselves to be gentle among you. As a nursing mother tenderly cares for her own children,

## 1 Thessalonians 2:8

in the same way we had a deep affection for you and were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of God, but also our own lives, because you had become very dear to us.

## 1 Thessalonians 2:9

For you recall, brothers and sisters, our labour and hardship: it was by working night and day so as not to be a burden to any of you, that we proclaimed to you the gospel of God.

## 1 Thessalonians 2:10

You are witnesses, and so is God, of how devoutly and rightly and blamelessly we conducted ourselves toward you believers;

## 1 Thessalonians 2:11

as you are aware, we encouraged, comforted, and urged each of you, like a father with his own children,

## 1 Thessalonians 2:12

so that you would live in a manner worthy of the God who calls you into His own kingdom and glory.

## 1 Thessalonians 2:13

For this reason we also constantly thank God that when you received the word of God which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of mere men, but as what it truly is, the word of God, which also is at work in you who believe.

## 1 Thessalonians 2:14

For you, brothers and sisters, became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus that are in Judea, for you also endured the same sufferings at the hands of your own countrymen, just as they did from the Jews,

## 1 Thessalonians 2:15

who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out. They are not pleasing to God, but are hostile to all people,

## 1 Thessalonians 2:16

hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved; with the result that they always reach the limit of their sins. The wrath has come upon them fully.

## 1 Thessalonians 2:17

But we, brothers and sisters, having been separated from you for a short while—in person, not in spirit—were all the more eager with great desire to see your face.

## 1 Thessalonians 2:18

For we wanted to come to you—I, Paul, more than once—and yet Satan obstructed us.

## 1 Thessalonians 2:19

For who is our hope, or joy, or crown of pride? Is it not indeed you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus at His coming?

## 1 Thessalonians 2:20

For you are indeed our pride and joy.
