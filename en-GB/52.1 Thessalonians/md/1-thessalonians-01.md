# 1 Thessalonians Chapter 1

## 1 Thessalonians 1:1

Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy,  
To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:  
Grace to you and peace.

## 1 Thessalonians 1:2

We continually express our gratitude to God for all of you, remembering you in our prayers;

## 1 Thessalonians 1:3

constantly keeping in mind your work of faith, labour of love, and perseverance of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the presence of our God and Father,

## 1 Thessalonians 1:4

being aware, dear brothers and sisters loved by God, of His selection of you;

## 1 Thessalonians 1:5

for our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction—just as you know what kind of men we proved to be among you for your sake.

## 1 Thessalonians 1:6

You became followers of us and of the Lord, having embraced the word amidst great affliction with the joy of the Holy Spirit,

## 1 Thessalonians 1:7

so that you served as a model to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia.

## 1 Thessalonians 1:8

For the word of the Lord has echoed from you, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith in God has become known, so that we have no need to say anything.

## 1 Thessalonians 1:9

For they themselves recount to us the kind of welcome we received from you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God,

## 1 Thessalonians 1:10

and to await His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead—Jesus, who delivers us from the impending wrath.
