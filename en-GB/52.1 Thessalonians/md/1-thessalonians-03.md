# 1 Thessalonians Chapter 3

## 1 Thessalonians 3:1

Therefore, when we could no longer endure it, we decided to be left behind alone in Athens,

## 1 Thessalonians 3:2

and we sent Timothy, our brother and co-worker in spreading the gospel of Christ, to support and uplift you in your faith,

## 1 Thessalonians 3:3

so that no one would be unsettled by these troubles; for you yourselves know that we were meant for this.

## 1 Thessalonians 3:4

For even when we were with you, we kept forewarning you that we were going to face hardship; and it came to pass, as you know.

## 1 Thessalonians 3:5

For this reason, when I could no longer endure it, I also sent to find out about your faith, for fear that the tempter might have tempted you, and our labour would be in vain.

## 1 Thessalonians 3:6

But now that Timothy has come to us from you, and has brought us good news of your faith and love, and that you always think kindly of us, desiring to see us just as we also long to see you,

## 1 Thessalonians 3:7

for that reason, brothers and sisters, in all our distress and affliction we were comforted about you through your faith;

## 1 Thessalonians 3:8

for now we truly live, if you remain steadfast in the Lord.

## 1 Thessalonians 3:9

For what thanks can we give to God for you in return for all the joy with which we rejoice before our God because of you,

## 1 Thessalonians 3:10

as we keep praying most earnestly night and day, that we may see you face to face and may supply what is lacking in your faith?

## 1 Thessalonians 3:11

Now may our God and Father Himself, and our Lord Jesus, guide our way to you;

## 1 Thessalonians 3:12

and may the Lord cause you to grow and abound in love for one another, and for all people, just as we also do for you;

## 1 Thessalonians 3:13

so that He may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all His holy ones.
