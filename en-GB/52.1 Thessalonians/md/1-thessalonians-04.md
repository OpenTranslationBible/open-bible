# 1 Thessalonians Chapter 4

## 1 Thessalonians 4:1

Finally then, brothers and sisters, we ask and urge you in the Lord Jesus, that as you received instruction from us as to how you ought to walk and please God (just as you actually do walk), that you excel even more.

## 1 Thessalonians 4:2

For you are aware of the instruction we provided you through the authority of the Lord Jesus.

## 1 Thessalonians 4:3

For this is God's desire for you, your sanctification: that you refrain from sexual immorality;

## 1 Thessalonians 4:4

that each of you know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honour,

## 1 Thessalonians 4:5

not in passionate desires, like those who do not know God;

## 1 Thessalonians 4:6

and that no one wrong or exploit their brother or sister in this matter, because the Lord is the one who brings justice in all these things, just as we also told you previously and solemnly warned you.

## 1 Thessalonians 4:7

For God has not called us to impurity, but to live a holy life.

## 1 Thessalonians 4:8

Therefore, the one who rejects this is not rejecting man, but God, who gives His Holy Spirit to you.

## 1 Thessalonians 4:9

Now concerning the love for one another, you have no need for anyone to write to you, for you yourselves are taught by God to love each other;

## 1 Thessalonians 4:10

for you indeed show this love to all the brothers and sisters throughout Macedonia. Yet we encourage you, brothers and sisters, to excel even more,

## 1 Thessalonians 4:11

and to aspire to lead a quiet life, mind your own affairs, and work with your hands, just as we instructed you,

## 1 Thessalonians 4:12

so that you will conduct yourselves properly toward outsiders and not be dependent on anyone.

## 1 Thessalonians 4:13

But we do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, about those who have passed away, so that you will not grieve like the rest of mankind, who have no hope.

## 1 Thessalonians 4:14

For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, so also God will bring with Him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus.

## 1 Thessalonians 4:15

For we declare to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will not precede those who have fallen asleep.

## 1 Thessalonians 4:16

For the Lord Himself will come down from heaven with a commanding shout, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.

## 1 Thessalonians 4:17

After that, we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and thus we will always be with the Lord.

## 1 Thessalonians 4:18

So therefore, encourage one another with these words.
