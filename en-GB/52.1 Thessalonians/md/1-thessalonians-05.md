# 1 Thessalonians Chapter 5

## 1 Thessalonians 5:1

Now concerning the times and seasons, dear friends, you have no need for anything to be written to you.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:2

For you are well aware that the day of the Lord will arrive unexpectedly, like a thief in the night.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:3

While they are saying, “Peace and safety!” then sudden destruction will come upon them like labour pains upon a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:4

But you, dear friends, are not in darkness, so that the day would surprise you like a thief;

## 1 Thessalonians 5:5

for you are all children of light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to darkness;

## 1 Thessalonians 5:6

Therefore, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us remain alert and clear-minded.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:7

For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who are drunk, get drunk at night.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:8

But as we belong to the day, let us remain clear-minded, having put on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:9

For God has not appointed us to suffer wrath, but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,

## 1 Thessalonians 5:10

who died for us, so that whether we are alert or at rest, we may live together with Him.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:11

Therefore, encourage each other and build each other up, just as you are already doing.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:12

But we ask you, dear friends, to acknowledge those who work hard among you, who care for you in the Lord, and who instruct you,

## 1 Thessalonians 5:13

and to hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work. Live in peace with each other.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:14

We urge you, dear friends, warn those who are idle and disruptive, encourage the disheartened, help the weak, be patient with everyone.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:15

Ensure that nobody repays wrong for wrong, but always strive to do what is good for each other and for everyone else.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:16

Rejoice always,

## 1 Thessalonians 5:17

pray continually,

## 1 Thessalonians 5:18

express gratitude in all circumstances; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:19

Do not quench the Spirit,

## 1 Thessalonians 5:20

do not contemptuously disregard prophecies.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:21

Instead, examine them all; hold on to what is good,

## 1 Thessalonians 5:22

reject every kind of evil.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:23

Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely; and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:24

The One who calls you is faithful, and He will surely do it.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:25

Dear friends, pray for us.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:26

Greet all the brothers and sisters with a holy kiss.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:27

I urge you before the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers and sisters.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:28

The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
