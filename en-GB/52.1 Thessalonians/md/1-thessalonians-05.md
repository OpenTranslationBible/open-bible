# 1 Thessalonians Chapter 5

## 1 Thessalonians 5:1

Now as to the periods and times, brothers and sisters, you have no need of anything to be written to you.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:2

For you yourselves know full well that the day of the Lord is coming just like a thief in the night.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:3

While they are saying, “Peace and safety!” then sudden destruction will come upon them like labour pains upon a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:4

But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness, so that the day would overtake you like a thief;

## 1 Thessalonians 5:5

for you are all sons of light and sons of day. We are not of night nor of darkness;

## 1 Thessalonians 5:6

so then, let’s not sleep as others do, but let’s be alert and sober.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:7

For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who are drunk, get drunk at night.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:8

But since we are of the day, let’s be sober, having put on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet, the hope of salvation.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:9

For God has not destined us for wrath, but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,

## 1 Thessalonians 5:10

who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep, we will live together with Him.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:11

Therefore, encourage one another and build one another up, just as you also are doing.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:12

But we ask you, brothers and sisters, to recognise those who diligently labour among you and are in leadership over you in the Lord, and give you instruction,

## 1 Thessalonians 5:13

and that you regard them very highly in love because of their work. Live in peace with one another.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:14

We urge you, brothers and sisters, admonish the unruly, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with everyone.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:15

See that no one repays another with evil for evil, but always seek what is good for one another and for all people.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:16

Rejoice always,

## 1 Thessalonians 5:17

pray without ceasing,

## 1 Thessalonians 5:18

in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:19

Do not quench the Spirit,

## 1 Thessalonians 5:20

do not despise prophetic utterances.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:21

But examine everything; hold firmly to that which is good,

## 1 Thessalonians 5:22

abstain from every form of evil.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:23

Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you entirely; and may your spirit, soul, and body be kept complete, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:24

Faithful is He who calls you, and He also will do it.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:25

Brothers and sisters, pray for us.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:26

Greet all the brothers and sisters with a holy kiss.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:27

I put you under oath by the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers and sisters.

## 1 Thessalonians 5:28

The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
