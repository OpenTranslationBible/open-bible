# Nehemiah Chapter 9

## Nehemiah 9:1

Now on the twenty-fourth day of this month the sons of Israel assembled with fasting,  
in sackcloth and with dirt upon them.

## Nehemiah 9:2

And the descendants of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners,  
and they stood and confessed their sins and the wrongdoings of their fathers.

## Nehemiah 9:3

While they stood in their places,  
they read from the Book of the Law of the Lord their God for a fourth of the day;  
and for another fourth they confessed and worshipped the Lord their God.

## Nehemiah 9:4

Then Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani stood on the platform of the Levites,  
and cried out with a loud voice to the Lord their God.

## Nehemiah 9:5

Then the Levites, Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah said,

“Arise, bless the Lord your God forever and ever!  
May Your glorious name be blessed  
And exalted above all blessing and praise!

## Nehemiah 9:6

You alone are the Lord.  
You have made the heavens,  
The heaven of heavens with all their lights,  
The earth and everything that is on it,  
The seas and everything that is in them.  
You give life to all of them,  
And the heavenly lights bow down before You.

## Nehemiah 9:7

You are the Lord God,  
Who chose Abram  
And brought him out from Ur of the Chaldees,  
And gave him the name Abraham.

## Nehemiah 9:8

You found his heart faithful before You,  
And made a covenant with him  
To give him the land of the Canaanite,  
Of the Hittite and the Amorite,  
Of the Perizzite, the Jebusite, and the Girgashite—  
To give it to his descendants.  
And You have fulfilled Your word,  
For You are righteous.

## Nehemiah 9:9

You saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt,  
And heard their cry by the Red Sea.

## Nehemiah 9:10

Then You performed signs and wonders against Pharaoh,  
Against all his servants and all the people of his land;  
For You knew that they acted arrogantly toward them,  
And You made a name for Yourself as it is to this day.

## Nehemiah 9:11

You divided the sea before them,  
So they passed through the midst of the sea on dry ground;  
And You hurled their pursuers into the depths,  
Like a stone into raging waters.

## Nehemiah 9:12

And with a pillar of cloud You led them by day,  
And with a pillar of fire by night  
To light for them the way  
In which they were to go.

---

## Nehemiah 9:13

Then You came down on Mount Sinai,  
And spoke with them from heaven;  
You gave them just ordinances and true laws,  
Good statutes and commandments.

## Nehemiah 9:14

So You made known to them Your holy Sabbath,  
And gave them commandments, statutes, and law  
Through Your servant Moses.

## Nehemiah 9:15

You gave them bread from heaven for their hunger,  
You brought water from a rock for them for their thirst,  
And You told them to enter in  
To take possession of the land  
Which You swore to give them.

---

## Nehemiah 9:16

But they, our fathers, acted arrogantly;  
They became stubborn and would not listen to Your commandments.

## Nehemiah 9:17

They refused to listen,  
And did not remember Your wondrous deeds which You performed among them;  
So they became stubborn and appointed a leader  
To return to their slavery in Egypt.  
But You are a God of forgiveness,  
Gracious and compassionate,  
Slow to anger and abounding in mercy,  
And You did not abandon them.

## Nehemiah 9:18

Even when they made for themselves  
A calf of cast metal  
And said, ‘This is your god  
Who brought you up from Egypt,’  
And committed great blasphemies,

---

## Nehemiah 9:19

You, in Your great compassion,  
Did not abandon them in the wilderness;  
The pillar of cloud did not leave them by day,  
To guide them on their way,  
Nor the pillar of fire by night,  
To light for them the way in which they were to go.

## Nehemiah 9:20

You gave Your good Spirit to instruct them,  
Your manna You did not withhold from their mouth,  
And You gave them water for their thirst.

## Nehemiah 9:21

Indeed, for forty years You provided for them in the wilderness and they were not lacking;  
Their clothes did not wear out, nor did their feet swell.

---

## Nehemiah 9:22

You also gave them kingdoms and peoples,  
And allotted them to them as a boundary.  
So they took possession of the land of Sihon, the king of Heshbon,  
And the land of Og the king of Bashan.

## Nehemiah 9:23

You made their sons as numerous as the stars of heaven,  
And You brought them into the land  
Which You had told their fathers to enter and possess.

## Nehemiah 9:24

So their sons entered and took possession of the land.  
And You subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites,  
And gave them into their hand, with their kings and the peoples of the land,  
To do with them as they desired.

## Nehemiah 9:25

They captured fortified cities and a fertile land.  
They took possession of houses full of every good thing,  
Hewn cisterns, vineyards, olive groves,  
And fruit trees in abundance.  
So they ate, were filled, and grew fat,  
And delighted in Your great goodness.

---

## Nehemiah 9:26

But they became disobedient and rebelled against You,  
And threw Your Law behind their backs  
And killed Your prophets who had admonished them  
So that they might return to You,  
And they committed great blasphemies.

## Nehemiah 9:27

Therefore You handed them over to their oppressors who oppressed them,  
But when they cried out to You in the time of their distress,  
You heard from heaven,  
And in Your great compassion You gave them deliverers  
Who rescued them from the hand of their oppressors.

---

## Nehemiah 9:28

But as soon as they had rest, they did evil again before You;  
So You abandoned them to the hand of their enemies,  
So that they ruled over them.  
When they cried out to You again,  
You heard from heaven,  
And many times You rescued them according to Your compassion.

---

## Nehemiah 9:29

And You admonished them in order to turn them back to Your Law.  
Yet they acted arrogantly and did not listen to Your commandments  
But sinned against Your ordinances,  
By which if a person follows them he shall live.  
And they turned a stubborn shoulder, stiffened their neck, and would not listen.

## Nehemiah 9:30

However, You remained patient with them for many years,  
And admonished them by Your Spirit through Your prophets,  
Yet they would not give ear.  
Therefore You gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.

## Nehemiah 9:31

Nevertheless, in Your great compassion  
You did not make an end of them or abandon them,  
For You are a gracious and compassionate God.

---

## Nehemiah 9:32

Now then, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God,  
who keeps covenant and faithfulness,  
do not let all the hardship seem insignificant before You,  
Which has come upon us, our kings, our leaders, our priests, our prophets, our fathers,  
and on all Your people,  
From the days of the kings of Assyria to this day.

## Nehemiah 9:33

You are righteous in everything that has happened to us;  
for You have dealt faithfully, but we have acted wickedly.

## Nehemiah 9:34

For our kings, our leaders, our priests, and our fathers have not kept Your Law  
Or paid attention to Your commandments and Your testimonies with which You have admonished them.

## Nehemiah 9:35

But they, in their own kingdom,  
With Your great goodness which You gave them,  
With the broad and rich land which You placed before them,  
Did not serve You or turn from their evil deeds.

---

## Nehemiah 9:36

Behold, we are slaves today,  
And as to the land which You gave our fathers to eat of its fruit and its bounty,  
Behold, we are slaves in it.

## Nehemiah 9:37

And its abundant produce is for the kings whom You have set over us because of our sins;  
They rule over our bodies and our livestock as they please,  
So we are in great distress.

---

## Nehemiah 9:38

Now because of all this,  
We are making an agreement in writing;  
And on the sealed document are the names of our leaders, our Levites, and our priests.
