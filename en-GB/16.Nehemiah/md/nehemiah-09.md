But they, our ancestors, acted arrogantly and became stiff-necked, and they did not obey your commandments.

## Nehemiah 9:17

They refused to listen and did not remember the wondrous deeds you performed among them. They became stubborn and appointed a leader to return to their slavery. But you are a forgiving God, gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in mercy; you did not abandon them.

Even when they made for themselves a calf of cast metal and said, ‘This is your god who brought you up from Egypt,’ and committed great blasphemies,

## Nehemiah 9:28

But as soon as they had rest, they did evil again before you; therefore you abandoned them to the hand of their enemies, so they ruled over them. When they cried out to you again, you heard from heaven, and many times you rescued them according to your compassion.

## Nehemiah 9:29

You warned them to turn back to your law, but they acted arrogantly and did not listen to your commandments. They sinned against your ordinances, which, if a person follows them, he will live by them. They turned a stubborn shoulder and stiffened their neck, refusing to listen.

In all that has happened to us, you have remained righteous; you have acted faithfully, while we have acted wickedly.

## Nehemiah 9:34

Our kings, our leaders, our priests, and our ancestors did not follow your law or pay attention to your commandments and your admonitions with which you admonished them.

## Nehemiah 9:36

Behold, we are slaves today, slaves in the land you gave to our ancestors to eat its fruit and its bounty.

Because of our sins, its abundant produce goes to the kings you have set over us. They rule over our bodies and our cattle as they please, and we are in great distress.

## Nehemiah 9:38

Now because of all this, we are making a binding agreement in writing, and our leaders, our Levites, and our priests are affixing their seals to it.
