# Nehemiah Chapter 13

## Nehemiah 13:1

On that day, as the Book of Moses was read aloud in the hearing of the people, it was discovered that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever be admitted into the assembly of God,

## Nehemiah 13:2

because they did not meet the Israelites with bread and water, but instead hired Balaam to curse them. However, our God turned the curse into a blessing.

## Nehemiah 13:3

When they heard this law, they excluded all those of foreign descent from Israel.

## Nehemiah 13:4

Before this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the storerooms of the house of our God, was closely related to Tobiah,

## Nehemiah 13:5

and he had prepared a large room for him, which had previously been used to store the grain offerings, incense, temple articles, and the tithes of grain, new wine, and olive oil prescribed for the Levites, singers, and gatekeepers, as well as the contributions for the priests.

## Nehemiah 13:6

But during all this, I was not in Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon, I had returned to the king. Later, I requested leave of absence from the king

## Nehemiah 13:7

and returned to Jerusalem. There, I learned about the evil thing Eliashib had done for Tobiah by providing him a room in the courts of the house of God.

## Nehemiah 13:8

I was very displeased and threw all of Tobiah’s household goods out of the room.

## Nehemiah 13:9

I ordered the rooms to be purified, and then I restored the equipment of the house of God, along with the grain offerings and incense.

## Nehemiah 13:10

I also discovered that the portions assigned to the Levites had not been given to them, so the Levites and singers responsible for the service had returned to their own fields.

## Nehemiah 13:11

So I rebuked the officials and asked, “Why is the house of God neglected?” Then I gathered them together and stationed them at their posts.

## Nehemiah 13:12

All Judah then brought the tithes of grain, new wine, and olive oil into the storerooms.

## Nehemiah 13:13

I appointed Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and a Levite named Pedaiah to be in charge of the storerooms, and made Hanan son of Zakkur, the son of Mattaniah, their assistant, because they were considered reliable. They were responsible for distributing the supplies to their fellow Levites.

## Nehemiah 13:14

Remember me for this, my God, and do not erase what I have so faithfully done for the house of my God and its services.

## Nehemiah 13:15

In those days, I saw people in Judah treading winepresses on the Sabbath and bringing in sacks of grain, loading them on donkeys, along with wine, grapes, figs, and all kinds of loads. They were bringing all this into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. So I warned them against selling food on that day.

## Nehemiah 13:16

People from Tyre who lived in Jerusalem were bringing in fish and all kinds of merchandise and selling them to the people of Judah on the Sabbath, even in Jerusalem.

## Nehemiah 13:17

I reprimanded the nobles of Judah and said, “What is this wicked thing you are doing—desecrating the Sabbath day?

## Nehemiah 13:18

Did your ancestors not do the same things, causing our God to bring all this calamity upon us and upon this city? Now you are stirring up more wrath against Israel by desecrating the Sabbath.”

## Nehemiah 13:19

As evening shadows fell on the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath, I ordered the doors to be shut and not opened until after the Sabbath. I stationed some of my own men at the gates so that no load could be brought in on the Sabbath day.

## Nehemiah 13:20

On a few occasions, the merchants and sellers of various goods stayed the night outside Jerusalem.

## Nehemiah 13:21

But I warned them and said, “Why do you spend the night by the wall? If you do this again, I will use force against you.” From that time on, they no longer came on the Sabbath.

## Nehemiah 13:22

Then I commanded the Levites to purify themselves and to guard the gates in order to keep the Sabbath day holy. Remember me for this also, my God, and show mercy to me according to Your great love.

## Nehemiah 13:23

Furthermore, in those days I saw men of Judah who had married women from Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab.

## Nehemiah 13:24

Half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod or the language of one of the other peoples, and were not fluent in the language of Judah.

## Nehemiah 13:25

So I rebuked them and called curses down on them. I beat some of the men and pulled out their hair. I made them take an oath in God’s name and said: “You shall not give your daughters in marriage to their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves.

## Nehemiah 13:26

Did Solomon king of Israel not sin because of such marriages? Among the many nations there was no king like him. He was loved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel, yet even he was led into sin by foreign women.

## Nehemiah 13:27

Must we hear now that you too are committing all this great evil and are being unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women?”

## Nehemiah 13:28

One of the sons of Joiada, son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite. So I drove him away from me.

---

## Nehemiah 13:29

Remember them, my God, for they have brought disgrace upon the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites.

## Nehemiah 13:30

So I purified the priests and the Levites of everything foreign, and assigned duties to each, according to his task.

## Nehemiah 13:31

I also arranged for contributions of wood at designated times, and for the firstfruits. Remember me with kindness, my God.
