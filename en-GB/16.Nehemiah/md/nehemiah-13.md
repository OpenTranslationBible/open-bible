# Nehemiah Chapter 13

## Nehemiah 13:1

On that day they read aloud from the Book of Moses in the hearing of the people;  
and it was found written in it that no Ammonite or Moabite was ever to enter the assembly of God,

## Nehemiah 13:2

because they did not meet the sons of Israel with bread and water,  
but hired Balaam against them to curse them.  
However, our God turned the curse into a blessing.

## Nehemiah 13:3

So when they heard the Law, they excluded all foreigners from Israel.

## Nehemiah 13:4

Now prior to this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God,  
being related to Tobiah,

## Nehemiah 13:5

had prepared a large room for him,  
where previously they had put the grain offerings, the frankincense,  
the utensils, and the tithes of grain, wine, and oil prescribed for the Levites, the singers, and the gatekeepers,  
and the contributions for the priests.

## Nehemiah 13:6

But during all this time I was not in Jerusalem,  
for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I had gone to the king.  
After some time, however, I requested a leave from the king,

## Nehemiah 13:7

and I came to Jerusalem and discovered the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah,  
by preparing a room for him in the courtyards of the house of God.

## Nehemiah 13:8

It was very displeasing to me,  
so I threw all of Tobiah’s household belongings out of the room.

## Nehemiah 13:9

Then I gave an order, and they cleansed the rooms;  
and I returned the utensils of the house of God there with the grain offering and the frankincense.

---

## Nehemiah 13:10

I also discovered that the portions of the Levites had not been given to them,  
so that the Levites and the singers who performed the service had gone away, each to his own field.

## Nehemiah 13:11

So I reprimanded the officials and said,  
“Why is the house of God neglected?”  
Then I gathered them together and stationed them at their posts.

---

## Nehemiah 13:12

All Judah then brought the tithe of the grain, wine, and oil into the storehouses.

## Nehemiah 13:13

And I appointed as treasurers over the storehouses: Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe,  
and Pedaiah of the Levites,  
and in addition to them Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah;  
for they were considered trustworthy,  
and it was their duty to distribute to their kinsmen.

---

## Nehemiah 13:14

Remember me for this, my God,  
and do not erase my loyal deeds which I have performed for the house of my God and its services.

---

## Nehemiah 13:15

In those days I saw in Judah people who were treading wine presses on the Sabbath,  
and bringing in sacks of grain and loading them on donkeys,  
as well as wine, grapes, figs, and all kinds of loads,  
and bringing them into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day.  
So I admonished them on the day they sold food.

## Nehemiah 13:16

Also men of Tyre were living there who imported fish and all kinds of merchandise,  
and sold them on the Sabbath to the sons of Judah, and in Jerusalem.

## Nehemiah 13:17

Then I reprimanded the nobles of Judah and said to them,  
“What is this evil thing that you are doing, by profaning the Sabbath day?

## Nehemiah 13:18

Did your fathers not do the same,  
so that our God brought all this disaster on us and on this city?  
Yet you are adding to the wrath on Israel by profaning the Sabbath.”

---

## Nehemiah 13:19

So it came about that just as it grew dark at the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath,  
I commanded that the doors be shut,  
and that they not open them until after the Sabbath.  
Then I stationed some of my servants at the gates so that no load would enter on the Sabbath day.

## Nehemiah 13:20

Once or twice the merchants and sellers of every kind of merchandise spent the night outside Jerusalem.

## Nehemiah 13:21

Then I warned them and said to them,  
“Why are you spending the night in front of the wall? If you do it again, I will use force against you.”  
From that time on they did not come on the Sabbath.

## Nehemiah 13:22

And I commanded the Levites that they were to purify themselves and come as gatekeepers,  
to sanctify the Sabbath day.

For this also remember me, my God,  
and have compassion on me according to the greatness of Your faithfulness.

---

## Nehemiah 13:23

In those days I also saw that the Jews had married women from Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab.

## Nehemiah 13:24

As for their children, half spoke in the language of Ashdod,  
and none of them was able to speak the language of Judah,  
but only the language of his own people.

## Nehemiah 13:25

So I quarreled with them and cursed them,  
struck some of them and pulled out their hair,  
and made them swear by God,  
“You shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves.

## Nehemiah 13:26

Did Solomon the king of Israel not sin regarding these things?  
Yet among the many nations there was no king like him,  
and he was loved by his God,  
and God made him king over all Israel;  
nevertheless, the foreign women caused even him to sin.

## Nehemiah 13:27

Shall we then hear about you doing all this great evil by acting unfaithfully against our God,  
by marrying foreign women?”

---

## Nehemiah 13:28

Even one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest,  
was a son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite,  
so I chased him away from me.

---

## Nehemiah 13:29

Remember them, my God,  
because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites.

---

## Nehemiah 13:30

So I purified them from everything foreign,  
and assigned duties to the priests and the Levites,  
each to his task,

## Nehemiah 13:31

and I arranged for the supply of wood at the appointed times,  
and for the first fruits.

Remember me, my God, for good.
