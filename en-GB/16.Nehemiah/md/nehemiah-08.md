## Nehemiah 8:15

And they were to proclaim this message and spread it throughout their towns and in Jerusalem: “Go out to the hills and bring back branches from olive and wild olive trees, myrtles, palms, and other leafy trees to make temporary shelters, as it is written.”

So the people went out and brought back branches and built themselves temporary shelters on their roofs, in their courtyards, in the courts of the house of God, and in the square by the Water Gate and the one by the Gate of Ephraim.

The whole assembly that had returned from exile made temporary shelters and lived in them. From the days of Joshua son of Nun until that day, the Israelites had not celebrated in this way. And their joy was exceedingly great.

## Nehemiah 8:18

Day after day, from the first day to the last, Ezra read from the Book of the Law of God. They celebrated the festival for seven days, and on the eighth day, in accordance with the ordinance, there was a solemn assembly.
