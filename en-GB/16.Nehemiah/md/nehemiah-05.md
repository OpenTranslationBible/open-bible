# Nehemiah Chapter 5

## Nehemiah 5:1

Now there was a great outcry of the people and of their wives against their Jewish brothers.

## Nehemiah 5:2

For there were those who said,  
“We, our sons and our daughters, are many;  
therefore let us get grain, so that we may eat and live.”

## Nehemiah 5:3

There were others who said,  
“We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards, and our houses  
so that we might get grain because of the famine.”

## Nehemiah 5:4

Also there were those who said,  
“We have borrowed money for the king’s tax on our fields and our vineyards.

## Nehemiah 5:5

Now our flesh is like the flesh of our brothers,  
our children like their children.  
Yet behold, we are forcing our sons and our daughters to be slaves,  
and some of our daughters are forced into bondage already,  
and we have no power to redeem them because our fields and vineyards belong to others.”

## Nehemiah 5:6

Then I was very angry when I heard their outcry and these words.

## Nehemiah 5:7

So I considered this in my heart and contended with the nobles and the officials,  
and said to them,  
“You are charging interest, each from his brother!”  
Therefore, I held a great assembly against them.

## Nehemiah 5:8

And I said to them,  
“We, according to our ability, have redeemed our Jewish brothers who were sold to the nations;  
now would you even sell your brothers so that they may be sold to us?”  
Then they were silent and could not find a word to say.

## Nehemiah 5:9

So I said,  
“The thing which you are doing is not good.  
Should you not walk in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the nations, our enemies?

## Nehemiah 5:10

And likewise I, my brothers, and my servants are lending them money and grain.  
Please, let us stop this interest!

## Nehemiah 5:11

Please restore to them this very day their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses,  
also the hundredth part of the money and of the grain, the new wine, and the oil that you are charging them.”

## Nehemiah 5:12

Then they said,  
“We will restore it and require nothing from them; we will do exactly as you say.”  
So I called the priests and made them swear to do according to this promise.

## Nehemiah 5:13

I also shook out the front of my garment and said,  
“So may God shake out every person from his house and from his possessions who does not keep this promise;  
so may he be shaken out and emptied!”  
And all the assembly said, “Amen,” and they praised the Lord.  
Then the people did according to this promise.

## Nehemiah 5:14

Moreover, from the day I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah,  
from the twentieth year to the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes, twelve years,  
neither I nor my brothers ate the governor’s food allowance.

## Nehemiah 5:15

But the former governors who were before me laid heavy burdens on the people,  
and took from them bread and wine, in addition to forty shekels of silver.  
Even their servants domineered the people.  
But I did not do so, because of the fear of God.

## Nehemiah 5:16

I also applied myself to the work on this wall;  
we did not buy any land, and all my servants were gathered there for the work.

## Nehemiah 5:17

Moreover, there were at my table one hundred and fifty Jews and officials,  
besides those who came to us from the nations that were around us.

## Nehemiah 5:18

Now that which was prepared for each day was one ox and six choice sheep,  
also birds were prepared for me, and once in ten days all kinds of wine in abundance.  
Yet for all this, I did not request the governor’s food allowance,  
because the forced labour was heavy on this people.

## Nehemiah 5:19

Remember me, my God, for good,  
in accordance with all that I have done for this people.
