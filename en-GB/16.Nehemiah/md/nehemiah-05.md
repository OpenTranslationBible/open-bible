# Nehemiah Chapter 5

## Nehemiah 5:1

Now there was a significant outcry from the people and their wives against their Jewish brethren.

## Nehemiah 5:2

Some were saying, “We, along with our sons and daughters, are numerous; therefore, we need to obtain grain so that we may eat and live.”

## Nehemiah 5:3

Others said, “We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards, and our homes to procure grain because of the famine.”

## Nehemiah 5:4

There were also those who said, “We have borrowed money to pay the king’s tax on our fields and vineyards.

## Nehemiah 5:5

Now our flesh is the same as that of our brothers, our children are like their children. Yet, we are forcing our sons and daughters into slavery; some of our daughters have already been enslaved, and we are powerless because our fields and vineyards belong to others.”

## Nehemiah 5:6

When I heard their outcry and these words, I was exceedingly angry.

## Nehemiah 5:7

After considering the matter, I confronted the nobles and officials, saying, “You are charging interest to your own people!” So, I convened a large assembly against them.

## Nehemiah 5:8

I said to them, “As much as possible, we have redeemed our Jewish brothers who were sold to the Gentiles. Now you are selling your own brothers, only for them to be sold back to us!” They remained silent, unable to find a response.

## Nehemiah 5:9

So I continued, “What you are doing is not right. Should you not walk in the fear of our God to avoid the reproach of our Gentile enemies?

## Nehemiah 5:10

I, my brothers, and my men are also lending them money and grain. Let us cease this interest!

## Nehemiah 5:11

Please, restore to them this very day their fields, vineyards, olive groves, and houses, along with the interest you are charging them—the hundredth part of the money, grain, new wine, and oil.”

## Nehemiah 5:12

They responded, “We will restore it and will not demand anything more from them; we will do as you say.” Then I summoned the priests and made the nobles and officials take an oath to do what they had promised.

## Nehemiah 5:13

I also shook out the folds of my garment and declared, “In this way may God shake out of their house and possessions anyone who does not keep this promise. So may such a person be shaken out and emptied!” The whole assembly said, “Amen,” and praised the Lord. And the people did as they had promised.

## Nehemiah 5:14

Moreover, from the day I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year to the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes, for twelve years, neither I nor my brothers consumed the governor’s food allowance.

## Nehemiah 5:15

But the previous governors who were before me placed heavy burdens on the people and took from them forty shekels of silver in addition to bread and wine. Even their servants lorded it over the people. But I did not do so because of my reverence for God.

## Nehemiah 5:16

Instead, I devoted myself to the work on this wall. All my men were gathered there for the work; we did not acquire any land.

## Nehemiah 5:17

Furthermore, 150 Jews and officials ate at my table, besides those who came to us from the surrounding nations.

## Nehemiah 5:18

Each day, one ox, six choice sheep, and some poultry were prepared for me, and every ten days an abundant supply of all kinds of wine was provided. Despite all this, I did not demand the governor’s food allowance, because the demands were heavy on these people.

## Nehemiah 5:19

Remember me favourably, my God, for all that I have done for these people.
