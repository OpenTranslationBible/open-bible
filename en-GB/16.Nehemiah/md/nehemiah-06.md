# Nehemiah Chapter 6

## Nehemiah 6:1

Now when it was reported to Sanballat, Tobiah, to Geshem the Arab, and to the rest of our enemies  
that I had rebuilt the wall, and that no breach remained in it,  
though at that time I had not installed the doors in the gates,

## Nehemiah 6:2

Sanballat and Geshem sent a message to me, saying,  
“Come, let us meet together at Chephirim in the plain of Ono.”

---

But they were planning to harm me.

## Nehemiah 6:3

So I sent messengers to them, saying,  
“I am doing a great work and cannot come down.  
Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you?”

## Nehemiah 6:4

And they sent messages to me four times in this manner,  
and I answered them in the same way.

---

## Nehemiah 6:5

Then Sanballat sent his servant to me in the same manner a fifth time  
with an open letter in his hand.

## Nehemiah 6:6

In it was written:  
“It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu says,  
that you and the Jews are planning to rebel; therefore you are rebuilding the wall.  
And you are to be their king, according to these reports.

## Nehemiah 6:7

You have also appointed prophets to proclaim in Jerusalem concerning you,  
‘A king is in Judah!’  
And now it will be reported to the king according to these reports.  
So now, come, let us confer together.”

---

## Nehemiah 6:8

Then I sent a message to him, saying,  
“Nothing like these things that you are saying has been done,  
but you are inventing them in your own mind.”

## Nehemiah 6:9

For they all were trying to frighten us, thinking,  
“They will become discouraged with the work, and it will not be done.”

But now, God, strengthen my hands.

## Nehemiah 6:10

When I entered the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel,  
who was confined at home, he said,  
“Let us meet together in the house of God, inside the temple,  
and let us close the doors of the temple,  
for they are coming to kill you, and they are coming to kill you at night.”

---

## Nehemiah 6:11

But I said,  
“Should a man like me flee?  
And who is there like me who would go into the temple to save his own life?  
I will not go in.”

## Nehemiah 6:12

Then I realised that God had not sent him,  
but he had spoken this prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.

## Nehemiah 6:13

He was hired for this reason: that I would become frightened and act accordingly and sin,  
so that they might have an evil report by which to reproach me.

## Nehemiah 6:14

Remember, my God, Tobiah and Sanballat, in accordance with these works of theirs,  
and also Noadiah the prophetess and the rest of the prophets who were trying to frighten me.

---

## Nehemiah 6:15

So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty-two days.

## Nehemiah 6:16

When all our enemies heard about it,  
and all the nations surrounding us saw it,  
they lost their confidence;  
for they recognised that this work had been accomplished with the help of our God.

## Nehemiah 6:17

Also in those days many letters went from the nobles of Judah to Tobiah,  
and Tobiah’s letters came to them.

## Nehemiah 6:18

For many in Judah were bound by oath to him,  
because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah,  
and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.

## Nehemiah 6:19

Moreover, they were speaking of his good deeds in my presence and reported my words to him.  
Then Tobiah sent letters to frighten me.
