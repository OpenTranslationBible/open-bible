# Nehemiah Chapter 6

## Nehemiah 6:1
When it was reported to Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our adversaries that I had rebuilt the wall and that no gap was left in it—though at that time I had not yet set the doors in the gates—

## Nehemiah 6:2
Sanballat and Geshem sent me a message: “Come, let us meet together in one of the villages on the plain of Ono.” But they were plotting to harm me.

## Nehemiah 6:3
So I sent messengers to them, saying, “I am engaged in a significant work and cannot come down. Why should the work cease while I leave it and come down to you?”

## Nehemiah 6:4
They sent me the same message four times, and each time I gave them the same response.

## Nehemiah 6:5
Then, on the fifth occasion, Sanballat sent his servant to me with the same message, and in his hand was an open letter

## Nehemiah 6:6
which stated: “It is reported among the nations—and Gashmu confirms it—that you and the Jews are intending to rebel, and that is why you are rebuilding the wall. According to these reports, you are to become their king.

## Nehemiah 6:7
You have also appointed prophets to proclaim in Jerusalem, ‘There is a king in Judah!’ This report will reach the king; so let us confer together.”

## Nehemiah 6:8
I sent him this reply: “None of what you are saying has occurred; you are inventing it in your own mind.”

## Nehemiah 6:9
They were all trying to intimidate us, thinking, “Their hands will become too weak for the work, and it will not be finished.” But I prayed, “Now, God, strengthen my hands.”

## Nehemiah 6:10
I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel, who was confined at home. He said, “Let us meet in the house of God, inside the temple, and close the temple doors, for they are coming to kill you—at night they are coming to kill you.”

## Nehemiah 6:11
But I said, “Should a man like me flee? And who like me would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.”

## Nehemiah 6:12
Then I realised that God had not sent him, but he had uttered his prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.

## Nehemiah 6:13
He was hired to intimidate me so that I would act in fear and sin, and they might have grounds for an evil report to disgrace me.

## Nehemiah 6:14
Remember, my God, Tobiah and Sanballat for their deeds, and also the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who were trying to intimidate me.

## Nehemiah 6:15
Thus the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth of Elul, in fifty-two days.

## Nehemiah 6:16
When all our enemies heard of this, and all the surrounding nations saw it, they lost their confidence, for they realised that this work had been accomplished with the help of our God.

## Nehemiah 6:17
In those days, the nobles of Judah were sending many letters to Tobiah, and letters from Tobiah were coming to them.

## Nehemiah 6:18
For many in Judah were bound by oath to him, since he was son-in-law to Shecaniah son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berechiah.

## Nehemiah 6:19
Moreover, they were speaking of his good deeds in my presence, and reporting my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to intimidate me.
