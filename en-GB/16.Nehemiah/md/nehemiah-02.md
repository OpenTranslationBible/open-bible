# Nehemiah Chapter 2

## Nehemiah 2:1

And it came about in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes,  
that wine was before him, and I took up the wine and gave it to the king.  
Now I had not been sad in his presence before.

## Nehemiah 2:2

So the king said to me,  
“Why is your face sad, though you are not ill?  
This is nothing but sadness of heart.”  
Then I was very much afraid.

## Nehemiah 2:3

And I said to the king,  
“May the king live forever.  
Why should my face not be sad, when the city, the place of my ancestors’ tombs, lies desolate,  
and its gates have been destroyed by fire?”

## Nehemiah 2:4

Then the king said to me,  
“What is it that you are requesting?”  
So I prayed to the God of heaven.

## Nehemiah 2:5

And I said to the king,  
“If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favour before you,  
I ask that you send me to Judah, to the city of my ancestors’ tombs, so that I may rebuild it.”

## Nehemiah 2:6

Then the king said to me, with the queen sitting beside him,  
“How long will your journey be, and when will you return?”  
So it pleased the king to send me, and I gave him a definite time.

## Nehemiah 2:7

And I said to the king,  
“If it pleases the king, let letters be given to me  
for the governors of the provinces beyond the River,  
so that they will allow me to pass through until I come to Judah,

## Nehemiah 2:8

and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the king’s forest,  
that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the fortress which is by the temple,  
for the wall of the city, and for the house to which I will go.”  
And the king granted them to me because the good hand of my God was upon me.

## Nehemiah 2:9

Then I came to the governors of the provinces beyond the River and gave them the king’s letters.  
Now the king had sent with me officers of the army and horsemen.

## Nehemiah 2:10

When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about it,  
it was very displeasing to them that someone had come to seek the welfare of the sons of Israel.

## Nehemiah 2:11

So I came to Jerusalem and was there for three days.

## Nehemiah 2:12

Then I arose at night, I and a few men with me.  
I did not tell anyone what my God was putting into my heart to do for Jerusalem,  
and there was no animal with me except the one on which I was riding.

## Nehemiah 2:13

So I went out at night by the Valley Gate in the direction of the Dragon’s Spring and on to the Dung Gate,  
and I was inspecting the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down  
and its gates which had been destroyed by fire.

## Nehemiah 2:14

Then I passed on to the Fountain Gate and the King’s Pool,  
but there was no place for my mount to pass.

## Nehemiah 2:15

So I went up at night by the ravine and inspected the wall.  
Then I entered the Valley Gate again and returned.

## Nehemiah 2:16

The officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing,  
nor had I yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officials, or the rest who did the work.

## Nehemiah 2:17

Then I said to them,  
“You see the bad situation we are in,  
that Jerusalem is desolate and its gates have been burned by fire.  
Come, let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem, so that we will no longer be a disgrace.”

## Nehemiah 2:18

And I told them how the hand of my God had been favourable to me,  
and also about the king’s words which he had spoken to me.  
Then they said,  
“Let us arise and build.”  
So they strengthened their hands for the good work.

## Nehemiah 2:19

But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard it,  
they mocked us and despised us and said,  
“What is this that you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king?”

## Nehemiah 2:20

So I answered them and said to them,  
“The God of heaven will make us successful;  
therefore we His servants will arise and build,  
but you have no part, right, or memorial in Jerusalem.”
