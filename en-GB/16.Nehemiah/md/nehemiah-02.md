# Nehemiah Chapter 2

## Nehemiah 2:1

In the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, when wine was before him, I took the wine and gave it to the king. I had not been sad in his presence before.

## Nehemiah 2:2

So the king said to me, “Why does your face look sad when you are not ill? This can only be sadness of heart.” Then I was very much afraid.

## Nehemiah 2:3

And I said to the king, “May the king live forever! Why should my face not be sad when the city where my ancestors are buried lies desolate and its gates have been destroyed by fire?”

## Nehemiah 2:4

The king said to me, “What is it you would request?” So I prayed to the God of heaven.

## Nehemiah 2:5

And I said to the king, “If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favour in your sight, send me to Judah, to the city of my ancestors' tombs, that I may rebuild it.”

## Nehemiah 2:6

Then the king, with the queen sitting beside him, asked me, “How long will your journey take, and when will you return?” It pleased the king to send me, so I set a time.

## Nehemiah 2:7

I also said to the king, “If it pleases the king, may I have letters to the governors of the provinces beyond the River, so that they will allow me to pass through until I arrive in Judah?

## Nehemiah 2:8

And may I have a letter to Asaph, the keeper of the king’s forest, so that he will give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel by the temple, for the city wall, and for the house I will occupy?” And because the gracious hand of my God was upon me, the king granted my requests.

## Nehemiah 2:9

Then I went to the governors of the provinces beyond the Euphrates and gave them the king’s letters. The king had also sent army officers and horsemen with me.

## Nehemiah 2:10

When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard about this, they were very displeased that someone had come to seek the welfare of the Israelites.

## Nehemiah 2:11

Upon my arrival in Jerusalem, I stayed there for three whole days.

## Nehemiah 2:12

I set out during the night with a few others. I had not told anyone what my God had put in my heart to do for Jerusalem. There was no animal with me except the one I was riding on.

## Nehemiah 2:13

By night I went out through the Valley Gate towards the Dragon’s Spring and the Dung Gate, examining the walls of Jerusalem, which had been broken down, and its gates, which had been consumed by fire.

## Nehemiah 2:14

Then I moved on towards the Fountain Gate and the King’s Pool, but there was no room for my mount to pass through.

## Nehemiah 2:15

So I continued up the valley during the night, inspecting the wall. Finally, I returned and re-entered through the Valley Gate.

## Nehemiah 2:16

The officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing, because as yet I had said nothing to the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officials, or the rest who were to do the work.

## Nehemiah 2:17

Then I said to them, “You can see the situation we are in: Jerusalem is in ruins, and its gates have been burned. Come, let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem, so we will no longer be in disgrace.”

## Nehemiah 2:18

I also told them about the gracious hand of my God upon me and what the king had said to me. They replied, “Let us arise and build.” So they set their hands to this good work.

## Nehemiah 2:19

But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official, and Geshem the Arab heard about it, they mocked and ridiculed us. “What are you doing?” they asked. “Are you rebelling against the king?”

## Nehemiah 2:20

I answered them, saying, “The God of heaven will give us success. We, his servants, will start rebuilding, but as for you, you have no share, right, or historic claim in Jerusalem.”
