# Nehemiah Chapter 4

## Nehemiah 4:1
When Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he became furious and very angry, and he mocked the Jews.

## Nehemiah 4:2
He spoke in the presence of his associates and the army of Samaria, saying, “What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they restore their wall? Can they offer sacrifices? Will they complete it in a day? Can they revive the stones from the heaps of rubble, even the burned ones?”

## Nehemiah 4:3
Tobiah the Ammonite, who was near him, said, “What they are building—even if a fox were to climb on it, it would break their stone wall down!”

## Nehemiah 4:4
Hear us, O our God, for we are despised. Turn their insults back on their own heads and make them plunder in a land of captivity.

## Nehemiah 4:5
Do not cover up their guilt or let their sin be wiped out from your sight, for they have demoralised the builders.

## Nehemiah 4:6
So we rebuilt the wall till all of it reached half its height, for the people worked with all their heart.

## Nehemiah 4:7
When Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the repairs to Jerusalem’s walls had gone ahead and that the breaches were being closed, they were very angry.

## Nehemiah 4:8
They all conspired together to come and fight against Jerusalem and to cause confusion in it.

## Nehemiah 4:9
But we prayed to our God and posted a guard day and night to meet this threat.

## Nehemiah 4:10
Meanwhile, the people in Judah said, “The strength of the labourers is giving out, and there is so much rubble that we cannot rebuild the wall.”

## Nehemiah 4:11
Our enemies said, “Before they know it or see us, we will be right there among them and will kill them and put an end to the work.”

## Nehemiah 4:12
Then the Jews who lived near them came and told us ten times over, “Wherever you turn, they will attack us.”

## Nehemiah 4:13
Therefore I stationed some of the people behind the lowest points of the wall at the exposed places, posting them by families with their swords, spears, and bows.

## Nehemiah 4:14
After I looked things over, I stood up and said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people, “Do not be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight for your families, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your homes.”

## Nehemiah 4:15
When our enemies heard that we were aware of their plot and that God had frustrated it, we all returned to the wall, each to our own work.

## Nehemiah 4:16
From that day on, half of my men did the work, while the other half were equipped with spears, shields, bows, and armour. The officers posted themselves behind all the people of Judah.

## Nehemiah 4:17
Those who were building the wall and those who carried materials did their work with one hand and held a weapon in the other.

## Nehemiah 4:18
Each of the builders wore his sword at his side as he worked. But the man who sounded the trumpet stayed with me.

## Nehemiah 4:19
Then I said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people, “The work is extensive and spread out, and we are widely separated from each other along the wall.

## Nehemiah 4:20
Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, join us there. Our God will fight for us!”

## Nehemiah 4:21
So we continued the work with half the men holding spears, from the first light of dawn till the stars came out.

## Nehemiah 4:22
At that time I also said to the people, “Let every man and his helper stay inside Jerusalem at night, so they can serve as guards by night and as workers by day.”

## Nehemiah 4:23
Neither I nor my brothers nor my men nor the guards with me took off our clothes; each kept his weapon, even when he went for water.
