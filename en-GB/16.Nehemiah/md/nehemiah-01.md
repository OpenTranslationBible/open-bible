# Nehemiah Chapter 1

## Nehemiah 1:1

These are the words of Nehemiah, son of Hakaliah. During the month of Kislev, in the twentieth year, while I was in the citadel of Susa,

## Nehemiah 1:2

Hanani, one of my brothers, came with some men from Judah, and I asked them about the Jewish remnant that had survived the exile, and about Jerusalem.

## Nehemiah 1:3

They replied, “Those who survived the exile and are in the province are in great distress and disgrace. The wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates have been burned with fire.”

## Nehemiah 1:4

When I heard these words, I sat down and wept, mourning for several days. I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven.

## Nehemiah 1:5

I said, “O Lord, God of heaven, the great and awesome God, who keeps His covenant of love with those who love Him and keep His commandments,

## Nehemiah 1:6

please listen closely and look upon the prayer Your servant is offering before You day and night for Your servants, the people of Israel. I confess the sins we Israelites, including myself and my father's family, have committed against You.

## Nehemiah 1:7

We have acted very corruptly towards You. We have not obeyed the commands, decrees, and laws You gave Your servant Moses.

## Nehemiah 1:8

Remember the word You gave Your servant Moses, saying, ‘If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the nations,

## Nehemiah 1:9

but if you return to Me and obey My commands, then even if your exiled people are at the farthest horizon, I will gather them from there and bring them to the place I have chosen for My Name to dwell.’

## Nehemiah 1:10

They are Your servants and Your people, whom You have redeemed by Your great strength and Your mighty hand.

## Nehemiah 1:11

Lord, let Your ear be attentive to the prayer of this Your servant and to the prayer of Your servants who delight in revering Your name. Grant Your servant success today by granting him mercy in the presence of this man.” I was the cupbearer to the king.
