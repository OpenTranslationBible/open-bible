# Amos Chapter 8

## Amos 8:1

This is what the Lord God showed me, and behold, there was a basket of summer fruit.

## Amos 8:2

And He said, “What do you see, Amos?”  
And I said, “A basket of summer fruit.”  
Then the Lord said to me,  
“The end has come for My people Israel.  
I will not spare them any longer.

## Amos 8:3

The songs of the palace will turn to wailing on that day,” declares the Lord God.  
“The corpses will be many; in every place they will throw them out silently.”

## Amos 8:4

> Hear this, you who trample the needy, to put an end to the humble of the land,

## Amos 8:5

Saying,

> “When will the new moon be over, so that we may sell grain,  
> And the Sabbath, so that we may open the wheat market,  
> To make the ephah smaller and the shekel bigger,  
> And to cheat with dishonest scales,

## Amos 8:6

> So as to buy the helpless for money,  
> And the needy for a pair of sandals,  
> And that we may sell the refuse of the wheat?”

## Amos 8:7

The Lord has sworn by the pride of Jacob,  
“Indeed, I will never forget any of their deeds.

## Amos 8:8

> Because of this, will the land not quake,  
> And everyone who lives in it mourn?  
> Indeed, all of it will rise up like the Nile,  
> And it will be tossed about  
> And subside like the Nile of Egypt.

## Amos 8:9

And it will come about on that day,” declares the Lord God,

> “That I will make the sun go down at noon,  
> And make the earth dark in broad daylight.

## Amos 8:10

> Then I will turn your festivals into mourning,  
> And all your songs into lamentation;  
> And I will bring sackcloth on everyone’s loins,  
> And baldness on every head.  
> And I will make it like a time of mourning for an only son,  
> And the end of it will be like a bitter day.

## Amos 8:11

> Behold, days are coming,” declares the Lord God,  
> “When I will send a famine on the land,  
> Not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water,  
> But rather for hearing the words of the Lord.

## Amos 8:12

> And people will stagger from sea to sea,  
> And from the north even to the east;  
> They will roam about to seek the word of the Lord,  
> But they will not find it.

## Amos 8:13

On that day

> the beautiful virgins  
> And the young men will faint from thirst.

## Amos 8:14

> As for those who swear by the guilt of Samaria,  
> Who say, ‘As your god lives, Dan,’  
> And, ‘As the way of Beersheba lives,’  
> They will fall and not rise again.”
