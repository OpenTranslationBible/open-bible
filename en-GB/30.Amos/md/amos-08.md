# Amos Chapter 8

## Amos 8:1

This is what the Lord God revealed to me: a basket of summer fruit.

## Amos 8:2

And He asked, “What do you see, Amos?” I replied, “A basket of summer fruit.” Then the Lord said, “The end has come for My people Israel; I will spare them no longer.

## Amos 8:3

“In that day,” declares the Lord God, “the songs in the temple will turn to wailing. Many bodies will be flung everywhere! Silence!”

## Amos 8:4

> Listen to this, you who trample the needy and eliminate the humble of the land,

## Amos 8:5

> “When will the New Moon be over so that we may sell grain,
> and the Sabbath be ended so we may market wheat?”
> — reducing the measure, inflating the price,
> and cheating with dishonest scales,

## Amos 8:6

> buying the poor for silver
> and the needy for a pair of sandals,
> and selling even the refuse of the wheat.

## Amos 8:7

The Lord has sworn by the pride of Jacob:
“I will never forget any of their deeds.

## Amos 8:8

> Will not the land tremble because of this,
> and all who dwell in it mourn?
> The whole land will rise like the Nile;
> it will be stirred up
> and then subside like the river of Egypt.

## Amos 8:9

“And it shall come to pass on that day,” declares the Lord God,

> “that I will make the sun set at noon
> and darken the earth in broad daylight.

## Amos 8:10

> I will turn your festivals into mourning
> and all your singing into lamentation.
> I will make everyone wear sackcloth and shave their heads.
> I will make it like mourning for an only son
> and its end like a bitter day.

## Amos 8:11

> “Behold, the days are coming,” declares the Lord God,
> “when I will send a famine through the land
> —not a famine of bread or a thirst for water,
> but a famine of hearing the words of the Lord.

## Amos 8:12

> People will stagger from sea to sea
> and wander from north to east,
> searching for the word of the Lord,
> but they will not find it.

## Amos 8:13

On that day

> the beautiful young women
> and strong young men will faint from thirst.

## Amos 8:14

> Those who swear by the guilt of Samaria,
> who say, ‘As surely as your god lives, Dan,’
> or, ‘As the way of Beersheba lives,’
> they will fall, never to rise again.”
