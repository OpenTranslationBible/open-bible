# Amos Chapter 5

## Amos 5:1

Hear this word, O house of Israel, this lament I raise against you:

## Amos 5:2

> “Fallen is Virgin Israel,
> she shall rise no more.
> She lies forsaken on her land;
> there is no one to lift her up.”

## Amos 5:3

> For this is what the Sovereign Lord says to Israel:

> “The city that sends out a thousand
> will have a hundred left,
> and the one that sends out a hundred
> will have ten left.”

## Amos 5:4

For this is what the Lord says to the house of Israel:

> “Seek me, and you shall live.

## Amos 5:5

> Do not seek Bethel,
> do not go to Gilgal,
> and do not cross over to Beersheba;
> for Gilgal shall surely go into exile,
> and Bethel shall be reduced to nothing.”

## Amos 5:6

> Seek the Lord, and live,
> lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph,
> and it devour, with none to quench it for Bethel.

## Amos 5:7

> There are those who turn justice into bitterness
> and cast righteousness to the ground.

## Amos 5:8

> He who made the Pleiades and Orion,
> who turns deep darkness into morning
> and darkens day into night,
> who summons the waters of the sea
> and pours them out over the face of the earth
> — the Lord is his name.

## Amos 5:9

> He brings sudden destruction upon the stronghold,
> and ruin comes upon the fortified city.

## Amos 5:10

> They hate the one who reproves in the gate
> and despise the one who speaks the truth.

## Amos 5:11

> Therefore, because you impose heavy rent on the poor
> and take a levy of grain from them,
> though you have built houses of hewn stone,
> you shall not dwell in them;
> though you have planted delightful vineyards,
> you shall not drink their wine.

## Amos 5:12

> For I know how numerous your offenses are and how great your sins.
> You oppress the righteous, accept bribes,
> and turn aside the needy in the gate.

## Amos 5:13

> Therefore, the prudent keep silent at such a time,
> for it is an evil time.

## Amos 5:14

> Seek good and not evil, that you may live;
> and so the Lord God Almighty will be with you,
> just as you say.

## Amos 5:15

> Hate evil, love good,
> and establish justice in the gate.
> Perhaps the Lord God Almighty
> will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.

## Amos 5:16

Therefore, this is what the Lord, the Lord God Almighty, says:

> “There will be wailing in all the streets
> and cries of anguish in every public square.
> The farmers will be called to mourn,
> and the professional mourners to lamentation.

## Amos 5:17

> There will be wailing in all the vineyards,
> for I will pass through your midst,” says the Lord.

## Amos 5:18

> Woe to you who long for the day of the Lord!
> Why do you desire the day of the Lord?
> It will be darkness, not light.

## Amos 5:19

> It will be as if a man fled from a lion
> only to meet a bear,
> or as if he entered his house and leaned his hand on the wall
> only to be bitten by a snake.

## Amos 5:20

> Will not the day of the Lord be darkness, not
> light— pitch-dark, without a glimmer of brightness?

## Amos 5:21

> “I hate, I despise your festivals;
> your assemblies are a stench to me.

## Amos 5:22

> Even though you bring me burnt offerings and grain offerings,
> I will not accept them.
> I will not regard the peace offerings of your fattened animals.

## Amos 5:23

> Take away from me the noise of your songs;
> I will not listen to the melody of your harps.

## Amos 5:24

> But let justice roll on like a river,
> and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.

## Amos 5:25

> “Did you bring me sacrifices and offerings
> during the forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?

## Amos 5:26

> You have carried Sikkuth your king and Kiyyun your idols,
> the star of your gods that you made for yourselves.

## Amos 5:27

> Therefore I will send you into exile beyond Damascus,”

says the Lord, whose name is God Almighty.
