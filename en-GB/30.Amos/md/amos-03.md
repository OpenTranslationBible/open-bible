# Amos Chapter 3

## Amos 3:1

Hear this word that the Lord has spoken against you, O people of Israel, against the whole family that He brought up from the land of Egypt:

## Amos 3:2

> “You alone have I acknowledged among all the families of the earth;
> therefore, I will punish you for all your iniquities.”

## Amos 3:3

> Can two walk together unless they have agreed to meet?

## Amos 3:4

> Does a lion roar in the forest when it has no prey?
> Does a young lion growl from its den unless it has captured something?

## Amos 3:5

> Does a bird fall into a snare on the ground when there is no bait for it?
> Does a trap spring up from the ground when it has caught nothing?

## Amos 3:6

> If a trumpet is sounded in a city, do not the people tremble?
> If calamity befalls a city, has not the Lord caused it?

## Amos 3:7

> Surely the Lord God does nothing
> without revealing His secret plan
> to His servants the prophets.

## Amos 3:8

> The lion has roared—who will not fear?
> The Lord God has spoken—who can but prophesy?

## Amos 3:9

> Proclaim to the strongholds in Ashdod and to the strongholds in the land of Egypt:
> “Assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria
> and behold the great turmoil within her
> and the oppression in her midst.”

## Amos 3:10

> “They do not know how to do what is right,” declares the Lord,
> “those who store up violence and devastation in their strongholds.”

## Amos 3:11

Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says:

> “An adversary shall surround the land
> and bring down your defences,
> and your strongholds shall be plundered.”

## Amos 3:12

This is what the Lord says:

> “As a shepherd rescues from the lion’s mouth
> two legs or a piece of an ear,
> so shall the Israelites in Samaria be rescued,
> with only the corner of a bed and a piece of fabric from a couch.”

## Amos 3:13

> “Listen and bear witness against the house of Jacob,”
> says the Lord God, the God of hosts.

## Amos 3:14

> “For on the day I punish Israel for her transgressions,
> I will also destroy the altars of Bethel;
> the horns of the altar shall be cut off
> and fall to the ground.

## Amos 3:15

> I will demolish the winter house along with the summer house;
> the houses adorned with ivory shall perish,
> and the great houses shall come to an end,”

declares the Lord.
