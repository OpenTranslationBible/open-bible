# Amos Chapter 7

## Amos 7:1

This is what the Lord God showed me: He was forming a swarm of locusts just after the king’s harvest and as the late crops were sprouting.

## Amos 7:2

When they had consumed the vegetation of the land, I pleaded, “Lord God, forgive! How can Jacob endure? He is so small!”

## Amos 7:3

The Lord changed His mind about this. “It shall not happen,” said the Lord.

## Amos 7:4

This is what the Lord God showed me: He was calling for judgment by fire, which dried up the great deep and began to devour the land.

## Amos 7:5

Then I implored, “Lord God, cease! How can Jacob endure? He is so small!”

## Amos 7:6

The Lord changed His mind about this. “This too shall not happen,” said the Lord God.

## Amos 7:7

This is what He showed me: The Lord was standing by a wall built true to plumb, with a plumb line in His hand.

## Amos 7:8

And the Lord asked me, “What do you see, Amos?” I replied, “A plumb line.” Then the Lord said, “Behold, I am setting a plumb line among My people Israel; I will spare them no longer.

## Amos 7:9

> The high places of Isaac will be laid waste,
> and the sanctuaries of Israel will be ruined;
> I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.”

## Amos 7:10

Then Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, sent a message to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, “Amos is conspiring against you in the heart of Israel. The land cannot bear all his words.

## Amos 7:11

For this is what Amos says:

> ‘Jeroboam will die by the sword,
> and Israel will surely go into exile, away from their land.’”

## Amos 7:12

Then Amaziah said to Amos, “Go away, seer! Flee to the land of Judah; earn your bread there and do your prophesying there.

## Amos 7:13

But refrain from prophesying any longer at Bethel, for it is the king’s sanctuary and a royal temple.”

## Amos 7:14

Amos replied to Amaziah, “I was not a prophet nor the son of a prophet, but a herdsman and a dresser of sycamore figs.

## Amos 7:15

However, the Lord called me away from tending the flock and instructed me, ‘Go, prophesy to My people Israel.’

## Amos 7:16

Now then, hear the word of the Lord.

> You say, ‘Do not prophesy against Israel,
> and do not preach against the house of Isaac.’

## Amos 7:17

Therefore this is what the Lord says:

> ‘Your wife will become a prostitute in the city,
> your sons and daughters will fall by the sword,
> your land will be divided up with a measuring line,
> and you yourself will die on unclean soil.
> And Israel will surely go into exile, away from its land.’”
