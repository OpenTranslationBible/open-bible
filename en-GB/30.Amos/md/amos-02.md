# Amos Chapter 2

## Amos 2:1

This is what the Lord says:

> “For three offences of Moab, and for four,  
> I will not revoke its punishment,  
> Because he burned the bones of the king of Edom to lime.

## Amos 2:2

> So I will send fire upon Moab,  
> And it will consume the citadels of Kerioth;  
> And Moab will die amid the panic,  
> With war cries and the sound of a trumpet.

## Amos 2:3

> I will remove the judge from among them  
> And put an end to all her leaders with him,”  
> Says the Lord.

## Amos 2:4

This is what the Lord says:

> “For three offences of Judah, and for four,  
> I will not revoke its punishment,  
> Because they rejected the Law of the Lord,  
> And have not kept His statutes;  
> Their lies also have led them astray,  
> Those which their fathers followed.

## Amos 2:5

> Therefore, I will send fire upon Judah,  
> And it will devour the fortresses of Jerusalem.”

## Amos 2:6

This is what the Lord says:

> “For three offences of Israel, and for four,  
> I will not revoke its punishment,  
> Because they sell the righteous for money,  
> And the needy for a pair of sandals.

## Amos 2:7

> These who trample the head of the poor  
> Into the dust of the earth  
> And push the afflicted out of the way;  
> A man and his father have sexual relations with the same girl,  
> So that My holy name is profaned.

## Amos 2:8

> And on garments taken as security they recline beside every altar,  
> And in the house of their God they drink the wine of those who have been penalised.

## Amos 2:9

> Yet it was I who removed the Amorite before them,  
> Though his stature was like that of cedars,  
> And he was as strong as the oaks;  
> I also destroyed his fruit above and his roots below.

## Amos 2:10

> And it was I who brought you up from the land of Egypt,  
> And guided you in the wilderness for forty years,  
> So that you might take possession of the land of the Amorite.

## Amos 2:11

> Then I appointed some of your sons to be prophets,  
> And some of your young men to be Nazirites.  
> Is this not so, you sons of Israel?”  
> Declares the Lord.

## Amos 2:12

> “But you caused the Nazirites to drink wine,  
> And you commanded the prophets, saying,  
> ‘You shall not prophesy!’

## Amos 2:13

> Behold, I am pressing down upon you,  
> Just as a wagon is pressed down when filled with sheaves.

## Amos 2:14

> Escape will fail the swift,  
> And the strong will not strengthen his power,  
> Nor the warrior save his life.

## Amos 2:15

> The archer will not stand firm,  
> The swift of foot will not escape,  
> Nor will the horseman save his life.

## Amos 2:16

> Even the most courageous among the warriors will flee unclothed on that day,”  
> Declares the Lord.
