# Amos Chapter 9

## Amos 9:1

I saw the Lord standing beside the altar, and He said,

> “Strike the pillar capitals so that the thresholds will shake,  
> And break them on the heads of them all!  
> Then I will put the rest of them to the sword;  
> They will not have a fugitive who will flee,  
> Nor a survivor who will escape.

## Amos 9:2

> Though they dig into Sheol,  
> From there My hand will take them;  
> And though they climb up to heaven,  
> From there I will bring them down.

## Amos 9:3

> Though they hide on the summit of Carmel,  
> I will track them down and take them from there;  
> And though they hide from My sight on the bottom of the sea,  
> I will command the serpent from there, and it will bite them.

## Amos 9:4

> Even if they are led into captivity by their enemies,  
> From there I will command the sword to bring about their end,  
> And I will set My eyes against them for adversity and not for good.”

## Amos 9:5

> And the Lord God of armies,  
> The One who touches the land so that it quakes,  
> And all those who live in it mourn,  
> And all of it rises up like the Nile  
> And subsides like the Nile of Egypt;

## Amos 9:6

> The One who makes His upper chambers in the heavens  
> And establishes His arch over the earth,  
> He who summons the waters of the sea  
> And pours them out upon the surface of the earth,  
> The Lord is His name.

## Amos 9:7

> “Are you not as the sons of Ethiopia to Me,  
> You sons of Israel?” declares the Lord.  
> “Have I not brought Israel up from the land of Egypt,  
> And the Philistines from Caphtor and the Arameans from Kir?

## Amos 9:8

> Behold, the eyes of the Lord God are on the sinful kingdom,  
> And I will eliminate it from the face of the earth;  
> Nevertheless, I will not totally destroy the house of Jacob,”  
> Declares the Lord.

## Amos 9:9

> “For behold, I am commanding,  
> And I will shake the house of Israel among all the nations  
> As grain is shaken in a sieve,  
> But not a pebble will fall to the ground.

## Amos 9:10

> All the sinners among My people will perish by the sword,  
> Those who say, ‘The disaster will not overtake nor confront us.’

## Amos 9:11

In that day, I will restore the fallen shelter of David,

> And repair its breaches;  
> I will also restore its ruins  
> And rebuild it as in the days of old;

## Amos 9:12

> So that they may inherit the remnant of Edom  
> And all the nations who bear My name,”  
> Declares the Lord who accomplishes this.

## Amos 9:13

“Behold, days are coming,” declares the Lord,

> “When the ploughman will overtake the reaper,  
> And the one who treads grapes will overtake the one who sows the seed;  
> When the mountains will drip with sweet wine,  
> And all the hills will come apart.

## Amos 9:14

> I will also bring back the fortunes of My people Israel,  
> And they will rebuild the desolated cities and inhabit them;  
> They will also plant vineyards and drink their wine,  
> And make gardens and eat their fruit.

## Amos 9:15

> I will also establish them in their land,  
> And they shall not be removed again from the land  
> Which I have given them,”

Says the Lord your God.
