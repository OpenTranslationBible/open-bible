# 1 Samuel Chapter 14

## 1 Samuel 14:1

Now it came to pass one day that Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who carried his armour, “Come, let us go over to the Philistine garrison on the other side.” But he did not tell his father.

## 1 Samuel 14:2

Saul was staying in the outskirts of Gibeah under the pomegranate tree in Migron. The people with him were about six hundred men,

## 1 Samuel 14:3

And Ahijah the son of Ahitub, Ichabod’s brother, son of Phinehas, son of Eli, the priest of the Lord in Shiloh, was wearing the ephod. But the people did not know that Jonathan had gone.

## 1 Samuel 14:4

Now between the passes by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistine garrison, there was a sharp crag on one side and a sharp crag on the other side; one was called Bozez, and the other Seneh.

## 1 Samuel 14:5

One crag rose on the north facing Michmash, and the other on the south facing Geba.

## 1 Samuel 14:6

And Jonathan said to the young man who carried his armour, “Come, let us cross over to the garrison of these uncircumcised men. It may be that the Lord will act for us, for nothing can hinder the Lord from saving, whether by many or by few.”

## 1 Samuel 14:7

And his armour-bearer said to him, “Do all that is in your heart. Go ahead; I am with you heart and soul.”

## 1 Samuel 14:8

Then Jonathan said, “Now we will cross over to the men and show ourselves to them.

## 1 Samuel 14:9

If they say to us, ‘Wait until we come to you,’ then we will remain where we are and not go up to them.

## 1 Samuel 14:10

But if they say, ‘Come up to us,’ then we will go up, for the Lord has given them into our hand. This shall be the sign to us.”

## 1 Samuel 14:11

When both of them revealed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines, the Philistines said, “Behold, the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have hidden themselves.”

## 1 Samuel 14:12

And the men of the garrison hailed Jonathan and his armour-bearer and said, “Come up to us, and we will show you something.”  
Jonathan said to his armour-bearer, “Come up after me, for the Lord has given them into the hand of Israel.”

## 1 Samuel 14:13

Then Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, and his armour-bearer after him. And they fell before Jonathan, and his armour-bearer killed them after him.

## 1 Samuel 14:14

In that first attack, Jonathan and his armour-bearer killed about twenty men within about half a furlong of land.

## 1 Samuel 14:15

And there was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people. The garrison and even the raiders trembled, and the earth quaked, and it became a great panic from God.

---

## 1 Samuel 14:16

Saul’s watchmen in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and behold, the multitude melted away and scattered in every direction.

## 1 Samuel 14:17

Then Saul said to the people who were with him, “Call the roll and see who has gone from us.” And when they had called the roll, behold, Jonathan and his armour-bearer were not there.

## 1 Samuel 14:18

So Saul said to Ahijah, “Bring the ark of God here.” For the ark of God was at that time with the sons of Israel.

## 1 Samuel 14:19

And while Saul was speaking to the priest, the tumult in the camp of the Philistines continued to increase. Then Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand.”

## 1 Samuel 14:20

Then Saul and all the people who were with him assembled and went into the battle; and behold, every man’s sword was against his fellow, and there was great confusion.

## 1 Samuel 14:21

Now the Hebrews who had previously been with the Philistines and had gone up with them into the camp from the surrounding country, even they joined with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.

## 1 Samuel 14:22

And all the men of Israel who had hidden in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were fleeing, and they also followed hard after them in the battle.

## 1 Samuel 14:23

Thus the Lord delivered Israel that day, and the battle moved beyond Beth-aven.

---

## 1 Samuel 14:24

Now the men of Israel were hard pressed that day, for Saul had laid an oath on the people, saying, “Cursed is the man who eats food before evening, before I have taken vengeance on my enemies.” So none of the people tasted food.

## 1 Samuel 14:25

Then all the people of the land entered the forest, and there was honey on the ground.

## 1 Samuel 14:26

And when the people entered the forest, behold, the honey was dripping, but no one put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath.

## 1 Samuel 14:27

But Jonathan had not heard his father charge the people with the oath; so he reached out the end of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth, and his eyes brightened.

## 1 Samuel 14:28

Then one of the people said, “Your father strictly charged the people with an oath, saying, ‘Cursed is the man who eats food today.’” And the people were faint.

## 1 Samuel 14:29

Then Jonathan remarked, “My father has brought trouble to the land. See how my eyes have brightened because I tasted a little of this honey.

## 1 Samuel 14:30

How much better it would have been if the people had eaten freely today from the spoil of their enemies which they found! For now the slaughter among the Philistines has not been significant.”

---

## 1 Samuel 14:31

That day, they defeated the Philistines from Michmash to Aijalon, and the people were exceedingly weary.

## 1 Samuel 14:32

The people rushed greedily upon the spoil and took sheep, oxen, and calves, and slaughtered them on the ground; and the people ate them with the blood.

## 1 Samuel 14:33

Then it was told Saul, saying, “Behold, the people are sinning against the Lord by eating meat with the blood.”  
And he said, “You have dealt treacherously; roll a large stone to me here.”

## 1 Samuel 14:34

Then Saul said, “Disperse yourselves among the people and tell them, ‘Each one bring his ox or sheep, and slaughter it here and eat, and do not sin against the Lord by eating with the blood.’” So all the people brought their oxen that night and slaughtered them there.

## 1 Samuel 14:35

And Saul built an altar to the Lord—it was the first altar that he built to the Lord.

---

## 1 Samuel 14:36

Then Saul said, “Let us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder them until morning light, and let us not leave a man of them.” And they said, “Do whatever seems good to you.” But the priest said, “Let us draw near to God here.”

## 1 Samuel 14:37

And Saul inquired of God, “Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will You deliver them into the hand of Israel?” But He did not answer him that day.

## 1 Samuel 14:38

So Saul said, “Come here, all you chiefs of the people, and know and see wherein this sin has been today.

## 1 Samuel 14:39

For as the Lord lives, who saves Israel, even if it is Jonathan my son, he shall surely die.” But not one of all the people answered him.

## 1 Samuel 14:40

Then he addressed all Israel, “You shall be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side.” And the people said to Saul, “Do what seems good to you.”

## 1 Samuel 14:41

Therefore Saul said to the Lord, “O God of Israel, give a perfect lot.” And Jonathan and Saul were taken, but the people escaped.

## 1 Samuel 14:42

Then Saul said, “Cast the lot between me and Jonathan my son.” And Jonathan was taken.

## 1 Samuel 14:43

Then Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done.”  
And Jonathan told him, “I indeed tasted a little honey with the end of the staff that was in my hand. Here I am; I must die.”

## 1 Samuel 14:44

And Saul said, “God do so to me and more also, for you shall surely die, Jonathan.”

## 1 Samuel 14:45

But the people said to Saul, “Shall Jonathan die, who has brought about this great deliverance in Israel? Far from it! As the Lord lives, not a hair of his head shall fall to the ground, for he has worked with God today.” So the people rescued Jonathan, and he did not die.

## 1 Samuel 14:46

Then Saul ceased pursuing the Philistines, and the Philistines returned to their own place.

---

## 1 Samuel 14:47

Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side—against Moab, the Ammonites, Edom, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. And wherever he turned, he routed them.

## 1 Samuel 14:48

He acted valiantly and struck the Amalekites, and delivered Israel from the hands of those who plundered them.

## 1 Samuel 14:49

Saul's sons were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchi-shua. His two daughters were named Merab, the firstborn, and Michal, the younger.

## 1 Samuel 14:50

Ahinoam, daughter of Ahimaaz, was Saul’s wife. The commander of his army was Abner, son of Ner, who was Saul’s uncle.

## 1 Samuel 14:51

Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.

## 1 Samuel 14:52

There was hard fighting against the Philistines all the days of Saul. And whenever Saul saw any mighty man or valiant man, he took him into his service.
