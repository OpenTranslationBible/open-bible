## 1 Samuel 12:3

Here I am. Testify against me before the Lord and before His anointed: Whose ox have I taken? Or whose donkey have I taken? Whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed? From whose hand have I taken a bribe to blind my eyes with it? Testify against me, and I will restore it to you.”

Then Samuel said to the people, “It is the Lord who appointed Moses and Aaron and brought your fathers up from the land of Egypt.

Now therefore stand still, that I may plead with you before the Lord concerning all the righteous deeds of the Lord, which He did for you and your fathers.

But they forgot the Lord their God, and so He allowed them to fall into the hand of Sisera, commander of the army of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.

## 1 Samuel 12:10

Then they cried out to the Lord and said, ‘We have sinned, because we have forsaken the Lord and have served the Baals and the Ashtoreths; but now deliver us from the hand of our enemies, and we will serve You.’

But when you saw that Nahash the king of the Ammonites came against you, you said to me, ‘No, but a king shall reign over us’—when the Lord your God was your king.

## 1 Samuel 12:13

Now therefore behold the king whom you have chosen, for whom you have asked; and behold, the Lord has set a king over you.

## 1 Samuel 12:14

If you will fear the Lord and serve Him, and obey His voice and not rebel against the command of the Lord, and if both you and the king who reigns over you follow the Lord your God, it will be well.

## 1 Samuel 12:15

But if you will not obey the voice of the Lord, and rebel against the command of the Lord, then the hand of the Lord will be against you and against your king.

Now therefore stand still and observe this great thing, which the Lord will perform before your eyes.

## 1 Samuel 12:17

And all the people said to Samuel, “Pray for your servants to the Lord your God, that we do not die; for we have added to all our sins this evil, to ask for ourselves a king.”

## 1 Samuel 12:20

Then Samuel said to the people, “Do not fear. You have done all this evil, yet do not turn aside from following the Lord, but serve the Lord with all your heart.

## 1 Samuel 12:21

And do not turn aside to go after futile things which cannot profit or deliver, for they are nothing.

## 1 Samuel 12:22

For the Lord will not abandon His people for His great name’s sake, because it has pleased the Lord to make you His people.

## 1 Samuel 12:23

As for me, I would never sin against the Lord by ceasing to pray for you; instead, I will guide you in the good and right way.

## 1 Samuel 12:24

Fear the Lord and serve Him faithfully with all your heart; for consider what great things He has done for you.

## 1 Samuel 12:25

But if you still do wickedly, you shall be swept away, both you and your king.
