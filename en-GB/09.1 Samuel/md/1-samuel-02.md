# 1 Samuel Chapter 2

## 1 Samuel 2:1

Then Hannah prayed and said:

> “My heart rejoices in the Lord;  
> My horn is lifted high by the Lord.  
> My mouth boasts over my enemies,  
> For I rejoice in Your deliverance.

## 1 Samuel 2:2

> There is none holy like the Lord,  
> For there is no one besides You,  
> Nor is there any rock like our God.

## 1 Samuel 2:3

> Do not speak so proudly,  
> Let not arrogance come from your mouth,  
> For the Lord is a God of knowledge,  
> And by Him actions are weighed.

## 1 Samuel 2:4

> The bows of the mighty are broken,  
> But those who stumbled are now armed with strength.

## 1 Samuel 2:5

> Those who were full hire themselves out for bread,  
> But those who were hungry are now satisfied.  
> Even the barren has borne seven,  
> But she who had many sons languishes.

## 1 Samuel 2:6

> The Lord brings death and gives life;  
> He brings down to the grave and raises up.

## 1 Samuel 2:7

> The Lord makes poor and makes rich;  
> He brings low and He lifts up.

## 1 Samuel 2:8

> He raises the poor from the dust,  
> He lifts the needy from the ash heap  
> To make them sit with princes  
> And inherit a seat of honour.  
> For the foundations of the earth belong to the Lord,  
> And upon them He has set the world.

## 1 Samuel 2:9

> He guards the feet of His faithful ones,  
> But the wicked shall be silenced in darkness,  
> For not by strength shall a person prevail.

## 1 Samuel 2:10

> Those who oppose the Lord will be shattered;  
> He will thunder against them from the heavens.  
> The Lord will judge the ends of the earth.  
> He will give strength to His king  
> And exalt the horn of His anointed.”

## 1 Samuel 2:11

Then Elkanah went back to his home at Ramah, but the boy remained to serve the Lord under Eli the priest.

## 1 Samuel 2:12

Now the sons of Eli were wicked men; they had no regard for the Lord.

## 1 Samuel 2:13

The custom of the priests with the people was that when anyone brought a sacrifice, the priest’s servant would come with a three-pronged fork while the meat was boiling,

## 1 Samuel 2:14

And he would plunge it into the pan or pot or kettle or cauldron. Whatever the fork brought up, the priest would take for himself. This is how they treated all the Israelites who came to Shiloh.

## 1 Samuel 2:15

Even before the fat was burned, the servant of the priest would come and say to the person offering the sacrifice, “Give the priest meat to roast. He won’t accept boiled meat from you—only raw.”

## 1 Samuel 2:16

If the man said to him, “Let the fat be burned first, and then you may take as much as you wish,” he would answer, “No, hand it over now. If not, I will take it by force.”

## 1 Samuel 2:17

So the sin of the young men was very great before the Lord, because they treated the Lord’s offering with contempt.

---

## 1 Samuel 2:18

But Samuel ministered before the Lord—a boy wearing a linen ephod.

## 1 Samuel 2:19

Each year his mother made him a little robe and brought it to him when she went up with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice.

## 1 Samuel 2:20

Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, saying, “May the Lord give you children from this woman in place of the one she dedicated to the Lord.” Then they would return home.

## 1 Samuel 2:21

And the Lord visited Hannah, and she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile, the boy Samuel grew up in the presence of the Lord.

---

## 1 Samuel 2:22

Now Eli was very old, and he heard about all that his sons were doing to all Israel—how they slept with the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting.

## 1 Samuel 2:23

So he said to them, “Why do you do such things? For I keep hearing about your wicked deeds from all the people.

## 1 Samuel 2:24

No, my sons; the report I hear spreading among the Lord’s people is not good.

## 1 Samuel 2:25

If a man sins against another, God may mediate for him; but if someone sins against the Lord, who can intercede?” But they did not listen to their father, for it was the Lord’s will to put them to death.

---

## 1 Samuel 2:26

And the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favour with both the Lord and with people.

---

## 1 Samuel 2:27

A man of God came to Eli and said to him, “This is what the Lord says: Did I not plainly reveal Myself to your ancestor’s house when they were in Egypt, under Pharaoh’s rule?

## 1 Samuel 2:28

I chose your ancestor out of all the tribes of Israel to be My priest, to offer sacrifices on My altar, to burn incense, and to wear an ephod in My presence. I also gave your family all the food offerings made by fire from the Israelites.

## 1 Samuel 2:29

Why then do you show contempt for My sacrifice and offering that I commanded in My dwelling place? Why do you honour your sons more than Me, by fattening yourselves on the choicest parts of every offering made by My people Israel?”

## 1 Samuel 2:30

“Therefore the Lord, the God of Israel, declares: I promised that your family and the family of your ancestor would minister before Me forever. But now,” declares the Lord, “far be it from Me! For those who honour Me I will honour, but those who despise Me shall be treated with contempt.

## 1 Samuel 2:31

The time is coming when I will cut off your strength and the strength of your family, so that no one in your house will reach old age.

## 1 Samuel 2:32

You will see distress in My dwelling, though good will be done to Israel, and there will never be an old man in your family line.

## 1 Samuel 2:33

Every one of you that I do not cut off from My altar will be spared only to bring grief to your eyes and sorrow to your heart, and all your descendants will die in the prime of life.

## 1 Samuel 2:34

And this sign will come to you concerning your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas: they will both die on the same day.

## 1 Samuel 2:35

Then I will raise up for Myself a faithful priest, who will do what is in My heart and mind. I will establish his house, and he will minister before My anointed one always.

## 1 Samuel 2:36

Then everyone left in your family will come and bow down before him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, saying, ‘Please appoint me to some priestly office so I may have food to eat.’”
