# 1 Samuel Chapter 21

## 1 Samuel 21:1

Then David came to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest.  
And Ahimelech came trembling to meet David and said to him, “Why are you alone, and no one with you?”

## 1 Samuel 21:2

David said to Ahimelech the priest, “The king has commissioned me with a matter and said to me, ‘Let no one know anything about the matter on which I am sending you, and with which I have commissioned you.’  
And I have directed the young men to a certain place.

## 1 Samuel 21:3

So, what provisions do you have available? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever can be found.”

## 1 Samuel 21:4

The priest answered David and said, “There is no ordinary bread on hand, but there is consecrated bread—provided the men have kept themselves from women.”

## 1 Samuel 21:5

David answered the priest and said to him, “Indeed, women have been kept from us as always when I go out.  
The vessels of the young men were holy, though it was an ordinary journey; how much more then today will their vessels be holy?”

## 1 Samuel 21:6

So the priest gave him the consecrated bread, for there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence,  
which was removed from before the Lord in order to put hot bread in its place when it was taken away.

## 1 Samuel 21:7

Now one of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the Lord.  
His name was Doeg the Edomite, the chief of Saul’s shepherds.

## 1 Samuel 21:8

David said to Ahimelech, “Now is there no spear or sword on hand?  
For I brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king’s matter was urgent.”

## 1 Samuel 21:9

Then the priest said, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, behold, it is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod.  
If you would take it for yourself, take it, for there is no other except it here.”  
And David said, “There is none like it; give it to me.”

## 1 Samuel 21:10

Then David got up and escaped that day from Saul, and went to Achish king of Gath.

## 1 Samuel 21:11

But the servants of Achish said to him,  
“Is this not David the king of the land? Did they not sing of him as they danced, saying,

> ‘Saul has slain his thousands,  
> And David his tens of thousands’?”

## 1 Samuel 21:12

David pondered these words and became very afraid of Achish king of Gath.

## 1 Samuel 21:13

So he disguised his behaviour before them, and pretended to be insane in their hands,  
and scribbled on the doors of the gate, and let his saliva run down into his beard.

## 1 Samuel 21:14

Then Achish said to his servants,  
“Look, you see the man is insane. Why do you bring him to me?

## 1 Samuel 21:15

Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this one to behave like a madman in my presence?  
Shall this man come into my house?”
