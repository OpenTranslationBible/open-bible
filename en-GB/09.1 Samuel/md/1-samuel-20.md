# 1 Samuel Chapter 20

## 1 Samuel 20:1

Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said to Jonathan,  
“What have I done? What is my guilt? What is my sin before your father, that he is seeking my life?”

## 1 Samuel 20:2

But he said to him, “Far from it! You shall not die. Behold, my father does nothing either great or small without telling me.  
Why would my father hide this matter from me? It is not so!”

## 1 Samuel 20:3

Yet David vowed again and said, “Your father knows well that I have found favour in your sight, and he has said,  
‘Jonathan must not know this, so that he does not grieve.’  
But truly, as the Lord lives and as you yourself live, there is hardly a step between me and death.”

## 1 Samuel 20:4

Then Jonathan said to David, “Whatever you say, I will do for you.”

## 1 Samuel 20:5

David said to Jonathan, “Behold, tomorrow is the New Moon, and I am expected to sit with the king to eat.  
But let me go, so that I may hide myself in the field until the third evening.

## 1 Samuel 20:6

If your father misses me at all, then say, ‘David earnestly requested permission of me to run to Bethlehem, his city,  
because it is the yearly sacrifice there for the whole family.’

## 1 Samuel 20:7

If he says, ‘It is good,’ your servant will be safe;  
but if he becomes angry, know that he has decided to harm me.

## 1 Samuel 20:8

Therefore deal kindly with your servant, for you have brought your servant into a covenant of the Lord with you.  
But if there is guilt in me, put me to death yourself; for why should you bring me to your father?”

## 1 Samuel 20:9

Jonathan said, “Far be it from you! For if I indeed learn that my father has decided to harm you, would I not inform you?”

## 1 Samuel 20:10

Then David asked Jonathan, “How will I know if your father responds to you harshly?”

## 1 Samuel 20:11

Jonathan said to David, “Come, let us go out into the field.”  
So the two of them went out to the field.

## 1 Samuel 20:12

Then Jonathan said to David, “The Lord, the God of Israel, be witness!  
When I have sounded out my father about this time tomorrow or the third day,  
if all is well with David, shall I not then send word to you and disclose it to you?

## 1 Samuel 20:13

But if it pleases my father to do you harm, may the Lord deal harshly with me, Jonathan, and worse,  
if I do not inform you and send you away, so that you may go in safety.  
And may the Lord be with you as He has been with my father.

## 1 Samuel 20:14

If I am still alive, will you not show me the lovingkindness of the Lord, so that I do not die?

## 1 Samuel 20:15

And you shall not cut off your loyalty from my house forever,  
not even when the Lord eliminates every one of the enemies of David from the face of the earth.”

## 1 Samuel 20:16

So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, “May the Lord call David’s enemies to account.”

## 1 Samuel 20:17

Jonathan made David vow again because of his love for him,  
for he loved him as he loved his own life.

---

## 1 Samuel 20:18

Then Jonathan said to him, “Tomorrow is the New Moon, and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty.

## 1 Samuel 20:19

When you have stayed for three days, you shall go down quickly and come to the place where you hid yourself on that eventful day,  
and you shall stay beside the stone Ezel.

## 1 Samuel 20:20

And I will shoot three arrows to the side, as if aiming at a target.

## 1 Samuel 20:21

Then behold, I will send the boy and say, ‘Go, find the arrows.’  
If I specifically say to the boy, ‘Behold, the arrows are on this side of you; get them,’  
then come out, for there is safety for you and no harm, as the Lord lives.

## 1 Samuel 20:22

But if I say to the youth, ‘Behold, the arrows are beyond you,’ then go, for the Lord has sent you away.

## 1 Samuel 20:23

As for the matter which you and I have spoken of, behold, the Lord is between you and me forever.”

---

## 1 Samuel 20:24

So David hid in the field; and when the New Moon came, the king sat down to eat the meal.

## 1 Samuel 20:25

The king sat on his seat as usual, the seat by the wall;  
then Jonathan got up and Abner sat down by Saul’s side, but David’s place was empty.

## 1 Samuel 20:26

Nevertheless Saul did not say anything that day, for he thought,  
“It must be an accident; he is not ceremonially clean; surely he is not clean.”

## 1 Samuel 20:27

And it came about the next day, the second day of the New Moon, that David’s place was empty.  
So Saul said to Jonathan his son, “Why has the son of Jesse not come to the meal, either yesterday or today?”

## 1 Samuel 20:28

Jonathan answered Saul, “David earnestly requested permission from me to go to Bethlehem.

## 1 Samuel 20:29

He said, ‘Please let me go, since our family has a sacrifice in the city, and my brother has commanded me to attend.  
Now if I have found favour in your sight, please let me slip away so that I may see my brothers.’  
For that reason he has not come to the king’s table.”

---

## 1 Samuel 20:30

Then Saul’s anger burned against Jonathan and he said to him,  
“You son of a perverse, rebellious woman!  
Do I not know that you are choosing the son of Jesse to your own shame and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness?

## 1 Samuel 20:31

For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, you and your kingdom will not be established.  
Now then, send someone and bring him to me, for he is doomed to die!”

## 1 Samuel 20:32

But Jonathan replied to his father Saul and asked, “Why should he be put to death? What has he done?”

## 1 Samuel 20:33

Then Saul hurled his spear at him to strike him down; so Jonathan knew that his father was determined to put David to death.

## 1 Samuel 20:34

So Jonathan got up from the table in burning anger, and did not eat food on the second day of the new moon,  
for he was grieved over David because his father had dishonoured him.

---

## 1 Samuel 20:35

Now it came about in the morning that Jonathan went out to the field for the meeting with David,  
and a little boy was with him.

## 1 Samuel 20:36

And he said to his boy, “Run, find now the arrows which I am going to shoot.”  
As the boy ran, he shot an arrow past him.

## 1 Samuel 20:37

When the boy reached the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot,  
Jonathan called after the boy and said, “Is the arrow not beyond you?”

## 1 Samuel 20:38

And Jonathan called after the boy, “Hurry, be quick, do not stay!”  
And Jonathan’s boy picked up the arrow and came to his master.

## 1 Samuel 20:39

But the boy was unaware of anything; only Jonathan and David understood the matter.

## 1 Samuel 20:40

Then Jonathan handed his weapons to his boy and instructed him, “Go, take them to the city.”

## 1 Samuel 20:41

When the boy had gone, David got up from the south side and fell on his face to the ground,  
and bowed three times. And they kissed each other and wept together, but David wept more.

## 1 Samuel 20:42

Jonathan said to David, “Go in safety, since we have sworn in the name of the Lord, saying,  
‘The Lord will be between me and you, and between my descendants and your descendants forever.’”  
So David set out and Jonathan went into the city.
