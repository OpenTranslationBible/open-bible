# 1 Samuel Chapter 7

## 1 Samuel 7:1

So the men of Kiriath-jearim came and took up the ark of the Lord. They brought it to the house of Abinadab on the hill and consecrated his son Eleazar to guard the ark of the Lord.

## 1 Samuel 7:2

The ark remained at Kiriath-jearim a long time—twenty years in all. Then the whole house of Israel turned back to the Lord with sorrow.

## 1 Samuel 7:3

Samuel said to all the people of Israel, “If you are truly returning to the Lord with all your hearts, then remove the foreign gods and the Ashtoreths from among you. Commit yourselves to the Lord and serve Him only, and He will deliver you from the hand of the Philistines.”

## 1 Samuel 7:4

So the Israelites removed the Baals and the Ashtoreths and served the Lord alone.

## 1 Samuel 7:5

Then Samuel said, “Assemble all Israel at Mizpah, and I will pray to the Lord on your behalf.”

## 1 Samuel 7:6

When they had gathered at Mizpah, they drew water and poured it out before the Lord. On that day they fasted, and they confessed, “We have sinned against the Lord.”  
And Samuel was serving as judge over the Israelites at Mizpah.

## 1 Samuel 7:7

When the Philistines heard that Israel had assembled at Mizpah, their rulers went up to attack them. When the Israelites heard this, they were afraid of the Philistines.

## 1 Samuel 7:8

They said to Samuel, “Do not stop crying out to the Lord our God for us, so that He may rescue us from the Philistines.”

## 1 Samuel 7:9

Then Samuel took a suckling lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the Lord. He cried out to the Lord on Israel’s behalf, and the Lord answered him.

## 1 Samuel 7:10

As Samuel was offering the burnt sacrifice, the Philistines drew near to engage Israel in battle. But that day the Lord thundered with a loud voice against the Philistines and threw them into such confusion that they were routed before Israel.

## 1 Samuel 7:11

The men of Israel rushed out from Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, striking them down along the way to a point below Beth-car.

## 1 Samuel 7:12

Samuel then set up a stone between Mizpah and Shen, calling it Ebenezer, and declared, “Up to this point, the Lord has aided us.”

## 1 Samuel 7:13

So the Philistines were subdued and did not invade Israelite territory again. The Lord’s hand was against the Philistines throughout Samuel’s lifetime.

## 1 Samuel 7:14

The towns the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored, from Ekron to Gath, and Israel recovered the surrounding territory from the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.

## 1 Samuel 7:15

Samuel continued to serve as judge over Israel for the rest of his life.

## 1 Samuel 7:16

Each year he travelled on a circuit from Bethel to Gilgal to Mizpah, judging Israel in all those places.

## 1 Samuel 7:17

But he always returned to Ramah, where his home was, and there he also judged Israel. And he built an altar there to the Lord.
