# 1 Samuel Chapter 22

## 1 Samuel 22:1

So David departed from there and escaped to the cave of Adullam.  
And when his brothers and all his father’s household heard about it, they went down there to him.

## 1 Samuel 22:2

Everyone who was in distress, everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was discontented gathered to him;  
and he became captain over them. Now there were about four hundred men with him.

## 1 Samuel 22:3

And David went from there to Mizpah of Moab.  
He said to the king of Moab, “Please let my father and my mother come and stay with you  
until I know what God will do for me.”

## 1 Samuel 22:4

He entrusted them to the king of Moab; and they remained with him for as long as David was in the stronghold.

## 1 Samuel 22:5

But the prophet Gad said to David, “Do not stay in the stronghold; leave and go into the land of Judah.”  
So David left and went to the forest of Hereth.

## 1 Samuel 22:6

Then Saul heard that David and the men who were with him had been discovered.  
Now Saul was sitting in Gibeah, under the tamarisk tree on the hill, with his spear in his hand,  
and all his servants were standing around him.

## 1 Samuel 22:7

Saul said to his servants who stood around him,  
“Hear now, you Benjaminites! Will the son of Jesse also give all of you fields and vineyards?  
Will he make you all commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds?

## 1 Samuel 22:8

For all of you have conspired against me,  
so that no one informs me when my son makes a covenant with the son of Jesse,  
and none of you is concerned for me or informs me that my son has stirred up my servant against me,  
to lie in ambush, as it is this day.”

## 1 Samuel 22:9

Then Doeg the Edomite, who was standing by the servants of Saul, said,  
“I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.

## 1 Samuel 22:10

And he inquired of the Lord for him, gave him provisions,  
and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.”

## 1 Samuel 22:11

Then the king sent someone to summon Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father’s household,  
the priests who were in Nob; and all of them came to the king.

## 1 Samuel 22:12

Saul said, “Listen now, son of Ahitub.”  
And he said, “Here I am, my lord.”

## 1 Samuel 22:13

Then Saul said to him,  
“Why have you and the son of Jesse conspired against me,  
by giving him bread and a sword, and by inquiring of God for him,  
so that he would rise up against me, by lying in ambush, as it is this day?”

## 1 Samuel 22:14

Ahimelech answered the king and said,  
“And who among all your servants is as faithful as David,  
the king’s son-in-law, captain over your guard, and honoured in your house?

## 1 Samuel 22:15

Did I just begin to inquire of God for him today? Far be it from me!  
Do not let the king impute anything to his servant or to any of the household of my father,  
for your servant knows nothing at all of this whole affair.”

## 1 Samuel 22:16

But the king declared, “Ahimelech, you and all your father’s household shall surely die!”

## 1 Samuel 22:17

And the king said to the guards who were attending him,  
“Turn around and put the priests of the Lord to death,  
because their hand also is with David, and because they knew that he was fleeing and did not inform me.”  
But the servants of the king were not willing to reach out with their hands to attack the priests of the Lord.

## 1 Samuel 22:18

Then the king said to Doeg, “You turn around and attack the priests!”  
So Doeg the Edomite turned around and attacked the priests,  
and he killed on that day eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod.

## 1 Samuel 22:19

He also struck Nob the city of the priests with the edge of the sword,  
both men and women, children and infants; also oxen, donkeys, and sheep he struck with the edge of the sword.

## 1 Samuel 22:20

However, one son of Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, managed to escape and fled to David.

## 1 Samuel 22:21

Abiathar told David that Saul had slain the priests of the Lord.

## 1 Samuel 22:22

Then David said to Abiathar,  
“I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there,  
that he would certainly tell Saul.  
I myself have turned against every person in your father’s household.

## 1 Samuel 22:23

Stay with me; do not be afraid,  
for the one who is seeking my life is seeking your life as well,  
but you are safe with me.”
