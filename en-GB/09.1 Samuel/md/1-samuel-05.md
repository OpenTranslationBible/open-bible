# 1 Samuel Chapter 5

## 1 Samuel 5:1

After the Philistines had captured the ark of God, they brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.

## 1 Samuel 5:2

They carried the ark into the temple of Dagon and placed it beside Dagon.

## 1 Samuel 5:3

When the people of Ashdod rose early the next day, there was Dagon, fallen face down on the ground before the ark of the Lord.  
They took Dagon and set him back in his place.

## 1 Samuel 5:4

But the following morning when they rose early, Dagon had fallen again, face down before the ark of the Lord.  
His head and both hands were broken off and were lying on the threshold; only his torso remained.

## 1 Samuel 5:5

That is why to this day neither the priests of Dagon nor anyone who enters Dagon’s temple at Ashdod step on the threshold.

## 1 Samuel 5:6

The Lord’s hand was heavy against the people of Ashdod. He devastated them and afflicted them with tumours.

## 1 Samuel 5:7

When the people of Ashdod saw what was happening, they said, “The ark of the God of Israel must not stay with us, for His hand is harsh against us and against Dagon our god.”

## 1 Samuel 5:8

So they summoned all the rulers of the Philistines and asked, “What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?”  
They answered, “Let it be moved to Gath.”  
So they moved the ark of the God of Israel there.

## 1 Samuel 5:9

But after they had moved it, the Lord’s hand was against that city also. He brought great panic upon it, afflicting the people of the city, both young and old, with tumours, and they broke out in the city.

## 1 Samuel 5:10

So they sent the ark of God to Ekron.  
But as the ark came into Ekron, the people cried out, “They have brought the ark of the God of Israel to us to kill us and our people!”

## 1 Samuel 5:11

So they summoned all the rulers of the Philistines and said, “Send the ark of the God of Israel away. Let it go back to its own place, so that it will not kill us and our people.”  
For death and panic had filled the city; God’s hand was very heavy there.

## 1 Samuel 5:12

Those who survived were afflicted with tumours, and the cries of the city rose up to the heavens.
