# 1 Samuel Chapter 8

## 1 Samuel 8:1

When Samuel grew old, he appointed his sons as judges over Israel.

## 1 Samuel 8:2

His firstborn was named Joel, and his second was Abijah. They served as judges in Beersheba.

## 1 Samuel 8:3

But his sons did not follow his example. They pursued dishonest gain, accepted bribes, and perverted justice.

## 1 Samuel 8:4

Then all the elders of Israel gathered and came to Samuel at Ramah.

## 1 Samuel 8:5

They said to him, “You are old, and your sons do not walk in your ways. Appoint a king to rule over us, like the other nations have.”

## 1 Samuel 8:6

But this request displeased Samuel, especially their demand for a king to judge them. So he prayed to the Lord.

## 1 Samuel 8:7

The Lord said to Samuel, “Listen to the people in all that they say to you. It is not you they have rejected, but Me they have rejected as their king.

## 1 Samuel 8:8

They are acting toward you just as they have done to Me since the day I brought them out of Egypt—forsaking Me and serving other gods.

## 1 Samuel 8:9

Now listen to them, but give them a solemn warning and explain what the king who will reign over them will do.”

## 1 Samuel 8:10

So Samuel relayed all the words of the Lord to the people who were asking him for a king.

## 1 Samuel 8:11

He said, “This is what the king who rules over you will do: He will take your sons and assign them to his chariots and horses, and they will run ahead of his chariots.

## 1 Samuel 8:12

He will appoint commanders of thousands and of fifties, and others to plough his ground and reap his harvest, and to make weapons of war and equipment for his chariots.

## 1 Samuel 8:13

He will take your daughters to be perfumers, cooks, and bakers.

## 1 Samuel 8:14

He will take the best of your fields, vineyards, and olive groves, and give them to his officials.

## 1 Samuel 8:15

He will take a tenth of your grain and your vintage and give it to his eunuchs and officers.

## 1 Samuel 8:16

He will take your male and female servants, the best of your cattle and donkeys, and put them to his own use.

## 1 Samuel 8:17

He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves will become his servants.

## 1 Samuel 8:18

When that day comes, you will cry out because of the king you have chosen for yourselves, but the Lord will not answer you in that day.”

## 1 Samuel 8:19

But the people refused to listen to Samuel. “No!” they said. “We want a king to rule over us.

## 1 Samuel 8:20

Then we will be like all the other nations, with a king to lead us and go out before us and fight our battles.”

## 1 Samuel 8:21

When Samuel heard all that the people said, he repeated it before the Lord.

## 1 Samuel 8:22

And the Lord said to Samuel, “Listen to them and appoint a king for them.”  
Then Samuel said to the men of Israel, “Each of you go back to your own town.”
