# 1 Samuel Chapter 9

## 1 Samuel 9:1

There was a man of Benjamin whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a man of wealth.

## 1 Samuel 9:2

He had a son named Saul, a choice and handsome young man. Among the sons of Israel there was no one more impressive than he; from his shoulders upward he was taller than any of the people.

## 1 Samuel 9:3

Now the donkeys of Kish, Saul’s father, were lost. So Kish said to his son Saul, “Take one of the servants with you and go look for the donkeys.”

## 1 Samuel 9:4

He passed through the hill country of Ephraim and through the land of Shalishah, but they did not find them. Then they went through the land of Shaalim, and they were not there. He also passed through the territory of Benjamin, but they did not find them.

## 1 Samuel 9:5

When they came to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, “Come, let us return, or my father will stop worrying about the donkeys and begin to worry about us.”

## 1 Samuel 9:6

But the servant said, “Behold now, there is a man of God in this city, and he is a man held in honour. All that he says surely comes true. Let us go there now; perhaps he can tell us our way.”

## 1 Samuel 9:7

Then Saul said to his servant, “But look, if we go, what shall we bring the man? The bread is gone from our packs, and we have no gift to present to the man of God. What do we have?”

## 1 Samuel 9:8

The servant answered Saul again and said, “Behold, I have with me a quarter of a shekel of silver. I will give it to the man of God, and he will tell us our way.”

## 1 Samuel 9:9

(Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he would say, “Come, let us go to the seer,” for the prophet of today was formerly called a seer.)

## 1 Samuel 9:10

Then Saul said to his servant, “Your advice is good; come, let us go.”  
So they went to the city where the man of God was.

## 1 Samuel 9:11

As they went up the hill to the city, they met young women going out to draw water, and said to them, “Is the seer here?”

## 1 Samuel 9:12

They answered and said, “Yes, he is just ahead of you. Hurry now, for today he has come to the city, because the people are making a sacrifice at the high place.

## 1 Samuel 9:13

As soon as you enter the city, you will find him before he goes up to the high place to eat, for the people will not eat until he comes. He must bless the sacrifice; afterwards those invited will eat. Go up now, for you will find him at once.”

## 1 Samuel 9:14

So they went up to the city. As they entered, behold, Samuel was coming out toward them to go up to the high place.

## 1 Samuel 9:15

Now the Lord had revealed to Samuel a day before Saul came, saying,

## 1 Samuel 9:16

“Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be prince over My people Israel. He shall deliver My people from the hand of the Philistines, for I have regarded My people, because their cry has come to Me.”

## 1 Samuel 9:17

When Samuel saw Saul, the Lord said to him, “Behold, this is the man of whom I spoke to you! He shall rule over My people.”

## 1 Samuel 9:18

Saul went up to Samuel at the entrance and asked, “Could you please show me the way to the seer’s house?”

## 1 Samuel 9:19

Samuel answered Saul and said, “I am the seer. Go up before me to the high place, for you shall eat with me today. In the morning I will let you go and tell you all that is in your heart.

## 1 Samuel 9:20

As for your donkeys that were lost three days ago, do not worry about them, for they have been found. And to whom is all the desire of Israel turned, if not to you and to all your father’s house?”

## 1 Samuel 9:21

Saul answered and said, “Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel, and is not my family the least of all the clans of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then have you spoken to me this way?”

## 1 Samuel 9:22

Then Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the hall, and gave them a place at the head of those who were invited—about thirty people.

## 1 Samuel 9:23

And Samuel said to the cook, “Bring the portion I gave you, of which I said to you, ‘Set it aside.’”

## 1 Samuel 9:24

So the cook took up the thigh and what was on it and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, “See, what has been reserved is set before you. Eat, for it was kept for you until the appointed time, since I said, ‘I have invited the people.’”  
So Saul ate with Samuel that day.

## 1 Samuel 9:25

After they descended from the high place into the city, Samuel conversed with Saul on the rooftop.

## 1 Samuel 9:26

They arose early, and at daybreak Samuel called to Saul on the rooftop, saying, “Get up, that I may send you on your way.”  
So Saul got up, and both he and Samuel went out into the street.

## 1 Samuel 9:27

As they were going down to the edge of the city, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the servant to go on ahead of us”—and the servant passed on—“but you stand still for a moment, that I may declare to you the word of God.”
