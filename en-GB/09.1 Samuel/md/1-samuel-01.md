# 1 Samuel Chapter 1

## 1 Samuel 1:1

There was a man from Ramathaim Zophim, in the hill country of Ephraim, named Elkanah son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.

## 1 Samuel 1:2

He had two wives. The name of one was Hannah, and the other was Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none.

## 1 Samuel 1:3

Every year this man went up from his town to worship and to offer sacrifices to the Lord of hosts at Shiloh, where the two sons of Eli — Hophni and Phinehas — served as priests of the Lord.

## 1 Samuel 1:4

Whenever Elkanah offered his sacrifice, he would give portions of the meat to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters.

## 1 Samuel 1:5

But to Hannah he gave a double portion, because he loved her, though the Lord had closed her womb.

## 1 Samuel 1:6

Her rival provoked her bitterly to upset her, because the Lord had closed her womb.

## 1 Samuel 1:7

This happened year after year. Whenever Hannah went up to the house of the Lord, her rival provoked her, and she wept and would not eat.

## 1 Samuel 1:8

Elkanah her husband said to her, “Hannah, why are you weeping? Why won’t you eat? Why are you so downcast? Am I not better to you than ten sons?”

## 1 Samuel 1:9

After they had eaten and drunk in Shiloh, Hannah stood up. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his chair by the doorpost of the temple of the Lord.

## 1 Samuel 1:10

Hannah was deeply distressed, and she prayed to the Lord, weeping bitterly.

## 1 Samuel 1:11

She made a vow, saying, “O Lord of hosts, if You will indeed look on the affliction of Your servant, remember me and not forget Your servant, but give Your servant a son, then I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life, and no razor shall touch his head.”

## 1 Samuel 1:12

As she continued praying before the Lord, Eli was watching her mouth.

## 1 Samuel 1:13

Hannah was speaking in her heart; her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. So Eli thought she was drunk.

## 1 Samuel 1:14

And Eli said to her, “How long will you remain drunk? Put away your wine!”

## 1 Samuel 1:15

But Hannah replied, “No, my lord, I am a woman troubled in spirit. I have not been drinking wine or strong drink, but I have been pouring out my soul before the Lord.

## 1 Samuel 1:16

Do not consider your servant a wicked woman, for I have been praying from the depth of my anguish and sorrow.”

## 1 Samuel 1:17

Then Eli answered, “Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant you what you have asked of Him.”

## 1 Samuel 1:18

She said, “Let your servant find favour in your eyes.”  
Then she went her way and ate something, and her face was no longer downcast.

## 1 Samuel 1:19

Early the next morning they arose and worshipped before the Lord, then returned home to Ramah. Elkanah was intimate with Hannah his wife, and the Lord remembered her.

## 1 Samuel 1:20

In due time, Hannah conceived and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel, saying, “Because I asked the Lord for him.”

## 1 Samuel 1:21

When Elkanah went up with all his household to offer the annual sacrifice to the Lord and to fulfil his vow,

## 1 Samuel 1:22

Hannah did not go. She said to her husband, “After the boy is weaned, I will take him, so that he may appear before the Lord and stay there permanently.”

## 1 Samuel 1:23

Elkanah her husband said to her, “Do what seems best to you. Stay until you have weaned him; only may the Lord establish His word.”  
So she stayed at home and nursed her son until she had weaned him.

## 1 Samuel 1:24

After she had weaned him, she took him with her to the house of the Lord in Shiloh, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour, and a skin of wine. The boy was still young.

## 1 Samuel 1:25

They slaughtered the bull and brought the child to Eli.

## 1 Samuel 1:26

She said to him, “Pardon me, my lord. As surely as you live, my lord, I am the woman who stood here beside you, praying to the Lord.

## 1 Samuel 1:27

I prayed for this child, and the Lord has granted me what I asked of Him.

## 1 Samuel 1:28

So now I am dedicating him to the Lord. As long as he lives, he is given to the Lord.”  
And he worshipped the Lord there.
