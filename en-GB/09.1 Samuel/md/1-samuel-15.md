# 1 Samuel Chapter 15

## 1 Samuel 15:1

Samuel said to Saul, “The Lord sent me to anoint you king over His people Israel; now therefore, listen to the words of the Lord.

## 1 Samuel 15:2

This is what the Lord of hosts says: ‘I will punish Amalek for what he did to Israel, how he set himself against him on the way while he was coming up from Egypt.

## 1 Samuel 15:3

Now go and strike Amalek and utterly destroy all that they have. Do not spare them, but put to death both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.’”

## 1 Samuel 15:4

Then Saul summoned the people and counted them at Telaim: two hundred thousand foot soldiers, and ten thousand men of Judah.

## 1 Samuel 15:5

Saul came to the city of Amalek and lay in wait in the valley.

## 1 Samuel 15:6

Saul said to the Kenites, “Go, depart, go down from among the Amalekites, so that I do not destroy you with them; for you showed kindness to all the sons of Israel when they came up from Egypt.” So the Kenites withdrew from among the Amalekites.

## 1 Samuel 15:7

Then Saul struck down the Amalekites from Havilah as you go to Shur, which is east of Egypt.

## 1 Samuel 15:8

He captured Agag, king of the Amalekites, alive, and completely destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.

## 1 Samuel 15:9

But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, the oxen, the fattened animals, the lambs, and all that was good, and were unwilling to utterly destroy them. But everything despised and worthless, that they completely destroyed.

## 1 Samuel 15:10

Then the word of the Lord came to Samuel, saying,

## 1 Samuel 15:11

“I regret that I have made Saul king, for he has turned away from following Me and has not carried out My commands.”  
And Samuel was distressed and cried out to the Lord all night.

## 1 Samuel 15:12

Samuel rose early in the morning to meet Saul; and it was reported to Samuel, saying, “Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set up a monument for himself, then turned and proceeded down to Gilgal.”

## 1 Samuel 15:13

Samuel came to Saul, and Saul said to him, “Blessed are you of the Lord! I have carried out the command of the Lord.”

## 1 Samuel 15:14

But Samuel said, “Then what is this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?”

## 1 Samuel 15:15

Saul said, “They have brought them from the Amalekites, for the people spared the best of the sheep and oxen to sacrifice to the Lord your God; but the rest we have completely destroyed.”

---

## 1 Samuel 15:16

Then Samuel said to Saul, “Stop! I will tell you what the Lord said to me last night.”  
And he said to him, “Speak.”

## 1 Samuel 15:17

Samuel said, “Is it not true, though you were little in your own eyes, you were made the head of the tribes of Israel? And the Lord anointed you king over Israel,

## 1 Samuel 15:18

and the Lord sent you on a mission and said, ‘Go and utterly destroy the sinners, the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are exterminated.’

## 1 Samuel 15:19

Why then did you not obey the voice of the Lord, but rushed upon the spoil and did what was evil in the sight of the Lord?”

## 1 Samuel 15:20

Then Saul said to Samuel, “I did obey the voice of the Lord, and went on the mission on which the Lord sent me, and have brought back Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.

## 1 Samuel 15:21

But the people took some of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the best of the things devoted to destruction, to sacrifice to the Lord your God at Gilgal.”

---

## 1 Samuel 15:22

Samuel said,

> “Has the Lord as much delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices  
> As in obeying the voice of the Lord?  
> Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice,  
> And to listen than the fat of rams.

## 1 Samuel 15:23

> For rebellion is as the sin of divination,  
> And insubordination is as iniquity and idolatry.  
> Because you have rejected the word of the Lord,  
> He has also rejected you from being king.”

---

## 1 Samuel 15:24

Then Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned; I have indeed transgressed the command of the Lord and your words, because I feared the people and listened to their voice.

## 1 Samuel 15:25

Now therefore, please pardon my sin and return with me, so that I may worship the Lord.”

## 1 Samuel 15:26

But Samuel said to Saul, “I will not return with you; for you have rejected the word of the Lord, and the Lord has rejected you from being king over Israel.”

## 1 Samuel 15:27

As Samuel turned to go, Saul grabbed the edge of his robe, and it tore.

## 1 Samuel 15:28

So Samuel said to him, “The Lord has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to your neighbour who is better than you.

## 1 Samuel 15:29

Also the Glory of Israel will not lie or change His mind; for He is not a man, that He should change His mind.”

---

## 1 Samuel 15:30

Then Saul said, “I have sinned; but please honour me now before the elders of my people and before Israel, and return with me, so that I may worship the Lord your God.”

## 1 Samuel 15:31

So Samuel returned after Saul, and Saul worshipped the Lord.

## 1 Samuel 15:32

Then Samuel said, “Bring me Agag the king of the Amalekites.”  
And Agag came to him cheerfully. And Agag said, “Surely the bitterness of death is past.”

## 1 Samuel 15:33

But Samuel said,

> “As your sword has made women childless,  
> So shall your mother be childless among women.”  
> And Samuel hacked Agag to pieces before the Lord at Gilgal.

## 1 Samuel 15:34

Then Samuel went to Ramah, but Saul went up to his house at Gibeah of Saul.

## 1 Samuel 15:35

Samuel did not see Saul again until the day of his death;  
for Samuel grieved over Saul, and the Lord regretted that He had made Saul king over Israel.
