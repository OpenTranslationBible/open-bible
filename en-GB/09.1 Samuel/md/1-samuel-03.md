# 1 Samuel Chapter 3

## 1 Samuel 3:1

The boy Samuel ministered before the Lord under Eli.  
In those days the word of the Lord was rare; visions were not widespread.

## 1 Samuel 3:2

One night Eli, whose eyesight had grown dim so that he could not see well, was lying in his usual place.

## 1 Samuel 3:3

The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying in the temple of the Lord, where the ark of God was.

## 1 Samuel 3:4

Then the Lord called out to Samuel.  
He answered, “Here I am!”

## 1 Samuel 3:5

He ran to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.”  
But Eli said, “I did not call you; go back and lie down.”  
So he went and lay down.

## 1 Samuel 3:6

Again the Lord called, “Samuel!”  
Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.”  
But Eli replied, “I did not call you, my son. Go back and lie down.”

## 1 Samuel 3:7

Samuel hadn't yet met with the Lord, and the word of the Lord had not been disclosed to him.

## 1 Samuel 3:8

The Lord called Samuel a third time.  
He got up, went to Eli, and said, “Here I am, for you called me.”  
Then Eli understood that the Lord was calling the boy.

## 1 Samuel 3:9

So Eli said to Samuel, “Go and lie down, and if He calls you again, say, ‘Speak, Lord, for Your servant is listening.’”  
So Samuel went and lay down in his place.

## 1 Samuel 3:10

The Lord came and stood nearby, calling as He had done before, “Samuel! Samuel!”  
Then Samuel said, “Speak, for Your servant is listening.”

## 1 Samuel 3:11

And the Lord said to Samuel, “See, I am about to do something in Israel that will make the ears of everyone who hears of it tingle.

## 1 Samuel 3:12

On that day I will carry out against Eli everything I have spoken concerning his house—from beginning to end.

## 1 Samuel 3:13

For I told him that I would judge his family forever because of the iniquity he knew about—how his sons blasphemed God, and he did not restrain them.

## 1 Samuel 3:14

Therefore I swore to the house of Eli, ‘The guilt of Eli’s house shall never be atoned for by sacrifice or offering.’”

## 1 Samuel 3:15

Samuel lay down until morning. Then he opened the doors of the house of the Lord.  
But Samuel was afraid to tell Eli about the vision.

## 1 Samuel 3:16

Eli called him and said, “Samuel, my son.”  
Samuel answered, “Here I am.”

## 1 Samuel 3:17

“What did He say to you?” Eli asked. “Do not hide it from me. May God deal with you, be it ever so severely, if you conceal from me anything He told you.”

## 1 Samuel 3:18

So Samuel told him everything and hid nothing.  
Then Eli said, “He is the Lord; let Him do what is good in His eyes.”

## 1 Samuel 3:19

Samuel grew up, and the Lord was with him, and He let none of Samuel’s words fall to the ground.

## 1 Samuel 3:20

And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba recognised that Samuel was confirmed as a prophet of the Lord.

## 1 Samuel 3:21

The Lord continued to appear at Shiloh, for there He revealed Himself to Samuel by His word.
