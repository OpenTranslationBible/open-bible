## 1 Samuel 10:1

Then Samuel took a flask of oil and poured it on Saul’s head, kissed him, and said, “Has not the Lord anointed you ruler over His inheritance?

## 1 Samuel 10:2

When you depart from me today, you will find two men near Rachel’s tomb, in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah. They will say to you, ‘The donkeys which you went to look for have been found. Now your father has stopped worrying about the donkeys and is anxious for you, saying, “What shall I do about my son?”’

## 1 Samuel 10:3

Then you shall go on from there and come to the oak of Tabor. Three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you there, one carrying three young goats, another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a skin of wine.

## 1 Samuel 10:4

They will greet you and give you two loaves of bread, which you shall receive from their hand.

## 1 Samuel 10:5

After that, you shall come to Gibeath-haelohim, where the Philistine garrison is. As you approach the town, you will meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with harp, tambourine, flute, and lyre before them, and they will be prophesying.

## 1 Samuel 10:6

Then the Spirit of the Lord will come upon you mightily, and you shall prophesy with them and be turned into another man.

## 1 Samuel 10:7

And when these signs come to you, do what your hand finds to do, for God is with you.

## 1 Samuel 10:8

You shall go down before me to Gilgal. And behold, I will come down to you to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice peace offerings. You shall wait seven days until I come to you and show you what you must do.”

## 1 Samuel 10:9

Then it happened that as Saul turned to leave Samuel, God gave him another heart, and all those signs came to pass that day.

## 1 Samuel 10:10

When they came to Gibeah, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them.

## 1 Samuel 10:11

And when all who knew him previously saw that he prophesied with the prophets, the people said to one another, “What has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?”

## 1 Samuel 10:12

And someone from there answered and said, “But who is their father?” Therefore it became a proverb: “Is Saul also among the prophets?”

## 1 Samuel 10:13

When he had finished prophesying, he came to the high place.

## 1 Samuel 10:14

Saul’s uncle said to him and to his servant, “Where did you go?”  
And he said, “To look for the donkeys. When we saw that they were not to be found, we went to Samuel.”

## 1 Samuel 10:15

Saul’s uncle said, “Please tell me what Samuel said to you.”

## 1 Samuel 10:16

Saul said to his uncle, “He told us plainly that the donkeys had been found.” But he did not tell him about the matter of the kingdom of which Samuel had spoken.

## 1 Samuel 10:17

Then Samuel summoned the people to gather before the Lord at Mizpah.

## 1 Samuel 10:18

He said to the sons of Israel, “Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, ‘I brought Israel up out of Egypt, and I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the power of all the kingdoms that oppressed you.’

## 1 Samuel 10:19

But you have today rejected your God, who saves you from all your calamities and your distresses, and you have said, ‘No! Set a king over us.’ Now therefore present yourselves before the Lord by your tribes and by your clans.”

## 1 Samuel 10:20

So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken by lot.

## 1 Samuel 10:21

Then he brought the tribe of Benjamin near by its families, and the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken. But when they looked for him, he could not be found.

## 1 Samuel 10:22

So they inquired further of the Lord, “Has the man come here yet?” And the Lord said, “Behold, he has hidden himself among the baggage.”

## 1 Samuel 10:23

So they ran and took him from there. And when he stood among the people, he was taller than all the people from his shoulders upward.

## 1 Samuel 10:24

Samuel said to all the people, “Do you see the one the Lord has chosen? Surely there is none like him among all the people.”  
So all the people shouted, “Long live the king!”

## 1 Samuel 10:25

Then Samuel told the people the regulations of the kingship and wrote them in a book and laid it up before the Lord. Then Samuel sent all the people away, each to his own house.

## 1 Samuel 10:26

Saul returned to his home in Gibeah, accompanied by the valiant men whose hearts God had touched.

## 1 Samuel 10:27

But some worthless men said, “How can this man save us?” And they despised him and did not bring him any gift.  
But Saul held his peace.
