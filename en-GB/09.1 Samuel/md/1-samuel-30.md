# 1 Samuel Chapter 30

## 1 Samuel 30:1

When David and his men arrived at Ziklag on the third day,  
they discovered that the Amalekites had raided the Negev and Ziklag,  
overthrowing Ziklag and setting it ablaze.

## 1 Samuel 30:2

And they took captive the women and all who were in it, both small and great,  
without killing anyone, and drove them off and went their way.

## 1 Samuel 30:3

Upon reaching the city, David and his men found it burned,  
and realised their wives, sons, and daughters had been taken captive.

## 1 Samuel 30:4

Then David and the people who were with him raised their voices and wept  
until they had no strength left to weep.

## 1 Samuel 30:5

David’s two wives had also been taken captive,  
Ahinoam the Jezreelitess and Abigail, the widow of Nabal the Carmelite.

## 1 Samuel 30:6

David was deeply troubled because the people spoke of stoning him,  
for they were all embittered, each one because of his sons and daughters.  
But David found strength in the Lord his God.

## 1 Samuel 30:7

David then spoke to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, “Please bring me the ephod.”  
So Abiathar brought the ephod to David.

## 1 Samuel 30:8

David sought guidance from the Lord, asking,  
“Shall I pursue this band of raiders? Will I overtake them?”  
And He replied,  
“Pursue them, for you will surely overtake them and rescue everyone.”

## 1 Samuel 30:9

So David set out with the six hundred men who were with him,  
and they reached the brook Besor, where those who stayed behind remained.

## 1 Samuel 30:10

David continued the pursuit with four hundred men,  
while two hundred, who were too exhausted to cross the brook Besor, stayed behind.

## 1 Samuel 30:11

They came across an Egyptian in the field and brought him to David,  
giving him bread to eat and water to drink.

## 1 Samuel 30:12

They provided him with a slice of fig cake and two clusters of raisins,  
and after he ate, his spirit revived,  
for he had not eaten bread or drunk water for three days and three nights.

## 1 Samuel 30:13

David asked him, “To whom do you belong, and where are you from?”  
He replied, “I am a young Egyptian, a servant of an Amalekite,  
and my master left me behind when I fell ill three days ago.

## 1 Samuel 30:14

We carried out a raid on the Negev of the Cherethites,  
and on that which belongs to Judah,  
and on the Negev of Caleb,  
and we burned Ziklag with fire.”

## 1 Samuel 30:15

Then David said to him, “Will you lead me to this band?”  
And he said, “Swear to me by God that you will not kill me or hand me over to my master,  
and I will lead you to this band.”

## 1 Samuel 30:16

When he had led him down, they found them spread out over all the land,  
eating, drinking, and celebrating,  
because of all the great plunder they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah.

## 1 Samuel 30:17

David attacked them from twilight until the evening of the next day;  
and not a man of them escaped, except four hundred young men who rode on camels and fled.

## 1 Samuel 30:18

David recovered everything the Amalekites had taken,  
including rescuing his two wives.

## 1 Samuel 30:19

And nothing of theirs was missing, whether small or great, sons or daughters, plunder or anything that they had taken for themselves;  
David brought everything back.

## 1 Samuel 30:20

So David captured all the sheep and the cattle which the people drove ahead of the other livestock,  
and they said, “This is David’s plunder.”

## 1 Samuel 30:21

When David came to the two hundred men who were too exhausted to follow him  
and had also been left at the brook Besor,  
they came out to meet David and to meet the people who were with him.  
Then David approached the people and greeted them.

## 1 Samuel 30:22

Then all the wicked and useless men among those who went with David said,  
“Since they did not go with us, we will not give them any of the spoils that we have recovered,  
except to each man his wife and his children, so that they may lead them away and leave.”

## 1 Samuel 30:23

But David said,  
“You must not do so, my brothers, with what the Lord has given us,  
who has protected us and handed over to us the band that came against us.

## 1 Samuel 30:24

And who will listen to you in this matter?  
For as is the share of the one who goes down to the battle, so shall be the share of the one who stays with the baggage;  
they shall share alike.”

## 1 Samuel 30:25

From that day onwards, it was established as a statute and an ordinance for Israel.

## 1 Samuel 30:26

Upon returning to Ziklag, David sent some of the spoils to the elders of Judah,  
to his friends, saying, “Here is a gift for you from the spoils of the enemies of the Lord:

## 1 Samuel 30:27

to those in Bethel, Ramoth of the Negev, and Jattir;

## 1 Samuel 30:28

to those in Aroer, Siphmoth, and Eshtemoa;

## 1 Samuel 30:29

to those in Racal, and to those in the cities of the Jerahmeelites,  
and to those in the cities of the Kenites;

## 1 Samuel 30:30

to those in Hormah, Bor-ashan, and Athach;

## 1 Samuel 30:31

and to those in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men walked.”
