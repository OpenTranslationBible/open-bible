# 1 Samuel Chapter 30

## 1 Samuel 30:1

Then it happened, when David and his men came to Ziklag on the third day,  
that the Amalekites had made a raid on the Negev and on Ziklag,  
and had overthrown Ziklag and burned it with fire.

## 1 Samuel 30:2

And they took captive the women and all who were in it, both small and great,  
without killing anyone, and drove them off and went their way.

## 1 Samuel 30:3

When David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burned with fire,  
and their wives, their sons, and their daughters had been taken captive.

## 1 Samuel 30:4

Then David and the people who were with him raised their voices and wept  
until they had no strength left to weep.

## 1 Samuel 30:5

Now David’s two wives had been taken captive,  
Ahinoam the Jezreelitess and Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite.

## 1 Samuel 30:6

Moreover, David was greatly distressed because the people spoke of stoning him,  
for all the people were embittered, each one because of his sons and his daughters.  
But David strengthened himself in the Lord his God.

## 1 Samuel 30:7

Then David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, “Please bring me the ephod.”  
So Abiathar brought the ephod to David.

## 1 Samuel 30:8

And David inquired of the Lord, saying,  
“Shall I pursue this band of raiders? Will I overtake them?”  
And He said to him,  
“Pursue, for you will certainly overtake them, and you will certainly rescue everyone.”

## 1 Samuel 30:9

So David left, he and the six hundred men who were with him,  
and they came to the brook Besor, where those left behind remained.

## 1 Samuel 30:10

But David pursued, he and four hundred men,  
for two hundred who were too exhausted to cross the brook Besor remained behind.

## 1 Samuel 30:11

Now they found an Egyptian in the field and brought him to David,  
and gave him bread and he ate, and they provided him water to drink.

## 1 Samuel 30:12

They gave him a slice of fig cake and two clusters of raisins,  
and he ate; then his spirit revived,  
for he had not eaten bread or drunk water for three days and three nights.

## 1 Samuel 30:13

Then David said to him, “To whom do you belong, and where are you from?”  
And he said, “I am a young man of Egypt, a servant of an Amalekite,  
and my master abandoned me when I became sick three days ago.

## 1 Samuel 30:14

We carried out a raid on the Negev of the Cherethites,  
and on that which belongs to Judah,  
and on the Negev of Caleb,  
and we burned Ziklag with fire.”

## 1 Samuel 30:15

Then David said to him, “Will you bring me down to this band?”  
And he said, “Swear to me by God that you will not kill me or hand me over to my master,  
and I will bring you down to this band.”

## 1 Samuel 30:16

Now when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread out over all the land,  
eating and drinking and celebrating,  
because of all the great plunder they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah.

## 1 Samuel 30:17

Then David slaughtered them from the twilight until the evening of the next day;  
and not a man of them escaped, except four hundred young men who rode on camels and fled.

## 1 Samuel 30:18

So David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken,  
and rescued his two wives.

## 1 Samuel 30:19

And nothing of theirs was missing, whether small or great, sons or daughters, plunder or anything that they had taken for themselves;  
David brought everything back.

## 1 Samuel 30:20

So David captured all the sheep and the cattle which the people drove ahead of the other livestock,  
and they said, “This is David’s plunder.”

## 1 Samuel 30:21

When David came to the two hundred men who were too exhausted to follow David  
and had also been left at the brook Besor,  
they came out to meet David and to meet the people who were with him.  
Then David approached the people and greeted them.

## 1 Samuel 30:22

Then all the wicked and useless men among those who went with David said,  
“Since they did not go with us, we will not give them any of the spoils that we have recovered,  
except to each man his wife and his children, so that they may lead them away and leave.”

## 1 Samuel 30:23

But David said,  
“You must not do so, my brothers, with what the Lord has given us,  
who has protected us and handed over to us the band that came against us.

## 1 Samuel 30:24

And who will listen to you in this matter?  
For as is the share of the one who goes down to the battle, so shall be the share of the one who stays with the baggage;  
they shall share alike.”

## 1 Samuel 30:25

From that day onwards, it was established as a statute and an ordinance for Israel.

## 1 Samuel 30:26

Now when David came to Ziklag, he sent some of the spoils to the elders of Judah,  
to his friends, saying, “Behold, a gift for you from the spoils of the enemies of the Lord:

## 1 Samuel 30:27

to those in Bethel, Ramoth of the Negev, and Jattir;

## 1 Samuel 30:28

to those in Aroer, Siphmoth, and Eshtemoa;

## 1 Samuel 30:29

to those in Racal, and to those in the cities of the Jerahmeelites,  
and to those in the cities of the Kenites;

## 1 Samuel 30:30

to those in Hormah, Bor-ashan, and Athach;

## 1 Samuel 30:31

and to those in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men walked.”
