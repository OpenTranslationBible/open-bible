# 1 Samuel Chapter 25

## 1 Samuel 25:1

Then Samuel died, and all Israel gathered and mourned for him, and buried him at his house in Ramah.  
And David arose and went down to the wilderness of Paran.

## 1 Samuel 25:2

Now there was a man in Maon whose business was in Carmel;  
and the man was very rich, and he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats.  
And it came about while he was shearing his sheep in Carmel—

## 1 Samuel 25:3

Now the man’s name was Nabal, and his wife’s name was Abigail.  
And the woman was intelligent and beautiful in appearance,  
but the man was harsh and evil in his dealings, and he was a Calebite.

## 1 Samuel 25:4

Then David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.

## 1 Samuel 25:5

So David sent ten young men; and David said to the young men,  
“Go up to Carmel, visit Nabal, and greet him in my name.

## 1 Samuel 25:6

And this is what you shall say: ‘Peace to you, and peace to your house, and peace to all that you have!

## 1 Samuel 25:7

Now I have heard that you have shearers.  
Now your shepherds have been with us, and we did not insult them,  
nor did they miss anything all the days they were in Carmel.

## 1 Samuel 25:8

Ask your young men and they will tell you.  
Therefore, let my young men find favour in your sight,  
for we have come on a festive day.  
Please give whatever you find at hand to your servants and to your son David.’”

## 1 Samuel 25:9

When David’s young men arrived, they relayed all these words to Nabal on behalf of David; then they awaited his response.

## 1 Samuel 25:10

But Nabal answered David’s servants and said,  
“Who is David? And who is the son of Jesse?  
There are many servants today who are each breaking away from his master.

## 1 Samuel 25:11

Shall I then take my bread and my water and my meat that I have slaughtered for my shearers,  
and give it to men whose origin I do not know?”

## 1 Samuel 25:12

So David’s young men returned and went back; and they came and told him all these words.

## 1 Samuel 25:13

David said to his men, “Each of you strap on his sword!”  
So each man strapped on his sword, and David also strapped on his sword.  
And about four hundred men went up behind David, while two hundred stayed with the supplies.

## 1 Samuel 25:14

But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying,  
“Behold, David sent messengers from the wilderness to greet our master, and he shouted at them in anger.

## 1 Samuel 25:15

Yet the men were very good to us, and we were not insulted, nor did we miss anything  
as long as we went with them, while we were in the fields.

## 1 Samuel 25:16

They protected us both by night and by day, all the time we were with them tending the sheep.

## 1 Samuel 25:17

Now then, be aware and consider what you should do,  
for harm is determined against our master and against all his household;  
and he is such a worthless man that no one can speak to him.”

## 1 Samuel 25:18

Then Abigail hurried and took two hundred loaves of bread, two jugs of wine,  
five sheep already prepared, five seahs of roasted grain,  
a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and loaded them on donkeys.

## 1 Samuel 25:19

She said to her young men, “Go on ahead of me; behold, I am coming after you.”  
But she did not tell her husband Nabal.

## 1 Samuel 25:20

And it happened as she was riding on her donkey and coming down by the hidden part of the mountain,  
that behold, David and his men were coming down toward her; so she met them.

## 1 Samuel 25:21

Now David had said, “It was surely in vain that I protected all that this man has in the wilderness,  
so that nothing was missed of all that belonged to him; and he has returned me evil for good.

## 1 Samuel 25:22

May God do so to the enemies of David, and more so, if by morning I leave as much as one male of any who belong to him alive.”

---

## 1 Samuel 25:23

When Abigail saw David, she hurried and dismounted from her donkey,  
and fell on her face before David and bowed down to the ground.

## 1 Samuel 25:24

She fell at his feet and said,  
“On me alone, my lord, be the guilt.  
And please let your slave speak to you, and listen to the words of your slave.

## 1 Samuel 25:25

Please do not let my lord pay attention to this worthless man, Nabal,  
for as his name is, so is he: Nabal is his name, and foolishness is with him.  
But I, your slave, did not see the young men of my lord whom you sent.

## 1 Samuel 25:26

Now then, my lord, as the Lord lives and as your soul lives,  
since the Lord has restrained you from shedding blood,  
and from avenging yourself by your own hand,  
now then, may your enemies and those who seek evil against my lord be like Nabal.

## 1 Samuel 25:27

And now, let this gift which your servant has brought to my lord  
be given to the young men who accompany my lord.

## 1 Samuel 25:28

Please forgive the offence of your slave;  
for the Lord will certainly make for my lord an enduring house,  
because my lord is fighting the battles of the Lord,  
and evil will not be found in you all your days.

## 1 Samuel 25:29

And when someone arises to pursue you and to seek your life,  
the life of my lord will be bound in the bundle of the living with the Lord your God;  
but the lives of your enemies He will sling out as from the hollow of a sling.

## 1 Samuel 25:30

And when the Lord does for my lord in accordance with all the good that He has spoken concerning you,  
and appoints you ruler over Israel,

## 1 Samuel 25:31

this will not become an obstacle to you, or a troubled heart to my lord,  
both by having shed blood without cause and by my lord having avenged himself.  
When the Lord deals well with my lord, then remember your slave.”

---

## 1 Samuel 25:32

Then David said to Abigail,  
“Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me,

## 1 Samuel 25:33

and blessed be your discernment,  
and blessed be you, who have kept me this day from bloodshed  
and from avenging myself by my own hand.

## 1 Samuel 25:34

Nevertheless, as the Lord God of Israel lives, who has restrained me from harming you,  
if you had not come quickly to meet me,  
certainly by morning there would not have been left to Nabal as much as one male.”

## 1 Samuel 25:35

So David accepted from her hand what she had brought him, and said to her,  
“Go up to your house in peace. See, I have listened to you and granted your request.”

---

## 1 Samuel 25:36

Then Abigail came to Nabal, and behold, he was holding a feast in his house, like the feast of a king.  
And Nabal’s heart was merry within him, for he was very drunk;  
so she did not tell him anything at all until the morning light.

## 1 Samuel 25:37

But in the morning, when the wine had gone out of Nabal, his wife told him these things,  
and his heart died within him, and he became like a stone.

## 1 Samuel 25:38

About ten days later, the Lord struck Nabal and he died.

---

## 1 Samuel 25:39

When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said,  
“Blessed be the Lord, who has pleaded the cause of the insult directed at me by the hand of Nabal,  
and has kept His servant from evil.  
The Lord has also returned the evil of Nabal on his own head.”  
Then David sent a proposal to Abigail, to take her as his wife.

## 1 Samuel 25:40

When David’s servants came to Abigail at Carmel, they spoke to her, saying,  
“David has sent us to you, to take you as his wife.”

## 1 Samuel 25:41

She got up and bowed with her face to the ground, and said,  
“Behold, your servant is a slave to wash the feet of my lord’s servants.”

## 1 Samuel 25:42

Then Abigail got up quickly, and rode on a donkey, with her five female attendants following her;  
and she went after the messengers of David and became his wife.

---

## 1 Samuel 25:43

David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel, and she became his wife alongside Abigail.

## 1 Samuel 25:44

Now Saul had given his daughter Michal, David’s wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was from Gallim.
