# 1 Samuel Chapter 23

## 1 Samuel 23:1

Then they told David, “Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah and are plundering the threshing floors.”

## 1 Samuel 23:2

So David inquired of the Lord, saying, “Shall I go and attack these Philistines?”  
And the Lord said to David, “Go and attack the Philistines and save Keilah.”

## 1 Samuel 23:3

But David’s men said to him, “Behold, we are afraid here in Judah.  
How much more then if we go to Keilah against the ranks of the Philistines?”

## 1 Samuel 23:4

Then David inquired of the Lord once more.  
And the Lord answered him and said, “Arise, go down to Keilah, for I will hand the Philistines over to you.”

## 1 Samuel 23:5

So David and his men went to Keilah and fought with the Philistines.  
He led away their livestock and struck them with a great slaughter.  
Thus David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.

## 1 Samuel 23:6

Now when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah,  
he came down with an ephod in his hand.

## 1 Samuel 23:7

When it was reported to Saul that David had come to Keilah, Saul said,  
“God has handed him over to me, for he shut himself in by entering a city with double gates and bars.”

## 1 Samuel 23:8

So Saul gathered all the people to go down to Keilah, intending to besiege David and his men.

## 1 Samuel 23:9

Now David knew that Saul was plotting evil against him;  
so he said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring the ephod here.”

## 1 Samuel 23:10

Then David said, “Lord God of Israel, Your servant has heard for certain that Saul is planning to come to Keilah,  
to destroy the city on my account.

## 1 Samuel 23:11

Will the men of Keilah hand me over to him? Will Saul come down just as Your servant has heard?  
Lord God of Israel, I pray, tell Your servant.”  
And the Lord said, “He will come down.”

## 1 Samuel 23:12

Then David said, “Will the men of Keilah hand me and my men over to Saul?”  
And the Lord said, “They will hand you over.”

## 1 Samuel 23:13

So David and his men, about six hundred, arose and left Keilah, and they went wherever they could go.  
When it was reported to Saul that David had escaped from Keilah, he gave up the pursuit.

## 1 Samuel 23:14

David stayed in the wilderness strongholds and remained in the hill country of the wilderness of Ziph.  
And Saul searched for him every day, but God did not hand him over to him.

## 1 Samuel 23:15

Now David became aware that Saul had come out to seek his life,  
while David was in the wilderness of Ziph, at Horesh.

## 1 Samuel 23:16

And Jonathan, Saul’s son, went to David at Horesh and strengthened his faith in God.

## 1 Samuel 23:17

He said to him,  
“Do not be afraid, for the hand of my father Saul will not find you,  
and you will be king over Israel and I will be second to you;  
and Saul my father knows that also.”

## 1 Samuel 23:18

So the two of them made a covenant before the Lord.  
And David stayed at Horesh, while Jonathan went to his house.

## 1 Samuel 23:19

Then Ziphites came up to Saul at Gibeah, saying,  
“Is David not hiding with us in the strongholds at Horesh, on the hill of Hachilah, which is south of Jeshimon?

## 1 Samuel 23:20

Now then, O king, come down, according to all the desire of your soul to do so;  
and our part shall be to hand him over to the king.”

## 1 Samuel 23:21

Saul said, “May you be blessed by the Lord, for you have shown kindness to me.

## 1 Samuel 23:22

Go now, be very careful, and find out where he is and who has seen him there;  
for I am told that he is very cunning.

## 1 Samuel 23:23

So look and learn about all the hiding places where he hides himself, and return to me with certainty,  
and I will go with you.  
And if he is in the land, I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah.”

## 1 Samuel 23:24

Then they set out and went to Ziph before Saul.  
Now David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah to the south of Jeshimon.

## 1 Samuel 23:25

When Saul and his men went to search for him, they told David,  
and he went down to the rock and stayed in the wilderness of Maon.  
When Saul heard it, he pursued David in the wilderness of Maon.

## 1 Samuel 23:26

And Saul went on one side of the mountain, and David and his men on the other side of the mountain.  
And David was hurrying to get away from Saul,  
for Saul and his men were surrounding David and his men to seize them.

## 1 Samuel 23:27

But a messenger came to Saul, saying, “Hurry and come,  
for the Philistines have made a raid on the land!”

## 1 Samuel 23:28

So Saul returned from pursuing David and went to confront the Philistines;  
therefore they called that place the Rock of Escape.

## 1 Samuel 23:29

And David departed from there and stayed in the strongholds of Engedi.
