## 1 Samuel 28:1

Now it came about in those days that the Philistines gathered their armed camps for war, to fight against Israel.  
And Achish said to David, “Know for certain that you will go out with me in the army, you and your men.”

## 1 Samuel 28:2

David said to Achish, “Very well, you shall know what your servant can do.”  
So Achish said to David, “Very well, I will appoint you as my bodyguard for life.”

## 1 Samuel 28:3

Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in Ramah, his own city.  
And Saul had removed the mediums and spiritists from the land.

## 1 Samuel 28:4

The Philistines gathered and set up camp in Shunem, while Saul assembled all Israel, and they encamped in Gilboa.

## 1 Samuel 28:5

When Saul observed the Philistine camp, he was filled with fear and his heart trembled intensely.

## 1 Samuel 28:6

So Saul inquired of the Lord, but the Lord did not answer him, either by dreams, or by Urim, or by prophets.

## 1 Samuel 28:7

Then Saul said to his servants, “Seek out a woman who is a medium, so that I may visit her and seek her counsel.”  
And his servants replied, “Behold, there is a woman who is a medium at En-dor.”

## 1 Samuel 28:8

So Saul disguised himself by putting on different clothes and went, he and two men with him,  
and they came to the woman by night.  
And he said, “Consult a spirit for me, please, and bring up for me the one whom I shall name to you.”

## 1 Samuel 28:9

But the woman said to him,  
“Behold, you know what Saul has done, how he has eliminated the mediums and the spiritists from the land.  
Why then are you setting a trap for my life, to bring about my death?”

## 1 Samuel 28:10

So Saul vowed to her by the Lord, saying,  
“As the Lord lives, no punishment shall come upon you for this thing.”

## 1 Samuel 28:11

Then the woman asked, “Whom shall I summon for you?”  
And he replied, “Call up Samuel for me.”

## 1 Samuel 28:12

When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out loudly;  
and the woman spoke to Saul, saying,  
“Why have you deceived me? For you are Saul!”

## 1 Samuel 28:13

But the king said to her, “Do not be afraid; tell me what you see.”  
And the woman said to Saul, “I see a divine being rising from the earth.”

## 1 Samuel 28:14

And he said to her, “What is his appearance?”  
And she said, “An old man is coming up, and he is wrapped in a robe.”  
Then Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground and paid homage.

## 1 Samuel 28:15

Then Samuel said to Saul,  
“Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?”  
And Saul answered,  
“I am greatly distressed; for the Philistines are waging war against me, and God has departed from me  
and no longer answers me, either by prophets or by dreams.  
Therefore I have called you, so that you may let me know what I should do.”

## 1 Samuel 28:16

Samuel said, “Why then do you ask me, since the Lord has left you and is now opposed to you?

## 1 Samuel 28:17

And the Lord has done just as He spoke through me;  
for the Lord has torn the kingdom from your hand and given it to your neighbour, to David.

## 1 Samuel 28:18

Because you did not obey the voice of the Lord and did not execute His fierce wrath on Amalek,  
so the Lord has done this thing to you this day.

## 1 Samuel 28:19

Furthermore, the Lord will also hand Israel along with you over to the Philistines;  
and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me.  
Indeed, the Lord will hand over the army of Israel to the Philistines!”

## 1 Samuel 28:20

Then Saul immediately fell full length to the ground, and was very afraid because of Samuel’s words.  
There was no strength in him, because he had eaten no food all day and all night.

## 1 Samuel 28:21

Then the woman came to Saul and saw that he was terrified,  
and said to him, “Behold, your servant has obeyed you, and I have taken my life in my hand  
and have listened to your words which you spoke to me.

## 1 Samuel 28:22

So now you too, please listen to the voice of your servant,  
and let me set a piece of bread before you, so that you may eat and have strength when you go on your way.”

## 1 Samuel 28:23

But he refused, saying, “I will not eat.” However, his servants, along with the woman, persuaded him, and he heeded them.  
So he got up from the ground and sat on the bed.

## 1 Samuel 28:24

Now the woman had a fattened calf in the house, and she quickly slaughtered it.  
And she took flour, kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread from it.

## 1 Samuel 28:25

She brought it before Saul and his servants, and they ate.  
Then they got up and left that night.
