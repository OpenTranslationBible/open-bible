# 1 Samuel Chapter 16

## 1 Samuel 16:1

The Lord said to Samuel, “How long will you grieve over Saul, since I have rejected him from being king over Israel?  
Fill your horn with oil and go; I am sending you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have selected a king for Myself from among his sons.”

## 1 Samuel 16:2

But Samuel said, “How can I go? If Saul hears of it, he will kill me.”  
And the Lord said, “Take a heifer with you and say, ‘I have come to sacrifice to the Lord.’

## 1 Samuel 16:3

Then invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what to do;  
and you shall anoint for Me the one whom I indicate to you.”

## 1 Samuel 16:4

So Samuel did what the Lord said and went to Bethlehem.  
The elders of the town came trembling to meet him and said, “Do you come in peace?”

## 1 Samuel 16:5

He said, “Yes, in peace; I have come to sacrifice to the Lord.  
Consecrate yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice.”  
Then he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.

## 1 Samuel 16:6

As they arrived, he observed Eliab and thought, “Surely the Lord’s anointed stands here before Him.”

## 1 Samuel 16:7

But the Lord said to Samuel,

> “Do not look at his appearance or at the height of his stature,  
> because I have rejected him;  
> for the Lord does not see as man sees,  
> for man looks at the outward appearance,  
> but the Lord looks at the heart.”

## 1 Samuel 16:8

Then Jesse called Abinadab and made him pass before Samuel.  
But he said, “The Lord has not chosen this one either.”

## 1 Samuel 16:9

Next Jesse made Shammah pass by.  
But he said, “The Lord has not chosen this one either.”

## 1 Samuel 16:10

So Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel.  
But Samuel said to Jesse, “The Lord has not chosen these.”

## 1 Samuel 16:11

Then Samuel said to Jesse, “Are these all the boys?”  
And he said, “There remains yet the youngest, but behold, he is tending the sheep.”  
So Samuel said to Jesse, “Send and bring him, for we will not sit down until he comes here.”

## 1 Samuel 16:12

So he sent for him and brought him in.  
Now he was ruddy, with beautiful eyes and a handsome appearance.  
And the Lord said, “Arise, anoint him; for this is he.”

## 1 Samuel 16:13

Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers;  
and from that day onward, the Spirit of the Lord was powerfully with David.  
And Samuel got up and went to Ramah.

## 1 Samuel 16:14

At that time, the Spirit of the Lord withdrew from Saul,  
and a troubling spirit from the Lord began to distress him.

## 1 Samuel 16:15

Saul’s servants then said to him, “Behold now, an evil spirit from God is tormenting you.

## 1 Samuel 16:16

Let our lord now command your servants who are before you.  
Let them seek a man who is skilful in playing the harp;  
and when the evil spirit from God is upon you,  
he shall play, and you will be well.”

## 1 Samuel 16:17

So Saul instructed his servants, “Find me someone who can play well and bring him to me.”

## 1 Samuel 16:18

Then one of the young men answered and said,  
“Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is skilful in playing,  
a valiant man, a warrior, eloquent in speech, and a handsome man;  
and the Lord is with him.”

## 1 Samuel 16:19

So Saul sent messengers to Jesse with the request, “Send me your son David, who is with the flock.”

## 1 Samuel 16:20

And Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, a jug of wine, and a young goat,  
and sent them to Saul by David his son.

## 1 Samuel 16:21

Then David came to Saul and entered his service;  
and Saul loved him greatly, and he became his armour-bearer.

## 1 Samuel 16:22

And Saul sent word to Jesse, saying,  
“Let David now remain in my service, for he has found favour in my sight.”

## 1 Samuel 16:23

So it came about, whenever the evil spirit from God came upon Saul,  
David would take the harp and play it with his hand;  
and Saul would be refreshed and be well, and the evil spirit would leave him.
