# 1 Samuel Chapter 24

## 1 Samuel 24:1

Now when Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines,  
they told him, “Behold, David is in the wilderness of Engedi.”

## 1 Samuel 24:2

Then Saul took three thousand chosen men from all Israel and went to search for David and his men  
in front of the Rocks of the Wild Goats.

## 1 Samuel 24:3

He passed by the sheepfolds along the way, where there was a cave;  
and Saul entered to relieve himself.  
Now David and his men were sitting in the inner recesses of the cave.

## 1 Samuel 24:4

The men of David said to him,  
“Behold, this is the day of which the Lord said to you,  
‘Behold, I am about to hand your enemy over to you,  
and you shall do to him as it seems good to you.’”  
Then David got up and cut off the edge of Saul’s robe secretly.

## 1 Samuel 24:5

But afterward, David felt no joy
because he had cut off the edge of Saul’s robe.

## 1 Samuel 24:6

So he said to his men,  
“May it be far from me, because of the Lord, to do such a thing to my lord, the Lord’s anointed,  
to stretch out my hand against him, since he is the Lord’s anointed.”

## 1 Samuel 24:7

And David restrained his men with these words and did not allow them to rise up against Saul.  
And Saul got up, left the cave, and went on his way.

## 1 Samuel 24:8

Afterward David got up and went out of the cave, and called after Saul, saying,  
“My lord the king!”  
When Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the ground and prostrated himself.

## 1 Samuel 24:9

David said to Saul,  
“Why do you listen to the words of men who say, ‘Behold, David is seeking to harm you’?

## 1 Samuel 24:10

Behold, this day your eyes have seen that the Lord had handed you over to me today in the cave,  
and some said to kill you, but I spared you.  
And I said, ‘I will not reach out with my hand against my lord, for he is the Lord’s anointed.’

## 1 Samuel 24:11

So, my father, look! Indeed, look at the edge of your robe in my hand!  
For in that I cut off the edge of your robe but did not kill you,  
know and understand that there is no evil or rebellion in my hands,  
and I have not sinned against you, though you are intent on taking my life.

## 1 Samuel 24:12

May the Lord be the judge between you and me, and may He bring justice upon you;  
but my hand shall not be against you.

## 1 Samuel 24:13

As the ancient proverb says,

> ‘Out of the wicked comes wickedness’;  
> But my hand shall not be against you.

## 1 Samuel 24:14

After whom has the king of Israel come out?  
Whom are you pursuing? A mere dog, a single flea?

## 1 Samuel 24:15

May the Lord therefore be judge and decide between you and me;  
and may He see and uphold my cause and deliver me from your hand.”

## 1 Samuel 24:16

Now when David had finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul said,  
“Is this your voice, my son David?”  
Then Saul raised his voice and wept.

## 1 Samuel 24:17

And he said to David,  
“You are more righteous than I; for you have treated me well,  
while I have treated you maliciously.

## 1 Samuel 24:18

You have shown today that you have done good to me,  
that the Lord handed me over to you and yet you did not kill me.

## 1 Samuel 24:19

For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away safely?  
May the Lord reward you with good in return for what you have done for me this day.

## 1 Samuel 24:20

Now behold, I am aware that you will certainly be king,  
and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hand.

## 1 Samuel 24:21

So now swear to me by the Lord that you will not cut off my descendants after me,  
and that you will not erase my name from my father’s household.”

## 1 Samuel 24:22

And David swore to Saul.  
Then Saul went to his home,  
but David and his men went up to the stronghold.
