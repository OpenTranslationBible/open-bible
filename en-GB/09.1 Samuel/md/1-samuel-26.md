# 1 Samuel Chapter 26

## 1 Samuel 26:1

The Ziphites approached Saul at Gibeah and said,  
“Is David not keeping himself hidden on the hill of Hachilah, which is opposite Jeshimon?”

## 1 Samuel 26:2

Saul then set out and journeyed to the wilderness of Ziph,  
bringing with him three thousand chosen men of Israel,  
to search for David in the wilderness of Ziph.

## 1 Samuel 26:3

Saul camped on the hill of Hachilah, which is opposite Jeshimon, beside the road.  
But David was staying in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul had come after him into the wilderness.

## 1 Samuel 26:4

David sent out spies, and he learned for certain that Saul had indeed arrived.

## 1 Samuel 26:5

David then arose and came to the place where Saul had camped.  
And David saw the place where Saul was lying, and Abner the son of Ner, the commander of his army.  
Now Saul was lying in the inner circle of the camp, and the people were camped around him.

## 1 Samuel 26:6

David spoke to Ahimelech the Hittite and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, asking,  
“Who will accompany me to Saul in the camp?”  
And Abishai replied, “I will go down with you.”

## 1 Samuel 26:7

So David and Abishai came to the people by night,  
and behold, Saul was lying asleep inside the camp, with his spear stuck in the ground at his head.  
And Abner and the people were lying around him.

## 1 Samuel 26:8

Then Abishai said to David,  
“Today God has delivered your enemy into your hand;  
now then, please let me strike him with the spear to the ground with one thrust, and I will not need to strike him a second time.”

## 1 Samuel 26:9

But David replied to Abishai,  
“Do not kill him, for who can reach out against the Lord’s anointed and remain innocent?”

## 1 Samuel 26:10

David also said,  
“As the Lord lives, the Lord will surely strike him, or his day will come when he dies,  
or he will go down in battle and perish.

## 1 Samuel 26:11

The Lord forbid that I would reach out against the Lord’s anointed!  
But now, please take the spear that is at his head and the jug of water, and let us go.”

## 1 Samuel 26:12

So David took the spear and the jug of water from beside Saul’s head, and they went away.  
But no one saw it or knew it, nor did anyone wake up,  
for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from the Lord had fallen upon them.

## 1 Samuel 26:13

Then David crossed over to the other side and stood on top of the mountain at a distance;  
a large area was between them.

## 1 Samuel 26:14

And David called to the people and to Abner the son of Ner, saying,  
“Will you not answer, Abner?”  
Then Abner answered, “Who are you who calls to the king?”

## 1 Samuel 26:15

So David addressed Abner,  
“Are you not a man? And who is like you in Israel?  
Why then have you not protected your lord the king?  
For one of the people came to harm the king your lord.

## 1 Samuel 26:16

This thing that you have done is not good.  
As the Lord lives, you all must die, because you did not guard your lord, the Lord’s anointed.  
Now look and see where the king’s spear and the jug of water that were at his head are.”

## 1 Samuel 26:17

Then Saul recognised David’s voice and said,  
“Is this your voice, my son David?”  
And David said, “It is my voice, my lord the king.”

## 1 Samuel 26:18

He also said, “Why is my lord pursuing his servant?  
For what have I done, or what evil is in my hand?

## 1 Samuel 26:19

Now then, please let my lord the king listen to the words of his servant.  
If the Lord has incited you against me, may He accept an offering;  
but if it is people, cursed are they before the Lord,  
for they have driven me out today so that I would have no share in the inheritance of the Lord, saying,  
‘Go, serve other gods.’

## 1 Samuel 26:20

Therefore, do not let my blood fall to the ground away from the presence of the Lord,  
for the king of Israel has come out to search for a single flea,  
just as one hunts a partridge in the mountains.”

## 1 Samuel 26:21

Then Saul said,  
“I have sinned. Return, my son David, for I will not harm you again,  
because my life was precious in your sight this day.  
Behold, I have played the fool and have made a terrible mistake.”

## 1 Samuel 26:22

David replied and said,  
“Behold, the spear of the king!  
Now have one of the young men come over and take it.

## 1 Samuel 26:23

And the Lord will repay each man for his righteousness and his faithfulness;  
for the Lord delivered you into my hands today,  
but I refused to reach out against the Lord’s anointed.

## 1 Samuel 26:24

Now behold, just as your life was highly valued in my sight this day,  
so may my life be highly valued in the sight of the Lord, and may He rescue me from all distress.”

## 1 Samuel 26:25

Then Saul said to David,  
“Blessed are you, my son David; you will both accomplish much and will certainly prevail.”  
So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.
