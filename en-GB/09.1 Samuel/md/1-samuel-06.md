# 1 Samuel Chapter 6

## 1 Samuel 6:1

The Ark of the Lord was kept in Philistine territory for seven months.

## 1 Samuel 6:2

Then the Philistines called for the priests and diviners and said, “What should we do with the ark of the Lord? Tell us how we should send it back to its place.”

## 1 Samuel 6:3

They answered, “If you return the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it back empty, but be sure to send a guilt offering with it. Then you will be healed, and you will understand why His hand has not turned away from you.”

## 1 Samuel 6:4

The Philistines asked, “What guilt offering should we send to Him?”  
They replied, “Five gold tumours and five gold rats, according to the number of the Philistine rulers, because the same plague struck all of you and your rulers.

## 1 Samuel 6:5

So make models of the tumours and the rats that are ravaging your land, and give honour to the God of Israel. Perhaps He will lift His hand from you, your gods, and your land.

## 1 Samuel 6:6

Why do you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh did? After He dealt harshly with them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?

## 1 Samuel 6:7

Now then, make a new cart and take two cows that have recently calved and have never been yoked. Hitch the cows to the cart, but take their calves away and pen them up.

## 1 Samuel 6:8

Then put the ark of the Lord on the cart and place in a box beside it the gold objects you are sending as a guilt offering. Send it off, and let it go on its way.

## 1 Samuel 6:9

Watch to see what it does. If it goes up toward its own land, to Beth-shemesh, then the Lord has brought this disaster on us. But if it does not, then we shall know that it was not His hand that struck us—it happened by chance.”

## 1 Samuel 6:10

So they did as instructed. They took two cows and hitched them to the cart, and they confined their calves at home.

## 1 Samuel 6:11

They placed the ark of the Lord on the cart, along with the box containing the gold rats and the models of their tumours.

## 1 Samuel 6:12

Then the cows went straight toward Beth-shemesh, keeping to the road and lowing as they went. They did not turn to the right or the left.  
The rulers of the Philistines followed them as far as the border of Beth-shemesh.

## 1 Samuel 6:13

Now the people of Beth-shemesh were harvesting wheat in the valley. When they looked up and saw the ark, they rejoiced at the sight.

## 1 Samuel 6:14

The cart came to the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh and stopped beside a large stone. The people chopped up the wood of the cart and sacrificed the cows as a burnt offering to the Lord.

## 1 Samuel 6:15

The Levites took down the ark of the Lord and the box beside it containing the gold objects, and they placed them on the large stone.  
That day the people of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices to the Lord.

## 1 Samuel 6:16

When the five rulers of the Philistines saw this, they returned to Ekron that same day.

---

## 1 Samuel 6:17

These are the gold tumours the Philistines sent as a guilt offering to the Lord—one each for Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron.

## 1 Samuel 6:18

And the gold rats were according to the number of all the Philistine towns belonging to the five rulers, both fortified and rural. The large stone on which the Levites placed the ark of the Lord is a witness to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh.

## 1 Samuel 6:19

But God struck down some of the men of Beth-shemesh because they looked into the ark of the Lord. He put seventy of them to death, and the people mourned because the Lord had dealt them a severe blow.

## 1 Samuel 6:20

And the men of Beth-shemesh said, “Who can stand in the presence of the Lord, this holy God? To whom shall the ark go from here?”

## 1 Samuel 6:21

So they sent messengers to the people of Kiriath-jearim, saying, “The Philistines have returned the ark of the Lord. Come down and take it up to you.”
