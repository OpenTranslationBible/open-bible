# 2 Corinthians Chapter 5

## 2 Corinthians 5:1

For we understand that if our earthly dwelling, which is our home, is dismantled, we have a building from God, a home not crafted by human hands, eternal in the heavens.

## 2 Corinthians 5:2

For truly, in this dwelling we groan, yearning to be clothed with our heavenly abode,

## 2 Corinthians 5:3

Since indeed, once clothed, we will not be found without covering.

## 2 Corinthians 5:4

For truly, we who are in this dwelling groan, feeling burdened, because we do not wish to be without covering but to be clothed, so that what is mortal may be enveloped by life.

## 2 Corinthians 5:5

Now it is God who has prepared us for this very purpose, who has given us the Spirit as a guarantee.

## 2 Corinthians 5:6

Therefore, always being of good courage, and recognising that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord—

## 2 Corinthians 5:7

For we walk by faith, not by sight—

## 2 Corinthians 5:8

Yet we are of good courage and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord.

## 2 Corinthians 5:9

Therefore we also make it our aim, whether at home or away, to be pleasing to Him.

## 2 Corinthians 5:10

For we must all appear before the judgement seat of Christ, so that each one may receive compensation for his deeds done through the body, in accordance with what he has done, whether good or bad.

## 2 Corinthians 5:11

Therefore, knowing the reverence of the Lord, we persuade people, but we are fully known to God; and I hope that we are also fully known in your consciences.

## 2 Corinthians 5:12

We are not recommending ourselves to you again, but are providing you with an opportunity to be proud of us, so that you will have a response for those who take pride in outward appearance and not in the heart.

## 2 Corinthians 5:13

For if we appear to have lost our senses, it is for God; if we are of sound mind, it is for you.

## 2 Corinthians 5:14

For the love of Christ compels us, having concluded this: that one died for all, therefore all died;

## 2 Corinthians 5:15

And He died for all, so that those who live might no longer live for themselves, but for Him who died and rose again on their behalf.

## 2 Corinthians 5:16

Therefore from now on we regard no one according to the flesh; even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him in this way no longer.

## 2 Corinthians 5:17

Therefore if anyone is in Christ, that person is a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold, new things have come.

## 2 Corinthians 5:18

Now all these things are from God, who reconciled us to Himself through Christ and entrusted us with the ministry of reconciliation,

## 2 Corinthians 5:19

That is, God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not counting their wrongdoings against them, and He has entrusted to us the message of reconciliation.

## 2 Corinthians 5:20

Therefore, we are representatives for Christ, as though God were making an appeal through us; we implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.

## 2 Corinthians 5:21

He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.
