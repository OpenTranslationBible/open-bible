# 2 Corinthians Chapter 11

## 2 Corinthians 11:1

I hope you will bear with me in a bit of foolishness; indeed, you are already doing so.

## 2 Corinthians 11:2

For I am deeply concerned for you with a godly concern; for I have pledged you to one husband, to present you as a pure bride to Christ.

## 2 Corinthians 11:3

But I am afraid that, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, your minds will be led astray from sincere and pure devotion to Christ.

## 2 Corinthians 11:4

For if one comes and preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached, or you receive a different spirit which you have not received, or a different gospel which you have not accepted, you tolerate this very well!

## 2 Corinthians 11:5

For I do not consider myself in any way inferior to these most eminent apostles.

## 2 Corinthians 11:6

But even if I lack skill in speaking, I am not lacking in knowledge; in fact, in every way we have made this clear to you in all things.

## 2 Corinthians 11:7

Or did I commit a wrong by lowering myself so that you might be elevated, because I preached the gospel of God to you free of charge?

## 2 Corinthians 11:8

I took support from other churches, accepting their aid to serve you;

## 2 Corinthians 11:9

And when I was with you and in need, I did not burden anyone; for when the brothers came from Macedonia, they fully supplied my need, and in everything I kept myself from being a burden to you, and will continue to do so.

## 2 Corinthians 11:10

With the truth of Christ within me, I declare that this boasting of mine will not be silenced in the regions of Achaia.

## 2 Corinthians 11:11

Why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!

## 2 Corinthians 11:12

But what I am doing I will continue to do, so that I may eliminate the opportunity from those who want an opportunity to be regarded just as we are in the matter about which they are boasting.

## 2 Corinthians 11:13

For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, masquerading as apostles of Christ.

## 2 Corinthians 11:14

No wonder, for even Satan masquerades as an angel of light.

## 2 Corinthians 11:15

Therefore it is not surprising if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their deeds.

## 2 Corinthians 11:16

Again I say, let no one think me foolish; but if you do, accept me even as foolish, so that I also may boast a little.

## 2 Corinthians 11:17

What I am saying, I do not say as the Lord would, but rather in a spirit of foolishness, with this confidence of boasting.

## 2 Corinthians 11:18

Since many boast according to worldly standards, I will boast also.

## 2 Corinthians 11:19

For you, being so wise, endure the foolish gladly.

## 2 Corinthians 11:20

For you tolerate it if anyone enslaves you, consumes you, takes advantage of you, exalts himself, or strikes you in the face.

## 2 Corinthians 11:21

To my regret, I must admit that we have been weak by comparison. But in whatever respect anyone else is bold—I am speaking in foolishness—I too am bold.

## 2 Corinthians 11:22

Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I.

## 2 Corinthians 11:23

Are they servants of Christ?—I speak as if out of my mind—I more so: in far more labours, in far more imprisonments, beaten times without number, often in danger of death.

## 2 Corinthians 11:24

Five times I received from the Jewish authorities the forty lashes minus one.

## 2 Corinthians 11:25

On three occasions I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, and three times I was shipwrecked; I spent a night and a day adrift at sea.

## 2 Corinthians 11:26

I have been on frequent journeys, in dangers from rivers, dangers from robbers, dangers from my own people, dangers from the Gentiles, dangers in the city, dangers in the wilderness, dangers at sea, dangers among false brothers;

## 2 Corinthians 11:27

I have been in labour and hardship, through many sleepless nights, in hunger and thirst, often without food, in cold and exposure.

## 2 Corinthians 11:28

Apart from such external matters, there is the daily pressure on me of concern for all the churches.

## 2 Corinthians 11:29

Who is weak without my sharing in that weakness? Who is led into sin without my intense concern?

## 2 Corinthians 11:30

If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness.

## 2 Corinthians 11:31

The God and Father of our Lord Jesus, who is eternally blessed, knows that I am not lying.

## 2 Corinthians 11:32

In Damascus, the governor under King Aretas was guarding the city of the Damascenes to capture me,

## 2 Corinthians 11:33

and I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall, and thus escaped his hands.
