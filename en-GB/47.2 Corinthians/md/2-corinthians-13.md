# 2 Corinthians Chapter 13

## 2 Corinthians 13:1

This is the third time I am coming to you. Every matter is to be confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses.

## 2 Corinthians 13:2

I previously said when present the second time, and though now absent I say in advance to those who have sinned in the past and to all the rest as well, that if I come again I will not spare anyone,

## 2 Corinthians 13:3

Since you are looking for evidence of Christ speaking through me, who is not weak among you, but powerful within you.

## 2 Corinthians 13:4

For indeed He was crucified in weakness, yet He lives by the power of God. We too are weak in Him, yet we will live with Him by the power of God directed toward you.

## 2 Corinthians 13:5

Test yourselves to see if you are in the faith; examine yourselves! Or do you not recognise this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in youâ€”unless indeed you fail the test?

## 2 Corinthians 13:6

But I expect that you will realise that we ourselves do not fail the test.

## 2 Corinthians 13:7

Now we pray to God that you do nothing wrong; not so that we appear to have passed the test, but that you may do what is right, even though we may appear to have failed.

## 2 Corinthians 13:8

For we are unable to do anything against the truth, we only work for the truth.

## 2 Corinthians 13:9

For we rejoice when we ourselves are weak but you are strong; this we also pray for, that you become fully mature.

## 2 Corinthians 13:10

For this reason I am writing these things while absent, so that when present I need not be severe, in line with the authority which the Lord gave me for building up, and not for tearing down.

## 2 Corinthians 13:11

Finally, brothers and sisters, rejoice, aim for restoration, be encouraged, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you.

## 2 Corinthians 13:12

Greet one another warmly with a holy kiss.

## 2 Corinthians 13:13

All the believers send their greetings to you.

## 2 Corinthians 13:14

May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all, evermore.
