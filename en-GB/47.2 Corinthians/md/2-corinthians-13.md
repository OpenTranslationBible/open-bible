# 2 Corinthians Chapter 13

## 2 Corinthians 13:1

This is the third time I am coming to you. Every matter is to be confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses.

## 2 Corinthians 13:2

I previously said when present the second time, and though now absent I say in advance to those who have sinned in the past and to all the rest as well, that if I come again I will not spare anyone,

## 2 Corinthians 13:3

Since you are seeking proof of the Christ who speaks in me, who is not weak toward you, but mighty in you.

## 2 Corinthians 13:4

For indeed He was crucified because of weakness, yet He lives because of the power of God. For we also are weak in Him, yet we will live with Him because of the power of God directed toward you.

## 2 Corinthians 13:5

Test yourselves to see if you are in the faith; examine yourselves! Or do you not Recognise this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in youâ€”unless indeed you fail the test?

## 2 Corinthians 13:6

But I expect that you will realise that we ourselves do not fail the test.

## 2 Corinthians 13:7

Now we pray to God that you do nothing wrong; not so that we appear to have passed the test, but that you may do what is right, even though we may appear to have failed.

## 2 Corinthians 13:8

For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth.

## 2 Corinthians 13:9

For we rejoice when we ourselves are weak but you are strong; this we also pray for, that you become fully mature.

## 2 Corinthians 13:10

For this reason I am writing these things while absent, so that when present I need not use severity, in accordance with the authority which the Lord gave me for building up, and not for tearing down.

## 2 Corinthians 13:11

Finally, brothers and sisters, rejoice, mend your ways, be comforted, be like-minded, live in peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you.

## 2 Corinthians 13:12

Greet one another with a holy kiss.

## 2 Corinthians 13:13

All the saints greet you.

## 2 Corinthians 13:14

The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all.
