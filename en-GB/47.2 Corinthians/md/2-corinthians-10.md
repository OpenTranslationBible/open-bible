# 2 Corinthians Chapter 10

## 2 Corinthians 10:1

I, Paul, appeal to you with the humility and gentleness of Christ—I who am humble when present with you, but bold when away!

## 2 Corinthians 10:2

I hope that when I am with you, I will not need to be as bold as I plan to be towards some who think we live by the standards of this world.

## 2 Corinthians 10:3

For though we live in the world, we do not fight as the world does,

## 2 Corinthians 10:4

since the weapons we use in our warfare are not of this world, but have divine power to demolish strongholds.

## 2 Corinthians 10:5

We dismantle arguments and every pretension that opposes the knowledge of God, and we take every thought captive to make it obedient to Christ,

## 2 Corinthians 10:6

and we are prepared to punish every act of disobedience, once your obedience is complete.

## 2 Corinthians 10:7

You are making judgments based on appearances. If anyone is confident that they belong to Christ, they should reconsider that we belong to Christ just as much as they do.

## 2 Corinthians 10:8

Even if I boast somewhat freely about the authority the Lord gave us for building you up rather than tearing you down, I will not be ashamed of it,

## 2 Corinthians 10:9

so that I may not seem as if I am trying to frighten you with my letters.

## 2 Corinthians 10:10

For some say, “His letters are weighty and forceful, but in person he lacks presence and his speaking is of little account.”

## 2 Corinthians 10:11

Such people should understand that what we are in our letters when absent, we will be in our actions when present.

## 2 Corinthians 10:12

We do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves. When they measure themselves by their own standards and compare themselves with themselves, they lack wisdom.

## 2 Corinthians 10:13

We, however, will not boast beyond proper limits, but will confine our boasting to the sphere of service God himself has assigned to us, a sphere that also includes you.

## 2 Corinthians 10:14

We are not overstepping in our boasting, as would be the case if we had not come to you, for we did reach you with the gospel of Christ.

## 2 Corinthians 10:15

Neither do we exceed our limits by boasting of work done by others. Our hope is that, as your faith continues to grow, our sphere of activity among you will greatly expand,

## 2 Corinthians 10:16

so that we can preach the gospel in the regions beyond you. For we do not wish to boast about work already accomplished in someone else’s territory.

## 2 Corinthians 10:17

But, “Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.”

## 2 Corinthians 10:18

For it is not the one who praises himself who is approved, but the one whom the Lord praises.
