# 2 Corinthians Chapter 9

## 2 Corinthians 9:1

For it is unnecessary for me to write to you about this service to the saints;

## 2 Corinthians 9:2

For I am aware of your eagerness, which I have mentioned to the Macedonians, saying that Achaia has been ready since last year, and your enthusiasm has inspired most of them.

## 2 Corinthians 9:3

But I have sent the brothers, so that our boasting about you may not be made empty in this case, so that, as I was saying, you will be prepared;

## 2 Corinthians 9:4

Otherwise, if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we—not to mention you—would be put to shame in this confidence.

## 2 Corinthians 9:5

So I considered it necessary to urge the brothers that they go on ahead to you and arrange in advance your previously promised generous gift, so that it would be ready as a generous gift, and not as one grudgingly given due to greediness.

## 2 Corinthians 9:6

Now I say this: whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously.

## 2 Corinthians 9:7

Each person should give as they have decided in their heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.

## 2 Corinthians 9:8

And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that, always having all sufficiency in everything, you may excel in every good deed;

## 2 Corinthians 9:9

As the scripture says:

> “He scattered abroad, he gave to the poor,  
> His righteousness endures forever.”

## 2 Corinthians 9:10

Now He who provides seed to the sower and bread for food will provide and multiply your seed for sowing and enhance the harvest of your righteousness;

## 2 Corinthians 9:11

You will be enriched in every way for all generosity, which through us results in thanksgiving to God.

## 2 Corinthians 9:12

For the ministry of this service is not only fully meeting the needs of the saints, but is also overflowing through many thanksgivings to God.

## 2 Corinthians 9:13

Because of the proof given by this ministry, they will glorify God for your obedience to your confession of the gospel of Christ, and for the generosity of your contribution to them and to all;

## 2 Corinthians 9:14

While they also, through prayer for you, long for you because of the extraordinary grace of God in you.

## 2 Corinthians 9:15

Praise be to God for His gift beyond words!
