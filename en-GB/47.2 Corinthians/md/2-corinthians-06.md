# 2 Corinthians Chapter 6

## 2 Corinthians 6:1

And as we work together with Him, we also encourage you not to receive the grace of God to no purpose—

## 2 Corinthians 6:2

For He says,

> “At a favourable time I listened to you,  
> And on a day of salvation I helped you.”  
> Behold, now is “a favourable time,” behold, now is “a day of salvation”—

## 2 Corinthians 6:3

Giving no reason for taking offence in anything, so that the ministry will not be discredited,

## 2 Corinthians 6:4

But in all things, we present ourselves as servants of God, with much endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in difficulties,

## 2 Corinthians 6:5

In beatings, in imprisonments, in mob attacks, in labours, in sleeplessness, in hunger,

## 2 Corinthians 6:6

With purity, with knowledge, with patience, with kindness, with the Holy Spirit, with sincere love,

## 2 Corinthians 6:7

With the word of truth, and with the power of God; by the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and the left,

## 2 Corinthians 6:8

By glory and dishonour, by evil report and good report; regarded as deceivers and yet true;

## 2 Corinthians 6:9

As unknown and yet well known, as dying and yet behold, we live; as punished and yet not put to death,

## 2 Corinthians 6:10

As sorrowful yet always finding joy, as poor yet bringing richness to many, as having nothing and yet possessing everything.

## 2 Corinthians 6:11

Our mouth has spoken freely to you, Corinthians, our heart is opened wide.

## 2 Corinthians 6:12

It is not us who limit you, but rather your own affections that constrain you.

## 2 Corinthians 6:13

Now in the same way in exchange—I am speaking as to children—open your hearts wide also.

## 2 Corinthians 6:14

Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers; for what do righteousness and lawlessness have in common, or what does light share with darkness?

## 2 Corinthians 6:15

Or what accord does Christ have with Belial, or what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever?

## 2 Corinthians 6:16

Or what agreement could be found between the temple of God and idols? We are the temple of the living God; as God has declared:

> “I will dwell among them and walk among them;  
> And I will be their God, and they shall be My people.

## 2 Corinthians 6:17

Therefore,

> come out from among them and be separate,” says the Lord.  
> “And do not touch what is impure;  
> And I will receive you.

## 2 Corinthians 6:18

And

> I will be a father to you,  
> And you shall be My sons and daughters,”  
> Declares the Lord Almighty.
