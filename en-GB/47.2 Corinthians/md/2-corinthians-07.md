# 2 Corinthians Chapter 7

## 2 Corinthians 7:1

Therefore, since we have these promises, dear friends, let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit, striving for holiness out of reverence for God.

## 2 Corinthians 7:2

Open your hearts to us. We have wronged no one, corrupted no one, and taken advantage of no one.

## 2 Corinthians 7:3

I am not saying this to condemn you, for I have mentioned before that you are in our hearts, to share both death and life together.

## 2 Corinthians 7:4

My confidence in you is great; my pride in you is immense. I am filled with comfort; I am overflowing with joy despite all our troubles.

## 2 Corinthians 7:5

For even when we arrived in Macedonia, we found no rest for our bodies, but we were troubled on every side: conflicts on the outside, fears within.

## 2 Corinthians 7:6

But God, who encourages the downcast, encouraged us by the coming of Titus;

## 2 Corinthians 7:7

And not only by his coming, but also by the encouragement he received from you, as he told us about your longing, your mourning, your enthusiasm for me; so that I was even more joyful.

## 2 Corinthians 7:8

For though I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it; though I did regret it—because I see that the letter caused you sorrow, though only for a while—

## 2 Corinthians 7:9

I now rejoice, not because you were made sorrowful, but because your sorrow led to repentance; for you were made sorrowful in a way that aligns with God's will, so that you suffered no loss from us.

## 2 Corinthians 7:10

For the sorrow that aligns with God's will brings a repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death.

## 2 Corinthians 7:11

For behold what earnestness this very thing—this godly sorrow—has produced in you: what vindication of yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, what correction of wrong! In everything you demonstrated yourselves to be innocent in the matter.

## 2 Corinthians 7:12

So although I wrote to you, it was not for the sake of the offender nor for the sake of the one offended, but so that your earnestness on our behalf would be revealed to you in the sight of God.

## 2 Corinthians 7:13

For this reason we have been comforted. And besides our own comfort, we rejoiced even much more for the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all.

## 2 Corinthians 7:14

For if I have boasted to him about you in anything, I was not put to shame; but as we spoke all things to you in truth, so also our boasting before Titus proved to be the truth.

## 2 Corinthians 7:15

His affection for you grows all the more, as he remembers the obedience of you all, how you received him with respect and humility.

## 2 Corinthians 7:16

I am glad that in everything I have confidence in you.
