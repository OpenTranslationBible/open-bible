# 2 Corinthians Chapter 12

## 2 Corinthians 12:1

Though it is not beneficial, I must continue with visions and revelations of the Lord.

## 2 Corinthians 12:2

I know of a man in Christ who, fourteen years ago—whether in the body or out of the body, I do not know, only God knows—was caught up to the third heaven.

## 2 Corinthians 12:3

And I know that this man—whether in the body or apart from the body, I do not know, only God knows—

## 2 Corinthians 12:4

was taken up into Paradise and heard words beyond expression, which no one is allowed to speak.

## 2 Corinthians 12:5

On behalf of such a man, I will boast; but on my own behalf, I will not boast, except regarding my weaknesses.

## 2 Corinthians 12:6

If I choose to boast, I will not be foolish, for I would be speaking the truth; but I refrain, so that no one will credit me with more than what they see in me or hear from me.

## 2 Corinthians 12:7

Because of the extraordinary greatness of the revelations, to prevent me from becoming conceited, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan to torment me—to keep me from becoming conceited!

## 2 Corinthians 12:8

Regarding this, I pleaded with the Lord three times that it might depart from me.

## 2 Corinthians 12:9

And He has said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for power is perfected in weakness.” Most gladly, therefore, I will boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me.

## 2 Corinthians 12:10

Therefore, I take pleasure in weaknesses, in insults, in distresses, in persecutions, in difficulties, for the sake of Christ; for when I am weak, then I am strong.

## 2 Corinthians 12:11

I have become foolish; you compelled me. Indeed, I should have been commended by you, since I was in no way inferior to the most eminent apostles, even though I am nothing.

## 2 Corinthians 12:12

The signs of a true apostle were performed among you with all perseverance, through signs, wonders, and miracles.

## 2 Corinthians 12:13

In what way were you treated as inferior to the other churches, except that I myself did not become a burden to you? Please forgive me for this wrong!

## 2 Corinthians 12:14

For the third time, I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you; for I seek not what is yours, but you. For children are not obligated to save up for their parents, but parents for their children.

## 2 Corinthians 12:15

I will most gladly spend and be expended for your souls. If I love you more, should I be loved less?

## 2 Corinthians 12:16

Even so, I did not burden you myself; nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you by trickery.

## 2 Corinthians 12:17

Surely, I have not taken advantage of you through any of those whom I have sent to you, have I?

## 2 Corinthians 12:18

I encouraged Titus to visit, and I sent the brother with him. Titus did not take any advantage of you, did he? Did we not conduct ourselves with the same spirit and follow the same path?

## 2 Corinthians 12:19

All this time, you have been thinking that we are defending ourselves to you. In truth, it is in the sight of God that we have been speaking in Christ; and all for your edification, beloved.

## 2 Corinthians 12:20

For I fear that when I come, I may not find you as I wish, and you may not find me as you wish; that perhaps there will be strife, jealousy, angry tempers, selfishness, slander, gossip, arrogance, disturbances;

## 2 Corinthians 12:21

I fear that when I come again, my God may humble me before you, and I may mourn over many of those who have sinned in the past and not repented of the impurity, sexual immorality, and indecent behaviour which they have practiced.
