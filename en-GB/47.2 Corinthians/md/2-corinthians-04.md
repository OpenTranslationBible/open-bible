# 2 Corinthians Chapter 4

## 2 Corinthians 4:1

Thus, since we have this ministry, through the mercy we have received, we do not lose heart,

## 2 Corinthians 4:2

But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in deceit nor altering the word of God, but by openly declaring the truth, we commend ourselves to every person’s conscience in the sight of God.

## 2 Corinthians 4:3

And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing,

## 2 Corinthians 4:4

In whose case the god of this age has blinded the minds of the unbelieving, so they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.

## 2 Corinthians 4:5

For we do not proclaim ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake.

## 2 Corinthians 4:6

For God, who said, “Light shall shine out of darkness,” is the One who has illuminated our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.

## 2 Corinthians 4:7

But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, so that the surpassing greatness of the power may be of God and not from ourselves;

## 2 Corinthians 4:8

We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair;

## 2 Corinthians 4:9

Persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed;

## 2 Corinthians 4:10

Always carrying in the body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body.

## 2 Corinthians 4:11

For we who live are continually being delivered to death for Jesus' sake, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our mortal flesh.

## 2 Corinthians 4:12

So death is at work in us, but life in you.

## 2 Corinthians 4:13

Yet having the same spirit of faith, according to what is written: “I believed, therefore I spoke,” we also believe, and therefore we also speak,

## 2 Corinthians 4:14

Aware that the One who raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us with Jesus and will present us together with you.

## 2 Corinthians 4:15

For all things are for your benefit, so that grace, having spread to more and more people, may cause thanksgiving to overflow to the glory of God.

## 2 Corinthians 4:16

Therefore we do not lose heart, but though our outer self is wasting away, yet our inner self is being renewed day by day.

## 2 Corinthians 4:17

For our momentary, light affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison,

## 2 Corinthians 4:18

While we focus not on the things which are seen, but on the things which are unseen; for the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are unseen are eternal.
