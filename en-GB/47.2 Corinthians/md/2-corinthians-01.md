# 2 Corinthians Chapter 1

## 2 Corinthians 1:1

Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,  
To the church of God which is at Corinth with all the saints who are throughout Achaia:

## 2 Corinthians 1:2

Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

## 2 Corinthians 1:3

Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort,

## 2 Corinthians 1:4

Who consoles us in all our troubles, enabling us to console those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from God.

## 2 Corinthians 1:5

For just as we share abundantly in the sufferings of Christ, so through Christ our comfort overflows.

## 2 Corinthians 1:6

But if we face troubles, it is for your comfort and salvation; or if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which helps you patiently endure the same sufferings we experience;

## 2 Corinthians 1:7

And our hope for you is unwavering, knowing that as you partake in our sufferings, so also you partake in our comfort.

## 2 Corinthians 1:8

For we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers and sisters, about the troubles we faced in Asia, where we were burdened beyond our ability to endure, so much so that we despaired even of life.

## 2 Corinthians 1:9

Indeed, we felt we had received the sentence of death, so that we might not rely on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead;

## 2 Corinthians 1:10

Who delivered us from such a perilous danger of death, and will continue to deliver us. On Him we have set our hope, and He will yet deliver us,

## 2 Corinthians 1:11

If you also join in helping us through your prayers, so that thanks may be given by many persons on our behalf for the favour bestowed on us through the prayers of many.

## 2 Corinthians 1:12

For our pride is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and godly sincerity, not in worldly wisdom but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and especially toward you.

## 2 Corinthians 1:13

For we write nothing else to you than what you read and understand, and I hope you will understand fully,

## 2 Corinthians 1:14

Just as you also partially did understand us, that we are your reason for pride as you also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus.

## 2 Corinthians 1:15

In this confidence I initially intended to visit you, so that you might be blessed twice;

## 2 Corinthians 1:16

That is, to pass your way into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and by you to be helped on my way to Judea.

## 2 Corinthians 1:17

Therefore, I was not indecisive when I intended to do this, was I? Or what I plan, do I plan according to human standards, so that with me there will be both “Yes, yes” and “No, no”?

## 2 Corinthians 1:18

But as God is faithful, our message to you is not a mixture of “Yes and no.”

## 2 Corinthians 1:19

For the Son of God, Christ Jesus, who was proclaimed among you by us—by me and Silvanus and Timothy—was not a mixture of “Yes and no,” but has always been “Yes” in Him.

## 2 Corinthians 1:20

For all the promises of God find their “Yes” in Him; therefore through Him we utter our “Amen” to the glory of God.

## 2 Corinthians 1:21

It is God who establishes both us and you in Christ. He has anointed us,

## 2 Corinthians 1:22

Who also set His seal of ownership on us and put His Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.

## 2 Corinthians 1:23

But I call God as my witness, that it was to spare you that I did not return to Corinth.

## 2 Corinthians 1:24

Not that we have dominion over your faith, but we work with you for your joy; for by faith you stand firm.
