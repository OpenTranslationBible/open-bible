# 2 Corinthians Chapter 8

## 2 Corinthians 8:1

Dear brothers and sisters, we wish to share with you the grace of God that has been bestowed upon the churches of Macedonia,

## 2 Corinthians 8:2

That during a severe trial of affliction, their abundant joy and profound poverty overflowed into a wealth of generosity.

## 2 Corinthians 8:3

For I can testify that according to their means, and even beyond their means, they gave willingly,

## 2 Corinthians 8:4

Begging us with much urging for the favour of participation in the support of the saints,

## 2 Corinthians 8:5

And this, beyond what we had anticipated, for they first dedicated themselves to the Lord and to us in accordance with God's will.

## 2 Corinthians 8:6

So we encouraged Titus that as he had previously initiated this, he would also bring to completion this gracious work among you.

## 2 Corinthians 8:7

But just as you excel in everything—in faith, word, knowledge, in all earnestness, and in the love we inspired in you—see that you also excel in this gracious work.

## 2 Corinthians 8:8

I am not issuing this as a command, but as a means to test the sincerity of your love through the earnestness of others.

## 2 Corinthians 8:9

For you are aware of the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that although He was rich, for your benefit He embraced poverty, so that by His poverty you might become rich.

## 2 Corinthians 8:10

I offer my opinion in this matter, for it is to your benefit, you who were the first to begin a year ago not only to do this, but also to desire to do it.

## 2 Corinthians 8:11

But now finish doing it also, so that just as there was the willingness to do it, so there may also be the completion of it by your ability.

## 2 Corinthians 8:12

For if the willingness is there, it is acceptable according to what a person has, not according to what they do not have.

## 2 Corinthians 8:13

For this is not intended to ease others and burden you, but as a matter of fairness—

## 2 Corinthians 8:14

At this present time your abundance will meet their need, so that their abundance may also meet your need, leading to fairness;

## 2 Corinthians 8:15

As the scripture says: “The one who collected much did not have too much, and the one who collected little did not have too little.”

## 2 Corinthians 8:16

But thanks be to God who instills the same earnestness for you in the heart of Titus.

## 2 Corinthians 8:17

For he not only accepted our request, but being very earnest himself, he has gone to you willingly.

## 2 Corinthians 8:18

We have sent along with him the brother whose reputation in the matters of the gospel has spread throughout all the churches;

## 2 Corinthians 8:19

And not only that, but he has also been appointed by the churches to travel with us in this gracious work, which is being managed by us for the glory of the Lord Himself, and to demonstrate our readiness,

## 2 Corinthians 8:20

Taking care so that no one will discredit us in our handling of this generous gift;

## 2 Corinthians 8:21

For we are concerned with what is honourable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of people.

## 2 Corinthians 8:22

We have sent with them our brother, whom we have often tested and found diligent in many things, but now even more so due to his great confidence in you.

## 2 Corinthians 8:23

Regarding Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker among you; as for our brothers, they are messengers of the churches, a glory to Christ.

## 2 Corinthians 8:24

Therefore, before all the churches, demonstrate to them the evidence of your love and the reason for our pride in you.
