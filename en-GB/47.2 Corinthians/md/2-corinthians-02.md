# 2 Corinthians Chapter 2

## 2 Corinthians 2:1

But I resolved for my own sake, that I would not visit you in sorrow again.

## 2 Corinthians 2:2

For if I bring you sorrow, who then will make me glad except the one who is saddened by me?

## 2 Corinthians 2:3

This is precisely what I wrote to you, so that when I arrived, I would not have sorrow from those who ought to bring me joy; having confidence in you all that my joy would be shared by you all.

## 2 Corinthians 2:4

For out of much distress and heartache, I wrote to you with many tears; not to cause you sorrow, but so that you might understand the love I have especially for you.

## 2 Corinthians 2:5

But if anyone has caused distress, he has not caused it for me, but to some extent—not to overstate it—for all of you.

## 2 Corinthians 2:6

Adequate for such a person is this penalty which was imposed by the majority,

## 2 Corinthians 2:7

So that on the contrary you should rather forgive and comfort him, otherwise such a person might be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.

## 2 Corinthians 2:8

Thus, I urge you to reaffirm your love for him.

## 2 Corinthians 2:9

For this purpose I also wrote, to test you, whether you are obedient in all things.

## 2 Corinthians 2:10

But anyone you forgive, I also forgive; for indeed what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, I did so for your benefit in the presence of Christ,

## 2 Corinthians 2:11

So that we would not be outwitted by Satan, for we are aware of his schemes.

## 2 Corinthians 2:12

Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ and when an opportunity was opened for me in the Lord,

## 2 Corinthians 2:13

I found no rest for my spirit, not finding Titus my brother; so I bid them farewell and went on to Macedonia.

## 2 Corinthians 2:14

But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of Him in every place.

## 2 Corinthians 2:15

For we are a pleasing aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing:

## 2 Corinthians 2:16

To some, an aroma from death to death, to others, an aroma from life to life. And who is sufficient for these things?

## 2 Corinthians 2:17

For we are not like many, peddling the word of God, but as from sincerity, as from God, we speak in Christ in the sight of God.
