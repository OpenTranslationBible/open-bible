# 2 Corinthians Chapter 3

## 2 Corinthians 3:1

Do we begin to praise ourselves again? Or do we require, as some do, letters of endorsement to you or from you?

## 2 Corinthians 3:2

You are our letter, inscribed in our hearts, recognised and understood by everyone;

## 2 Corinthians 3:3

Revealing yourselves as a letter of Christ, delivered by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.

## 2 Corinthians 3:4

This is the assurance we have in God through Christ.

## 2 Corinthians 3:5

Not that we are sufficient in ourselves to claim anything as originating from us, but our sufficiency is from God,

## 2 Corinthians 3:6

Who also made us competent as ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter brings death, but the Spirit imparts life.

## 2 Corinthians 3:7

But if the ministry that brought death, engraved in letters on stones, came with glory so that the sons of Israel could not gaze steadily at the face of Moses because of the glory of his face, which was fading,

## 2 Corinthians 3:8

How will the ministry of the Spirit not be even more glorious?

## 2 Corinthians 3:9

For if the ministry that brought condemnation had glory, much more does the ministry that brings righteousness abound in glory.

## 2 Corinthians 3:10

For what was once glorious now has no glory in comparison to the surpassing glory.

## 2 Corinthians 3:11

For if that which was fading away was with glory, much more that which remains is in glory.

## 2 Corinthians 3:12

Therefore, having such a hope, we speak with great boldness,

## 2 Corinthians 3:13

And we are not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face so that the sons of Israel would not fix their gaze on what was fading away.

## 2 Corinthians 3:14

But their minds were hardened; for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remains unlifted, because it is taken away in Christ.

## 2 Corinthians 3:15

Yet even now, whenever Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts;

## 2 Corinthians 3:16

But whenever someone turns to the Lord, the veil is removed.

## 2 Corinthians 3:17

Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.

## 2 Corinthians 3:18

But we all, with unveiled faces, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as from the Lord, the Spirit.
