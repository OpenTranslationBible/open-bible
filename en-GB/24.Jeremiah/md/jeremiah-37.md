# Jeremiah Chapter 37

## Jeremiah 37:1  
Now Zedekiah the son of Josiah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had made king in the land of Judah, reigned as king in place of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim.

## Jeremiah 37:2  
But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land listened to the words of the Lord which He spoke through Jeremiah the prophet.

## Jeremiah 37:3  
Yet King Zedekiah sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, to Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “Please pray to the Lord our God in our behalf.”

## Jeremiah 37:4  
Now Jeremiah was still coming and going among the people, for they had not yet put him in prison.

## Jeremiah 37:5  
Meanwhile, Pharaoh’s army had left Egypt; and when the Chaldeans who had been besieging Jerusalem heard the news about them, they withdrew from Jerusalem.

## Jeremiah 37:6  
Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet, saying,

## Jeremiah 37:7  
“This is what the Lord, the God of Israel says: ‘This is what you are to say to the king of Judah, who sent you to Me to inquire of Me:  
Behold, Pharaoh’s army, which has come out to help you, will return to its own land of Egypt.

## Jeremiah 37:8  
Then the Chaldeans will return and fight against this city, and they will capture it and burn it with fire.’

## Jeremiah 37:9  
This is what the Lord says: ‘Do not deceive yourselves, saying, “The Chaldeans will certainly go away from us,” for they will not go.

## Jeremiah 37:10  
Even if you had defeated the entire army of the Chaldeans who are fighting against you, and only wounded men were left among them,  
they would still rise up, each man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.’”

## Jeremiah 37:11  
Now it happened when the army of the Chaldeans had withdrawn from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh’s army,

## Jeremiah 37:12  
that Jeremiah left Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin to take possession of some property there among the people.

## Jeremiah 37:13  
While he was at the Gate of Benjamin, a captain of the guard whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah, was there;  
and he arrested Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “You are going over to the Chaldeans!”

## Jeremiah 37:14  
But Jeremiah said, “It is a lie! I am not going over to the Chaldeans.”  
Yet he would not listen to him; so Irijah arrested Jeremiah and brought him to the officials.

## Jeremiah 37:15  
And the officials were angry at Jeremiah and beat him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe, which they had made into a prison.

## Jeremiah 37:16  
For Jeremiah had come into the dungeon, that is, the vaulted cell; and Jeremiah stayed there many days.

## Jeremiah 37:17  
Now King Zedekiah sent and took him out; and in his palace the king secretly asked him and said, “Is there a word from the Lord?”  
And Jeremiah said, “There is!” Then he said, “You will be handed over to the king of Babylon.”

## Jeremiah 37:18  
Moreover, Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, “In what way have I sinned against you, or your servants, or this people, that you have put me in prison?

## Jeremiah 37:19  
Where then are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you or against this land’?

## Jeremiah 37:20  
But now, please listen, O my lord the king; please let my plea come before you, and do not make me return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, so that I will not die there.”

## Jeremiah 37:21  
Then King Zedekiah gave a command, and they placed Jeremiah in the courtyard of the guardhouse,  
and gave him a loaf of bread daily from the bakers’ street, until all the bread in the city was gone.  
So Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guardhouse.
