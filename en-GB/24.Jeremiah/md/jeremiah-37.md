# Jeremiah Chapter 37

## Jeremiah 37:1
Zedekiah, son of Josiah, was appointed king of Judah by Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, succeeding Jehoiachin, son of Jehoiakim.

## Jeremiah 37:2
Yet neither he, nor his officials, nor the people of the land heeded the words of the Lord spoken through Jeremiah the prophet.

## Jeremiah 37:3
However, King Zedekiah sent Jehucal, son of Shelemiah, and the priest Zephaniah, son of Maaseiah, to Jeremiah the prophet, requesting, “Please pray to the Lord our God for us.”

## Jeremiah 37:4
At this time, Jeremiah was free to move among the people, as he had not yet been imprisoned.

## Jeremiah 37:5
Pharaoh’s army had set out from Egypt, and when the Babylonians besieging Jerusalem heard the news about them, they withdrew from Jerusalem.

## Jeremiah 37:6
Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet:

## Jeremiah 37:7
“This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Tell the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of me, ‘Behold, Pharaoh’s army, which set out to assist you, will return to its own land, Egypt.

## Jeremiah 37:8
Then the Babylonians will return and fight against this city; they will capture it and set it ablaze.’

## Jeremiah 37:9
This is what the Lord says: ‘Do not deceive yourselves, thinking, “The Babylonians will certainly leave us.” They will not!

## Jeremiah 37:10
Even if you were to defeat the entire Babylonian army that is attacking you and only the wounded remained in their tents, they would rise up and set this city on fire.’”

## Jeremiah 37:11
When the Babylonian army had withdrawn from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh’s army,

## Jeremiah 37:12
Jeremiah set out from Jerusalem to go to the territory of Benjamin to claim his share of property among the people there.

## Jeremiah 37:13
But upon reaching the Benjamin Gate, the captain of the guard, Irijah, son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah, arrested him, claiming, “You are deserting to the Babylonians!”

## Jeremiah 37:14
“That is false!” Jeremiah replied. “I am not deserting to the Babylonians.” But Irijah did not listen and arrested Jeremiah, bringing him to the officials.

## Jeremiah 37:15
The officials were angry with Jeremiah, had him beaten, and imprisoned him in the house of Jonathan the scribe, which had been converted into a prison.

## Jeremiah 37:16
Jeremiah was placed in a vaulted cell in a dungeon, where he remained for many days.

## Jeremiah 37:17
Then King Zedekiah sent for him and secretly questioned him in the palace, “Is there any word from the Lord?” “Yes,” Jeremiah answered, “you will be handed over to the king of Babylon.”

## Jeremiah 37:18
Jeremiah also said to King Zedekiah, “What offence have I committed against you, your officials, or this people, that you have imprisoned me?

## Jeremiah 37:19
Where now are your prophets who prophesied to you, ‘The king of Babylon will not attack you or this land’?

## Jeremiah 37:20
But now, my lord the king, please listen to my plea: do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the scribe, or I will die there.”

## Jeremiah 37:21
Then King Zedekiah commanded that Jeremiah be placed in the courtyard of the guard and provided with a loaf of bread daily from the street of the bakers, until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard.
