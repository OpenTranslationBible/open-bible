# Jeremiah Chapter 9

## Jeremiah 9:1
Oh, that my head were a spring of water and my eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!

## Jeremiah 9:2
Oh, that I had a lodging place for travellers in the desert, so that I might leave my people and go away from them! For they are all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous people.

## Jeremiah 9:3
“They bend their tongues like bows to shoot lies; it is not by truth that they prevail in the land. They proceed from one evil to another; they do not know me,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 9:4
“Let everyone be on guard against their neighbour; do not trust any brother. For every brother utterly betrays, and every friend is a slanderer.

## Jeremiah 9:5
Friend deceives friend, and no one speaks the truth. They have taught their tongues to speak lies; they weary themselves with wrongdoing.

## Jeremiah 9:6
You dwell in the midst of deceit; in their deceit they refuse to know me,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 9:7
Therefore this is what the Lord Almighty says: “Behold, I will refine them and test them, for what else can I do because of the sin of my people?

## Jeremiah 9:8
Their tongue is a deadly arrow; it speaks deceitfully. With their mouths they speak peace to their neighbours, but in their hearts they set traps for them.

## Jeremiah 9:9
Should I not punish them for these things?” declares the Lord. “Should I not avenge myself on such a nation as this?”

## Jeremiah 9:10
I will take up a weeping and wailing for the mountains and a lament for the pastures of the wilderness, because they are desolate and untravelled, and the sound of livestock is not heard. The birds of the sky and the animals have fled; they are gone.

## Jeremiah 9:11
I will turn Jerusalem into a desolate place, a dwelling for wild animals; and I will devastate the towns of Judah so that no one can inhabit them.”

## Jeremiah 9:12
Who is wise enough to understand this? Who has been instructed by the Lord and can declare it? Why has the land been destroyed and laid waste like a desert that no one can cross?

## Jeremiah 9:13
The Lord said, “It is because they have forsaken my law, which I set before them; they have not obeyed my voice or walked according to it,

## Jeremiah 9:14
but have followed the stubbornness of their hearts and the Baals, as their ancestors taught them.”

## Jeremiah 9:15
Therefore this is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: “Behold, I will make this people eat bitter food and drink poisoned water.

## Jeremiah 9:16
I will scatter them among nations that neither they nor their ancestors have known, and I will pursue them with the sword until I have put an end to them.”

## Jeremiah 9:17
This is what the Lord Almighty says: “Consider now! Call for the mourning women to come; send for the most skillful of them.

## Jeremiah 9:18
Let them come quickly and take up a wailing for us, so that our eyes may shed tears and our eyelids flow with water.

## Jeremiah 9:19
The sound of wailing is heard from Zion: ‘How devastated we are! How great is our shame! We must leave our land because they have torn down our homes.’

## Jeremiah 9:20
Now, you women, hear the word of the Lord; open your ears to the words of his mouth. Teach your daughters how to wail; teach each other a lament.

## Jeremiah 9:21
For death has come up through our windows and has entered our fortresses; it has removed the children from the streets and the young men from the public squares.

## Jeremiah 9:22
Say, “This is what the Lord declares: ‘The corpses will lie like dung on the open field, like cut grain behind the reaper, with no one to gather them.’”

## Jeremiah 9:23
This is what the Lord says: “Let not the wise take pride in their wisdom or the strong in their strength or the rich in their wealth,

## Jeremiah 9:24
but let the one who takes pride take pride in this: that they have the understanding to know me, that I am the Lord who exercises kindness, justice, and righteousness on earth, for in these I delight,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 9:25
“Behold, the days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when I will punish all who are circumcised only in the flesh—

## Jeremiah 9:26
Egypt, Judah, Edom, Ammon, Moab, and all who live in the wilderness in distant places. For all these nations are uncircumcised, and even the whole house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart.”
