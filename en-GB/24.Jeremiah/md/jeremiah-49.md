# Jeremiah Chapter 49

## Jeremiah 49:1  
Concerning the sons of Ammon. This is what the Lord says:  
“Does Israel have no sons?  
Or has he no heir?  
Why then has Malcam taken possession of Gad,  
And his people settled in its cities?

## Jeremiah 49:2  
Therefore behold, the days are coming,” declares the Lord,  
“When I will cause a shout of battle to be heard  
Against Rabbah of the sons of Ammon;  
And it will become a desolate heap,  
And her towns will be set on fire.  
Then Israel will take possession of his possessors,”  
Says the Lord.

## Jeremiah 49:3  
“Wail, Heshbon, for Ai has been destroyed!  
Cry out, daughters of Rabbah,  
Put on sackcloth and mourn,  
And move about inside the walls;  
For Malcam will go into exile  
Together with his priests and his leaders.

## Jeremiah 49:4  
Why do you boast in the valleys,  
Your flowing valley,  
You backsliding daughter  
Who trusts in her treasures, saying,  
‘Who can come against me?’

## Jeremiah 49:5  
Behold, I am going to bring terror upon you,”  
Declares the Lord God of armies,  
“From all directions around you;  
And you will be driven away one after another,  
With no one to gather the fugitives together.

## Jeremiah 49:6  
But afterward I will restore  
The fortunes of the sons of Ammon,”  
Declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 49:7  
Concerning Edom.  
This is what the Lord of armies says:  
“Is there no longer any wisdom in Teman?  
Has good advice been lost by the prudent?  
Has their wisdom decayed?

## Jeremiah 49:8  
Flee, turn back, dwell in the depths,  
You inhabitants of Dedan,  
For I will bring the disaster of Esau upon him  
At the time I punish him.

## Jeremiah 49:9  
If grape gatherers came to you,  
Would they not leave some gleanings?  
If thieves came by night,  
They would destroy only until they had enough.

## Jeremiah 49:10  
But I have stripped Esau bare,  
I have uncovered his hiding places  
So that he will not be able to conceal himself;  
His descendants have been destroyed along with his relatives  
And his neighbors, and he no longer exists.

## Jeremiah 49:11  
Leave your orphans behind, I will keep them alive;  
And let your widows trust in Me.”

## Jeremiah 49:12  
For this is what the Lord says:  
“Behold, those who were not sentenced to drink the cup will certainly drink it,  
So are you the one who will go completely unpunished?  
You will not go unpunished, but you will certainly drink it.

## Jeremiah 49:13  
For I have sworn by Myself,” declares the Lord,  
“that Bozrah will become an object of horror,  
A disgrace, a desolation, and a curse;  
And all its cities will become perpetual ruins.”

## Jeremiah 49:14  
I have heard a message from the Lord,  
And a messenger is being sent among the nations, saying,  
“Gather yourselves together and come against her,  
And rise up for battle!”

## Jeremiah 49:15  
“For behold, I have made you small among the nations,  
Despised among people.

## Jeremiah 49:16  
As for the terror of you,  
The arrogance of your heart has deceived you,  
You who live in the clefts of the rock,  
Who occupy the height of the hill.  
Though you make your nest as high as that of an eagle,  
I will bring you down from there,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 49:17  
“Edom will become an object of horror;  
Everyone who passes by it will be appalled  
And will hiss at all its wounds.

## Jeremiah 49:18  
Like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah with its neighbors,” says the Lord,  
“No one will live there,  
Nor will anyone of mankind reside in it.

## Jeremiah 49:19  
Behold, one will come up like a lion from the thickets of the Jordan  
Against a perennially watered pasture;  
For in an instant I will make them run away from it,  
And whoever is chosen I shall appoint over it.  
For who is like Me, and who will summon Me into court?  
And who then is the shepherd who can stand against Me?”

## Jeremiah 49:20  
Therefore hear the plan of the Lord  
Which He has planned against Edom,  
And His strategies which He has devised against the inhabitants of Teman:  
Surely they will drag them off,  
The little ones of the flock;  
Surely He will make their pasture desolate because of them.

## Jeremiah 49:21  
The earth has quaked at the noise of their downfall.  
There is an outcry! The noise of it has been heard at the Red Sea.

## Jeremiah 49:22  
Behold, He will mount up and swoop like an eagle,  
And spread out His wings against Bozrah;  
And on that day the hearts of the warriors of Edom  
Will be like the heart of a woman in labour.

## Jeremiah 49:23  
Concerning Damascus:  
“Hamath and Arpad are put to shame,  
For they have heard bad news;  
They despair.  
There is anxiety at the sea,  
It cannot be calmed.

## Jeremiah 49:24  
Damascus has become helpless;  
She has turned away to flee,  
And panic has gripped her;  
Distress and labour pains have seized her  
Like a woman in childbirth.

## Jeremiah 49:25  
How the city of praise has not been deserted,  
The town of My joy!

## Jeremiah 49:26  
Therefore, her young men will fall in her streets,  
And all the men of war will perish on that day,”  
Declares the Lord of armies.

## Jeremiah 49:27  
“I will set fire to the wall of Damascus,  
And it will consume the fortified palace of Ben-hadad.”

## Jeremiah 49:28  
Concerning Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor,  
Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon defeated.  
This is what the Lord says:  
“Arise, go up to Kedar  
And destroy the people of the east.

## Jeremiah 49:29  
They will take away their tents and their flocks;  
They will carry off for themselves their tent curtains,  
All their goods and their camels,  
And they will call out to one another,  
‘Terror on every side!’

## Jeremiah 49:30  
Flee, run away quickly!  
Dwell in the depths, you inhabitants of Hazor,”  
Declares the Lord;  
“For Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has formed a plan against you  
And devised a scheme against you.

## Jeremiah 49:31  
Arise, go up against a nation which is at ease,  
Which lives securely,” declares the Lord.  
“It has no gates or bars;  
They dwell alone.

## Jeremiah 49:32  
Their camels will become plunder,  
And their many livestock for spoils,  
And I will scatter to all the winds those who cut the corners of their hair;  
And I will bring their disaster from every side,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 49:33  
“Hazor will become a haunt of jackals,  
A desolation forever;  
No one will live there,  
Nor will anyone of mankind reside in it.”

## Jeremiah 49:34  
This is the word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam,  
At the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying:

## Jeremiah 49:35  
“This is what the Lord of armies says:  
‘Behold, I am going to break the bow of Elam,  
The finest of their might.

## Jeremiah 49:36  
I will bring upon Elam the four winds  
From the four ends of heaven,  
And will scatter them to all these winds;  
And there will be no nation  
To which the scattered refugees of Elam will not go.

## Jeremiah 49:37  
So I will shatter Elam before their enemies  
And before those who seek their lives;  
And I will bring disaster upon them,  
My fierce anger,’ declares the Lord,  
‘And I will send the sword after them  
Until I have eliminated them.

## Jeremiah 49:38  
Then I will set My throne in Elam  
And eliminate from there king and officials,’  
Declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 49:39  
‘But it will come about in the last days  
That I will restore the fortunes of Elam,’”  
Declares the Lord.
