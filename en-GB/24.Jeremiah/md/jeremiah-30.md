# Jeremiah Chapter 30

## Jeremiah 30:1  
The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying,

## Jeremiah 30:2  
“This is what the Lord, the God of Israel says: ‘Write all the words which I have spoken to you in a book.

## Jeremiah 30:3  
For behold, days are coming,’ declares the Lord, ‘when I will restore the fortunes of My people Israel and Judah.’  
The Lord says, ‘I will also bring them back to the land that I gave to their forefathers, and they shall take possession of it.’”

## Jeremiah 30:4  
Now these are the words which the Lord spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah:

## Jeremiah 30:5  
“For this is what the Lord says:  
‘We have heard a sound of trembling,  
Of dread, and there is no peace.

## Jeremiah 30:6  
Ask now, and see  
If a male can give birth.  
Why do I see every man  
With his hands on his waist, as a woman in childbirth?  
And why have all faces turned pale?

## Jeremiah 30:7  
Woe, for that day is great,  
There is none like it;  
And it is the time of Jacob’s distress,  
Yet he will be saved from it.

## Jeremiah 30:8  
It shall come about on that day,’ declares the Lord of armies,  
‘That I will break his yoke from their necks and will tear off their restraints;  
And strangers will no longer make them their slaves.

## Jeremiah 30:9  
But they shall serve the Lord their God,  
And David their king, whom I will raise up for them.

## Jeremiah 30:10  
‘So do not fear, Jacob My servant,’ declares the Lord,  
‘Nor be dismayed, Israel;  
For behold, I am going to save you from far away,  
And your descendants from the land of their captivity.  
Jacob will return and be at peace, without anxiety,  
And no one will make him afraid.

## Jeremiah 30:11  
For I am with you,’ declares the Lord,  
‘to save you;  
For I will completely destroy all the nations where I have scattered you,  
Only I will not destroy you completely.  
But I will discipline you properly  
And by no means leave you unpunished.’

## Jeremiah 30:12  
“For this is what the Lord says:  
‘Your wound is incurable,  
And your injury is serious.

## Jeremiah 30:13  
There is no one to plead your cause;  
No healing for your sore,  
No recovery for you.

## Jeremiah 30:14  
All your lovers have forgotten you,  
They do not seek you;  
For I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy,  
With the punishment of a cruel one,  
Because your wrongdoing is abundant  
And your sins are numerous.

## Jeremiah 30:15  
Why do you cry out about your injury?  
Your pain is incurable.  
Because your wrongdoing is abundant  
And your sins are numerous,  
I have done these things to you.

## Jeremiah 30:16  
Therefore, all who devour you will be devoured;  
And all your adversaries, every one of them, will go into captivity;  
And those who plunder you will become plunder,  
And all who plunder you I will turn into plunder.

## Jeremiah 30:17  
For I will restore you to health  
And I will heal you of your wounds,’ declares the Lord,  
‘Because they have called you an outcast, saying:  
“It is Zion; no one cares for her.”’

## Jeremiah 30:18  
“This is what the Lord says:  
‘Behold, I will restore the fortunes of the tents of Jacob  
And have compassion on his dwellings;  
And the city will be rebuilt on its ruins,  
And the palace will stand on its rightful place.

## Jeremiah 30:19  
From them will come a song of thanksgiving  
And the voices of those who celebrate;  
And I will multiply them and they will not decrease;  
I will honor them and they will not be insignificant.

## Jeremiah 30:20  
Their children also will be as before,  
And their congregation will be established before Me;  
And I will punish all their oppressors.

## Jeremiah 30:21  
Their leader shall be one of them,  
And their ruler will come from their midst;  
And I will bring him near and he shall approach Me;  
For who would dare to risk his life to approach Me?’ declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 30:22  
‘And you shall be My people,  
And I will be your God.’”

## Jeremiah 30:23  
Behold, the storm of the Lord has gone forth in wrath,  
A sweeping storm;  
It will whirl down on the head of the wicked.

## Jeremiah 30:24  
The fierce anger of the Lord will not turn back  
Until He has carried out and fulfilled the intent of His heart.  
In the last days you will understand this.
