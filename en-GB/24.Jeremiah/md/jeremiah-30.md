Ask now, and see: Can a man give birth? Why then do I see every man with his hands on his stomach like a woman in labour, and why have all faces turned pale?

## Jeremiah 30:10

‘So do not fear, Jacob My servant,’ declares the Lord, ‘and do not be dismayed, Israel; for I will save you from afar, and your descendants from the land of their captivity. Jacob will return and be at peace, without anxiety, and no one will make him afraid.

## Jeremiah 30:11

For I am with you,’ declares the Lord, ‘to save you. Though I will completely destroy all the nations where I have scattered you, I will not destroy you completely. I will discipline you justly, yet I will not leave you unpunished.’

## Jeremiah 30:12

“For this is what the Lord says: ‘Your wound is incurable, your injury beyond healing.

## Jeremiah 30:13

There is no one to advocate for you, no remedy for your sore, no healing for you.

## Jeremiah 30:14

All your lovers have forgotten you; they do not seek you. I have wounded you as an enemy would, with the punishment of a cruel one, because your guilt is great and your sins are numerous.

## Jeremiah 30:15

Why do you cry out over your wound, your pain that has no cure? Because your wrongdoing is great and your sins are many, I have done these things to you.

## Jeremiah 30:16

Therefore, all who devour you will be devoured; all your adversaries, every one of them, will go into captivity; those who plunder you will become plunder, and all who make spoil of you I will despoil.

## Jeremiah 30:17

However, I will restore you to health and heal your wounds,’ declares the Lord, ‘because you are called an outcast, Zion for whom no one cares.’

## Jeremiah 30:18

“This is what the Lord says: ‘Behold, I will restore the fortunes of Jacob’s tents and have compassion on his dwellings; the city will be rebuilt on its ruins, and the palace will stand in its rightful place.

## Jeremiah 30:19

From them will come songs of thanksgiving and the sound of rejoicing. I will multiply them, and they will not be diminished; I will honour them, and they will not be disdained.

## Jeremiah 30:20

Their children will thrive as in days of old, and their community will be established before Me; I will punish all who oppress them.

## Jeremiah 30:21

Their leader will be one of their own, and their ruler will come from their midst. I will bring him near, and he will approach Me— for who would dare to risk his life to approach Me?’ declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 30:22

‘So you will be My people, and I will be your God.’”

## Jeremiah 30:23

Behold, the storm of the Lord! Wrath has gone forth, a sweeping tempest; it will whirl upon the heads of the wicked.

## Jeremiah 30:24

The fierce anger of the Lord will not turn back until He has performed and accomplished the purposes of His heart. In the latter days you will understand this.
