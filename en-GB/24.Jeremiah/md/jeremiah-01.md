# Jeremiah Chapter 1

## Jeremiah 1:1
The words of Jeremiah, son of Hilkiah, one of the priests at Anathoth in the land of Benjamin,

## Jeremiah 1:2
to whom the word of the Lord came during the days of Josiah, son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.

## Jeremiah 1:3
It also came during the reign of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the fifth month of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, son of Josiah, king of Judah, when the people of Jerusalem went into exile.

## Jeremiah 1:4
Now the word of the Lord came to me, saying,

## Jeremiah 1:5
“Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.”

## Jeremiah 1:6
Then I said, “Alas, Sovereign Lord! I do not know how to speak, for I am a youth.”

## Jeremiah 1:7
But the Lord said to me, “Do not say, ‘I am too young,’ for you must go to everyone I send you to and speak whatever I command you.

## Jeremiah 1:8
Do not be afraid of them, for I am with you to deliver you,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 1:9
Then the Lord reached out His hand and touched my mouth and said to me, “I have put My words in your mouth.

## Jeremiah 1:10
See, today I appoint you over nations and kingdoms to uproot and tear down, to destroy and overthrow, to build and to plant.”

## Jeremiah 1:11
The word of the Lord came to me, saying, “What do you see, Jeremiah?” And I replied, “I see the branch of an almond tree.”

## Jeremiah 1:12
The Lord said to me, “You have seen correctly, for I am watching over My word to fulfil it.”

## Jeremiah 1:13
The word of the Lord came to me a second time, saying, “What do you see?” And I said, “I see a boiling pot, tilting away from the north.”

## Jeremiah 1:14
Then the Lord said to me, “From the north disaster will be poured out on all who live in the land.

## Jeremiah 1:15
For I am about to summon all the peoples of the northern kingdoms,” declares the Lord. “Their kings will come and set up their thrones at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem; they will come against all her surrounding walls and against all the towns of Judah.

## Jeremiah 1:16
I will pronounce my judgments on them because of their wickedness in forsaking me, in burning incense to other gods and in worshipping what their hands have made.

## Jeremiah 1:17
“Prepare yourself! Stand up and say to them whatever I command you. Do not be dismayed by them, or I will dismay you before them.

## Jeremiah 1:18
Today I have made you like a fortified city, an iron pillar and a bronze wall to stand against the whole land—against the kings of Judah, its officials, its priests, and the people of the land.

## Jeremiah 1:19
They will fight against you but will not overcome you, for I am with you to rescue you,” declares the Lord.
