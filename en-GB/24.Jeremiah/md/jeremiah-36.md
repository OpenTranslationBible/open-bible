# Jeremiah Chapter 36

## Jeremiah 36:1
In the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, this message came to Jeremiah from the Lord:

## Jeremiah 36:2
“Take a scroll and inscribe on it all the words I have spoken to you concerning Israel, Judah, and all the nations, from the time I first spoke to you during the reign of Josiah up to this day.

## Jeremiah 36:3
Perhaps the people of Judah will hear of all the calamity I intend to bring upon them, and each one will turn from his evil path; then I will forgive their iniquity and their sin.”

## Jeremiah 36:4
Jeremiah then summoned Baruch son of Neriah, and as Jeremiah dictated all the words the Lord had spoken to him, Baruch wrote them on the scroll.

## Jeremiah 36:5
Jeremiah instructed Baruch, saying, “I am restricted; I cannot enter the house of the Lord.

## Jeremiah 36:6
Therefore, you go and read from the scroll, which you have inscribed at my dictation, the words of the Lord to the people in the Lord’s house on a day of fasting. Also, read them to all the people of Judah who come from their towns.

## Jeremiah 36:7
Perhaps their plea will come before the Lord, and every one of them will turn from his evil way, for great is the anger and wrath that the Lord has pronounced against this people.”

## Jeremiah 36:8
Baruch son of Neriah did everything Jeremiah the prophet commanded him; he read from the scroll the words of the Lord in the house of the Lord.

## Jeremiah 36:9
In the ninth month of the fifth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, a fast before the Lord was proclaimed for all the people in Jerusalem and those who came from the towns of Judah.

## Jeremiah 36:10
Then Baruch read from the scroll the words of Jeremiah to all the people in the house of the Lord, in the chamber of Gemariah son of Shaphan the scribe, in the upper courtyard, at the entrance of the New Gate of the Lord’s house.

## Jeremiah 36:11
When Micaiah son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, heard all the words from the scroll,

## Jeremiah 36:12
he went down to the scribe’s chamber in the royal palace, where all the officials were sitting: Elishama the scribe, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Akbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the other officials.

## Jeremiah 36:13
Micaiah reported to them all the words he had heard when Baruch read from the scroll to the people.

## Jeremiah 36:14
Then all the officials sent Jehudi son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, “Bring the scroll from which you have read to the people and come.” So Baruch son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and went to them.

## Jeremiah 36:15
They said to him, “Please sit down and read it to us.” So Baruch read it to them.

## Jeremiah 36:16
When they heard all these words, they looked at each other in fear and said to Baruch, “We must inform the king of all these words.”

## Jeremiah 36:17
They then asked Baruch, “Tell us, how did you come to write all this? Was it at Jeremiah’s dictation?”

## Jeremiah 36:18
“Yes,” Baruch replied, “he dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them with ink on the scroll.”

## Jeremiah 36:19
Then the officials advised Baruch, “You and Jeremiah should find a safe place. Do not let anyone know where you are.”

## Jeremiah 36:20
They placed the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe and went to the king in the courtyard, reporting everything to him.

## Jeremiah 36:21
The king sent Jehudi to fetch the scroll, and Jehudi brought it from the chamber of Elishama the scribe and read it to the king and all the officials standing beside him.

## Jeremiah 36:22
It was the ninth month, and the king was sitting in the winter house, with a fire burning in the brazier before him.

## Jeremiah 36:23
As Jehudi read three or four columns, the king cut them off with a scribe’s knife and threw them into the brazier, until the entire scroll was consumed in the fire.

## Jeremiah 36:24
The king and all his servants who heard all these words did not show fear, nor did they tear their garments.

## Jeremiah 36:25
Although Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah implored the king not to burn the scroll, he refused to heed their words.

## Jeremiah 36:26
Instead, the king commanded Jerahmeel, a son of the king, Seraiah son of Azriel, and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to seize Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet, but the Lord hid them.

## Jeremiah 36:27
After the king burned the scroll with the words that Baruch had written at Jeremiah’s dictation, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah:

## Jeremiah 36:28
“Take another scroll and write on it all the words that were on the first scroll, which Jehoiakim king of Judah burned.

## Jeremiah 36:29
Concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah, you shall say, ‘This is what the Lord says: You burned that scroll and said, “Why did you write on it that the king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land and make it desolate of both man and beast?”

## Jeremiah 36:30
Therefore, this is what the Lord says about Jehoiakim king of Judah: He will have no one to sit on the throne of David; his corpse will be exposed to the heat by day and the frost by night.

## Jeremiah 36:31
I will punish him, his descendants, and his servants for their iniquity. I will bring upon them and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the people of Judah all the disaster I have pronounced against them, because they have not listened.’”

## Jeremiah 36:32
Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to the scribe Baruch son of Neriah, and as Jeremiah dictated, Baruch wrote on it all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire, and many similar words were added to them.
