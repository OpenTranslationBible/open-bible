# Jeremiah Chapter 28

## Jeremiah 28:1
In the same year, at the start of Zedekiah king of Judah's reign, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, Hananiah the prophet, son of Azzur, from Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of the Lord in the presence of the priests and all the people, saying:

## Jeremiah 28:2
“This is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, declares: ‘I have shattered the yoke of the king of Babylon.

## Jeremiah 28:3
Within two years I will restore to this place all the articles of the Lord's house that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took from here and brought to Babylon.

## Jeremiah 28:4
I will also bring back to this place Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and all the exiles of Judah who went to Babylon,’ declares the Lord, ‘for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.’”

## Jeremiah 28:5
Jeremiah the prophet addressed Hananiah the prophet in the presence of the priests and all the people who were gathered in the house of the Lord,

## Jeremiah 28:6
and said, “Amen! May the Lord do so! May the Lord fulfil the words you have prophesied by bringing back the articles of the Lord’s house and all the exiles from Babylon to this place.

## Jeremiah 28:7
However, hear now this word that I am about to speak in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people:

## Jeremiah 28:8
The prophets who came before you and me from ancient times prophesied against many lands and great kingdoms, concerning war, disaster, and plague.

## Jeremiah 28:9
But the prophet who prophesies peace will be recognised as truly sent by the Lord only if his prediction comes to pass.”

## Jeremiah 28:10
Then Hananiah the prophet removed the yoke from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet and broke it.

## Jeremiah 28:11
And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, “This is what the Lord says: ‘In the same way, within two years I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all the nations.’” At this, Jeremiah the prophet went on his way.

## Jeremiah 28:12
After Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah:

## Jeremiah 28:13
“Go and tell Hananiah, ‘This is what the Lord says: You have broken a wooden yoke, but in its place you will have a yoke of iron.

## Jeremiah 28:14
For this is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: I will put an iron yoke on the necks of all these nations to make them serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and they will serve him. I will even give him control over the wild animals.’”

## Jeremiah 28:15
Then Jeremiah the prophet said to Hananiah the prophet, “Listen, Hananiah! The Lord has not sent you, and you have made this people trust in falsehood.

## Jeremiah 28:16
Therefore, this is what the Lord says: ‘Behold, I am about to remove you from the face of the earth. This year you will die, because you have preached rebellion against the Lord.’”

## Jeremiah 28:17
So Hananiah the prophet died in the seventh month of that same year.
