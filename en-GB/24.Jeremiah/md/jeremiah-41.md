# Jeremiah Chapter 41

## Jeremiah 41:1
In the seventh month, Ishmael son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, who was of royal lineage and one of the king’s officers, came to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah with ten men. While they were eating bread together there,

## Jeremiah 41:2
Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the ten men with him rose up and struck down Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the sword, killing the one whom the king of Babylon had appointed as governor over the land.

## Jeremiah 41:3
Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, as well as the Chaldean soldiers who were there.

## Jeremiah 41:4
The day after Gedaliah’s assassination, before anyone knew of it,

## Jeremiah 41:5
eighty men came from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria with their beards shaved, clothes torn, and bodies gashed, bringing grain offerings and incense to the house of the Lord.

## Jeremiah 41:6
Ishmael son of Nethaniah departed from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he approached. Upon meeting them, he said, “Come to Gedaliah son of Ahikam.”

## Jeremiah 41:7
As soon as they entered the city, Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the men with him slaughtered them and threw them into a cistern.

## Jeremiah 41:8
But ten of them said to Ishmael, “Do not kill us! We have wheat, barley, oil, and honey hidden in the field.” So he refrained and did not kill them with the others.

## Jeremiah 41:9
Now the cistern where Ishmael had thrown all the bodies of the men he had killed because of Gedaliah was the one King Asa had constructed as a defence against Baasha king of Israel. Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it with the dead.

## Jeremiah 41:10
Ishmael took captive all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah—the king’s daughters and all the others left there, whom Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, had placed under the care of Gedaliah son of Ahikam. Ishmael son of Nethaniah took them captive and set out to go to the Ammonites.

## Jeremiah 41:11
When Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces with him heard about all the evil Ishmael son of Nethaniah had done,

## Jeremiah 41:12
they took all their men and went to fight Ishmael son of Nethaniah. They found him near the great pool in Gibeon.

## Jeremiah 41:13
When all the people with Ishmael saw Johanan son of Kareah and the commanders of the forces with him, they were overjoyed.

## Jeremiah 41:14
All the people whom Ishmael had taken captive from Mizpah turned and went over to Johanan son of Kareah.

## Jeremiah 41:15
However, Ishmael son of Nethaniah managed to escape from Johanan with eight men and fled to the Ammonites.

## Jeremiah 41:16
Then Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces with him took from Mizpah all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael son of Nethaniah, after he had killed Gedaliah son of Ahikam—the soldiers, women, children, and court officials whom he had brought back from Gibeon.

## Jeremiah 41:17
And they went and stayed at Geruth Kimham near Bethlehem, intending to go to Egypt

## Jeremiah 41:18
to escape the Chaldeans. They were afraid of them because Ishmael son of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had appointed as governor over the land.
