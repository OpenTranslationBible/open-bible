# Jeremiah Chapter 50

## Jeremiah 50:1
The message which the Lord communicated through Jeremiah the prophet concerning Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans:

## Jeremiah 50:2
“Declare it among the nations and make it known; raise a banner and do not conceal it. Say, ‘Babylon has been seized; Bel is put to shame, Marduk is dismayed. Her idols are disgraced, her images are shattered.’

## Jeremiah 50:3
For a nation from the north will come against her, making her land desolate, so that no one will dwell in it. Both people and animals have fled.

## Jeremiah 50:4
“In those days and at that time,” says the Lord, “the people of Israel and the people of Judah will come together, weeping as they go, to seek the Lord their God.

## Jeremiah 50:5
They will ask for the way to Zion, turning their faces towards it; they will come and bind themselves to the Lord in an everlasting covenant that will not be forgotten.

## Jeremiah 50:6
“My people have become lost sheep; their shepherds have misled them, causing them to wander on the mountains. They have roamed from mountain to hill and forgotten their resting place.

## Jeremiah 50:7
All who found them devoured them; and their adversaries said, ‘We are not guilty, for they have sinned against the Lord, their true pasture, the hope of their ancestors.’

## Jeremiah 50:8
“Flee from the midst of Babylon and leave the land of the Chaldeans; be like the goats that lead the flock.

## Jeremiah 50:9
For I am stirring up and bringing against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north. They will set themselves in array against her, and from there she will be captured. Their arrows will be like those of a skilled warrior who does not return empty-handed.

## Jeremiah 50:10
Chaldea will be plundered; all who plunder her will have their fill,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 50:11
“Because you rejoice and are jubilant, you who plunder my inheritance, because you frolic like a threshing heifer and neigh like stallions,

## Jeremiah 50:12
your mother will be greatly ashamed; she who bore you will be humiliated. She will become the least of the nations, a wilderness, a parched land, a desert.

## Jeremiah 50:13
Because of the Lord’s wrath she will not be inhabited but will be utterly desolate. Everyone who passes by Babylon will be appalled and will scoff at all her wounds.

## Jeremiah 50:14
“Encircle Babylon, all you who draw the bow. Shoot at her, do not hold back your arrows, for she has sinned against the Lord.

## Jeremiah 50:15
Raise a shout against her on every side! She has surrendered, her towers have fallen, her walls have been torn down. This is the Lord’s vengeance; take vengeance on her; do to her as she has done to others.

## Jeremiah 50:16
Cut off the sower from Babylon, and the one who wields the sickle at harvest time. Because of the oppressor’s sword, everyone will return to their own people, each fleeing to their own land.

## Jeremiah 50:17
“Israel is a scattered flock, driven away by lions. The first to devour them was the king of Assyria; the last to gnaw their bones was Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.”

## Jeremiah 50:18
Therefore, this is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: “I will punish the king of Babylon and his land as I punished the king of Assyria.

## Jeremiah 50:19
And I will bring Israel back to their pasture, and they will graze on Carmel and Bashan; their appetite will be satisfied on the hills of Ephraim and Gilead.

## Jeremiah 50:20
In those days and at that time,” declares the Lord, “search will be made for Israel’s guilt, but there will be none, and for the sins of Judah, but none will be found, for I will forgive the remnant I spare.

## Jeremiah 50:21
“Advance against the land of Merathaim and those who live in Pekod. Pursue, strike, and completely destroy them,” declares the Lord. “Carry out everything I have commanded you.

## Jeremiah 50:22
The sound of battle is in the land, the sound of great destruction!

## Jeremiah 50:23
How the mighty hammer of the whole earth has been cut off and broken! How Babylon has become a horror among the nations!

## Jeremiah 50:24
I laid a snare for you, Babylon, and you were caught before you knew it; you were found and captured because you opposed the Lord.

## Jeremiah 50:25
The Lord has opened His armoury and brought out the weapons of His wrath, for the Sovereign Lord of Hosts has work to do in the land of the Chaldeans.

## Jeremiah 50:26
Come against her from the farthest border. Open her storehouses; pile her up like heaps of grain and completely destroy her, leaving no remnant.

## Jeremiah 50:27
Put all her young bulls to the sword; let them go down to the slaughter! Woe to them, for their day has come, the time for them to be punished.

## Jeremiah 50:28
Hear the fugitives and refugees from Babylon proclaiming in Zion how the Lord our God has taken vengeance, vengeance for His temple.

## Jeremiah 50:29
“Summon archers against Babylon, all those who draw the bow. Encamp all around her; let no one escape. Repay her according to her deeds; do to her as she has done. For she has defied the Lord, the Holy One of Israel.

## Jeremiah 50:30
Therefore, her young men will fall in her streets; all her soldiers will be silenced in that day,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 50:31
“Behold, I am against you, you arrogant one,” declares the Lord, the Lord of Hosts, “for your day has come, the time when I will punish you.

## Jeremiah 50:32
The arrogant one will stumble and fall with no one to raise her up; I will kindle a fire in her towns that will consume all her surroundings.”

## Jeremiah 50:33
This is what the Lord of Hosts says: “The people of Israel are oppressed, and the people of Judah as well. All their captors hold them fast, refusing to let them go.

## Jeremiah 50:34
Yet their Redeemer is strong; the Lord of Hosts is His name. He will vigorously defend their cause so that He may bring rest to their land, but unrest to those who live in Babylon.

## Jeremiah 50:35
“A sword against the Chaldeans!” declares the Lord—“against those who live in Babylon and against her officials and wise men!

## Jeremiah 50:36
A sword against her oracle priests! They will become fools. A sword against her warriors! They will be filled with terror.

## Jeremiah 50:37
A sword against her horses and chariots and all the foreigners in her ranks! They will become weaklings. A sword against her treasures! They will be plundered.

## Jeremiah 50:38
A drought on her waters! They will dry up. For it is a land of idols, and they go mad with terror.

## Jeremiah 50:39
“So desert creatures and jackals will live there, and there the ostriches will dwell. It will never again be inhabited or lived in from generation to generation.

## Jeremiah 50:40
As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah with their neighbouring towns,” declares the Lord, “so no one will live there; no people will dwell in it.

## Jeremiah 50:41
“Behold! A people is coming from the north; a great nation and many kings are being stirred up from the ends of the earth.

## Jeremiah 50:42
They are armed with bows and javelins; they are cruel and without mercy. Their voice roars like the sea as they ride on horses; they come like men in battle formation against you, Daughter Babylon.

## Jeremiah 50:43
The king of Babylon has heard the report about them, and his hands hang limp. Anguish has gripped him, pain like that of a woman in labour.

## Jeremiah 50:44
“Behold, one will come up like a lion from the thickets of the Jordan to a rich pastureland; for in an instant I will chase them away from it, and I will appoint over it whoever is chosen. For who is like Me, and who can challenge Me? And what shepherd can stand against Me?”

## Jeremiah 50:45
Therefore, hear what the Lord has planned against Babylon, what He has purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: The young of the flock will be dragged away; their pasture will be appalled at their fate.

## Jeremiah 50:46
At the sound of Babylon’s capture, the earth will tremble; its outcry will be heard among the nations.
