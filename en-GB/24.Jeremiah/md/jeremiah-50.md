# Jeremiah Chapter 50

## Jeremiah 50:1  
The word which the Lord spoke concerning Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans, through Jeremiah the prophet:

## Jeremiah 50:2  
“Declare and proclaim among the nations. Proclaim it and lift up a flag,  
Do not conceal it. Say,  
‘Babylon has been captured,  
Bel has been put to shame, Marduk has been shattered;  
Her images have been put to shame, her idols have been shattered.’

## Jeremiah 50:3  
For a nation has come up against her out of the north;  
It will make her land an object of horror,  
And there will be no inhabitant in it.  
Both people and animals have wandered off, they have gone away!”

## Jeremiah 50:4  
“In those days and at that time,” declares the Lord,  
“the sons of Israel will come,  
They and the sons of Judah as well;  
They will go along weeping as they go,  
And it will be the Lord their God they will seek.

## Jeremiah 50:5  
They will ask for the way to Zion,  
Turning their faces in its direction;  
They will come so that they may join themselves to the Lord  
In an everlasting covenant that will not be forgotten.”

## Jeremiah 50:6  
“My people have become lost sheep;  
Their shepherds have led them astray.  
They have made them turn aside on the mountains;  
They have gone from mountain to hill,  
They have forgotten their resting place.

## Jeremiah 50:7  
All who found them have devoured them;  
And their adversaries have said, ‘We are not guilty,  
Since they have sinned against the Lord who is the resting place of righteousness,  
The Lord, the hope of their fathers.’

## Jeremiah 50:8  
Wander away from the midst of Babylon,  
And go out from the land of the Chaldeans;  
Be like male goats at the head of the flock.

## Jeremiah 50:9  
For behold, I am going to stir up and bring against Babylon  
A contingent of great nations from the land of the north,  
And they will line up their battle lines against her;  
From there she will be taken captive.  
Their arrows will be like an expert warrior  
Who does not return empty-handed.

## Jeremiah 50:10  
Chaldea will become plunder;  
All who plunder her will have enough,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 50:11  
“Because you are glad, because you are joyful,  
You who pillage My heritage,  
Because you skip about like a threshing heifer  
And neigh like strong horses,

## Jeremiah 50:12  
Your mother will be greatly ashamed,  
She who gave birth to you will be humiliated.  
Behold, she will be the least of the nations,  
A wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.

## Jeremiah 50:13  
Because of the wrath of the Lord she will not be inhabited,  
But she will be completely desolate;  
Everyone who passes by Babylon will be appalled  
And will hiss because of all her wounds.

## Jeremiah 50:14  
Line up in battle against Babylon on every side,  
All you who bend the bow;  
Shoot at her, do not spare your arrows,  
For she has sinned against the Lord.

## Jeremiah 50:15  
Raise your battle cry against her on every side!  
She has given herself up, her towers have fallen,  
Her walls have been pulled down,  
For this is the vengeance of the Lord:  
Take vengeance on her;  
As she has done to others, so do to her.

## Jeremiah 50:16  
Eliminate the sower from Babylon  
And the one who wields the sickle at the time of harvest;  
From the oppression of the sword, each of them will turn back to his people  
And each of them will flee to his own land.

## Jeremiah 50:17  
Israel is a scattered flock, the lions have driven it away.  
The first one who devoured him was the king of Assyria,  
And this last one who has broken his bones  
Is Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.

## Jeremiah 50:18  
Therefore this is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel says:  
“Behold, I am going to punish the king of Babylon and his land,  
Just as I punished the king of Assyria.

## Jeremiah 50:19  
And I will bring Israel back to his pasture,  
And he will graze on Carmel and Bashan,  
And his soul will be satisfied in the hill country of Ephraim and Gilead.

## Jeremiah 50:20  
In those days and at that time,” declares the Lord,  
“Search will be made for the guilt of Israel, but there will be none,  
And for the sins of Judah, but they will not be found;  
For I will forgive those whom I leave as a remnant.”

## Jeremiah 50:21  
“Against the land of Merathaim, go up against it,  
And against the inhabitants of Pekod.  
Put them to the sword and completely destroy them,” declares the Lord,  
“And do everything that I have commanded you.

## Jeremiah 50:22  
The noise of battle is in the land,  
And great destruction.

## Jeremiah 50:23  
How the hammer of the whole earth  
Has been cut off and broken!  
How Babylon has become an object of horror among the nations!

## Jeremiah 50:24  
I set a trap for you and you were also caught, Babylon,  
While you yourself were not aware;  
You have been found and also seized,  
Because you have engaged in conflict with the Lord.”

## Jeremiah 50:25  
The Lord has opened His armory  
And has brought out the weapons of His indignation,  
For it is a work of the Lord God of armies  
In the land of the Chaldeans.

## Jeremiah 50:26  
Come to her from the farthest border;  
Open her barns,  
Pile her up like heaps of grain  
And completely destroy her,  
Let nothing be left to her.

## Jeremiah 50:27  
Put all her young bulls to the sword;  
Let them go down to the slaughter!  
Woe to them, for their day has come,  
The time of their punishment.

## Jeremiah 50:28  
There is a sound of fugitives and refugees from the land of Babylon,  
To declare in Zion the vengeance of the Lord our God,  
Vengeance for His temple.

## Jeremiah 50:29  
Summon many against Babylon,  
All those who bend the bow:  
Encamp against her on every side,  
Let there be no escape.  
Repay her according to her work;  
According to all that she has done, so do to her;  
For she has become arrogant against the Lord,  
Against the Holy One of Israel.

## Jeremiah 50:30  
Therefore her young men will fall in her streets,  
And all her men of war will perish on that day,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 50:31  
“Behold, I am against you, you arrogant one,”  
Declares the Lord God of armies,  
“For your day has come,  
The time when I will punish you.

## Jeremiah 50:32  
The arrogant one will stumble and fall  
With no one to raise him up;  
And I will set fire to his cities,  
And it will devour all his surroundings.”

## Jeremiah 50:33  
This is what the Lord of armies says:  
“The sons of Israel are oppressed,  
And the sons of Judah as well;  
And all who took them captive have held them firmly,  
They have refused to let them go.

## Jeremiah 50:34  
Their Redeemer is strong, the Lord of armies is His name;  
He will vigorously plead their case  
So that He may bring rest to their land,  
But unrest to the inhabitants of Babylon.

## Jeremiah 50:35  
A sword against the Chaldeans,” declares the Lord,  
“And against the inhabitants of Babylon,  
And against her officials and her wise men!

## Jeremiah 50:36  
A sword against the oracle priests, and they will become fools!  
A sword against her warriors, and they will be shattered!

## Jeremiah 50:37  
A sword against her horses, her chariots,  
And against all the foreigners who are in the midst of her,  
And they will become women!  
A sword against her treasures, and they will be plundered!

## Jeremiah 50:38  
A drought on her waters, and they will be dried up!  
For it is a land of idols,  
And they go insane because of their terrifying images.

## Jeremiah 50:39  
Therefore the desert creatures will live there with the jackals,  
The ostriches also will live in it,  
And it will never again be inhabited  
Or lived in from generation to generation.

## Jeremiah 50:40  
Just as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah with their neighbors,” declares the Lord,  
“No one will live there,  
Nor will anyone of mankind reside in it.

## Jeremiah 50:41  
Behold, a people is coming from the north,  
And a great nation and many kings  
Will be stirred up from the remote parts of the earth.

## Jeremiah 50:42  
They seize their bow and javelin;  
They are cruel and have no mercy.  
Their voice roars like the sea;  
And they ride on horses,  
Drawn up like a man for the battle  
Against you, daughter of Babylon.

## Jeremiah 50:43  
The king of Babylon has heard the report about them,  
And his hands hang limp;  
Distress has gripped him,  
Agony like a woman in childbirth.

## Jeremiah 50:44  
“Behold, one will come up like a lion from the thickets of the Jordan  
To a perennially watered pasture;  
For in an instant I will make them run away from it,  
And whoever is chosen I will appoint over it.  
For who is like Me, and who will summon Me into court?  
And who then is the shepherd who can stand against Me?”

## Jeremiah 50:45  
Therefore hear the plan of the Lord  
Which He has planned against Babylon,  
And His strategies which He has devised  
Against the land of the Chaldeans:  
Surely they will drag them off,  
The little ones of the flock;  
Surely He will make their pasture desolate because of them.

## Jeremiah 50:46  
At the shout, “Babylon has been seized!”  
The earth quakes,  
And an outcry is heard among the nations.
