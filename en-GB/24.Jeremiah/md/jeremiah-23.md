# Jeremiah Chapter 23

## Jeremiah 23:1
“Woe to the shepherds who are causing the sheep of my pasture to perish and scatter!” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 23:2
Therefore, this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says regarding the shepherds who tend my people: “You have scattered my flock and driven them away, and have not cared for them; behold, I will hold you accountable for the evil of your deeds,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 23:3
“Then I myself will gather the remnant of my flock from all the countries where I have driven them, and bring them back to their pasture, where they will be fruitful and multiply.

## Jeremiah 23:4
I will appoint shepherds over them who will tend them; and they will no longer be afraid or terrified, nor will any be missing,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 23:5
“Behold, the days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch; a King who will reign wisely and execute justice and righteousness in the land.

## Jeremiah 23:6
In his days Judah will be saved, and Israel will live securely; and this is the name by which he will be called: ‘The Lord Our Righteousness.’

## Jeremiah 23:7
“Therefore, behold, the days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when they will no longer say, ‘As the Lord lives, who brought the Israelites up from the land of Egypt,’

## Jeremiah 23:8
but rather, ‘As the Lord lives, who brought up and led the descendants of Israel from the north land and from all the countries where he had banished them.’ Then they will live in their own land.”

## Jeremiah 23:9
Concerning the prophets: My heart is broken within me, all my bones tremble. I am like a drunken man, like one overcome by wine, because of the Lord and his holy words.

## Jeremiah 23:10
The land is full of adulterers; because of the curse, the land mourns and the pastures of the wilderness have dried up. Their course is evil and their strength is not right.

## Jeremiah 23:11
“For both prophet and priest are defiled; even in my house I have found their wickedness,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 23:12
“Therefore their path will become slippery; they will be driven into the gloom and fall. I will bring disaster upon them in the year of their punishment,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 23:13
“Moreover, among the prophets of Samaria I saw an offensive thing: They prophesied by Baal and led my people Israel astray.

## Jeremiah 23:14
Also among the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a horrible thing: They commit adultery and walk in deceit. They strengthen the hands of evildoers, so that no one turns back from his wickedness. They are all like Sodom to me; the people of Jerusalem are like Gomorrah.”

## Jeremiah 23:15
Therefore, this is what the Lord of hosts says concerning the prophets: “Behold, I will make them eat wormwood and drink poisoned water, for ungodliness has spread from the prophets of Jerusalem throughout the land.”

## Jeremiah 23:16
This is what the Lord of hosts says: “Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you; they fill you with false hopes. They speak visions from their own minds, not from the mouth of the Lord.

## Jeremiah 23:17
They keep saying to those who despise me, ‘The Lord has said, “You will have peace.”’ And to everyone who follows the stubbornness of his heart, they say, ‘No harm will come to you.’

## Jeremiah 23:18
But who has stood in the council of the Lord to see and hear his word? Who has listened and heard his word?

## Jeremiah 23:19
Behold, the storm of the Lord has gone forth in wrath, a whirlwind swirling down on the heads of the wicked.

## Jeremiah 23:20
The anger of the Lord will not turn back until he has performed and carried out the purposes of his heart. In the last days you will understand it clearly.

## Jeremiah 23:21
I did not send these prophets, yet they ran with their message; I did not speak to them, yet they prophesied.

## Jeremiah 23:22
But if they had stood in my council, they would have proclaimed my words to my people and turned them back from their evil way and from their evil deeds.

## Jeremiah 23:23
“Am I a God who is near,” declares the Lord, “and not a God far off?

## Jeremiah 23:24
Can anyone hide in secret places so that I cannot see them?” declares the Lord. “Do I not fill heaven and earth?” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 23:25
“I have heard what the prophets say who prophesy lies in my name, saying, ‘I had a dream! I had a dream!’

## Jeremiah 23:26
How long will this continue in the hearts of these lying prophets, who prophesy the delusions of their own minds?

## Jeremiah 23:27
They think the dreams they tell one another will make my people forget my name, just as their ancestors forgot my name through Baal worship.

## Jeremiah 23:28
Let the prophet who has a dream recount the dream, but let the one who has my word speak it faithfully. For what does straw have in common with grain?” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 23:29
“Is not my word like fire,” declares the Lord, “and like a hammer that breaks a rock in pieces?

## Jeremiah 23:30
“Therefore,” declares the Lord, “I am against the prophets who steal words from one another supposedly from me.

## Jeremiah 23:31
Yes,” declares the Lord, “I am against the prophets who wag their own tongues and declare, ‘The Lord declares.’

## Jeremiah 23:32
Behold, I am against those who prophesy false dreams,” declares the Lord. “They tell them and lead my people astray with their reckless lies, yet I did not send them or appoint them. They do not benefit these people in the least,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 23:33
“When this people, or a prophet or a priest, asks you, ‘What is the message from the Lord?’ say to them, ‘What message? I will forsake you,’ declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 23:34
If a prophet or a priest or anyone else claims, ‘This is a message from the Lord,’ I will punish that person and their household.

## Jeremiah 23:35
This is what each of you will say to your neighbour and to your brother: ‘What has the Lord answered?’ or ‘What has the Lord spoken?’

## Jeremiah 23:36
But you must no longer mention ‘a message from the Lord,’ because each one’s word becomes their own message. You have perverted the words of the living God, the Lord of hosts, our God.

## Jeremiah 23:37
This is what you will say to a prophet: ‘What has the Lord answered you?’ or ‘What has the Lord spoken?’

## Jeremiah 23:38
And if you say, ‘The message of the Lord!’ for that reason the Lord says: ‘Because you have used this phrase, “The message of the Lord!” I told you not to say, “The message of the Lord!”’

## Jeremiah 23:39
Therefore, behold, I will surely forget you and cast you out of my presence, along with the city I gave to you and your ancestors.

## Jeremiah 23:40
I will bring upon you everlasting disgrace—an everlasting shame that will not be forgotten.”
