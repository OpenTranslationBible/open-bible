# Jeremiah Chapter 5

## Jeremiah 5:1
“Wander through the streets of Jerusalem, observe and take note. Search in her public squares; if you find a single person who acts justly and seeks truth, I will pardon her.

## Jeremiah 5:2
Even though they say, ‘As surely as the Lord lives,’ they are surely swearing falsely.”

## Jeremiah 5:3
Lord, do Your eyes not seek truth? You struck them, yet they felt no pain; You consumed them, yet they refused correction. They have made their faces harder than rock and have refused to turn back.

## Jeremiah 5:4
I thought, “These are only the poor; they are foolish, for they do not know the way of the Lord, the judgment of their God.

## Jeremiah 5:5
I will go to the great and speak to them, for they surely know the way of the Lord, the judgment of their God.” But they too have broken the yoke and burst the bonds.

## Jeremiah 5:6
Therefore a lion from the forest will slay them, a wolf from the desert will ravage them, a leopard is watching their cities. All who venture out will be torn to pieces, for their transgressions are many, their apostasies numerous.

## Jeremiah 5:7
“Why should I forgive you? Your children have abandoned Me and sworn by those who are not gods. I provided for them, yet they committed adultery and thronged to the houses of harlots.

## Jeremiah 5:8
They are like well-fed, lusty stallions, each neighing after his neighbour’s wife.

## Jeremiah 5:9
Shall I not punish them for these things?” declares the Lord. “Shall I not avenge Myself on a nation such as this?

## Jeremiah 5:10
“Go through her vineyards and devastate them, but do not make a complete destruction; strip away her branches, for they do not belong to the Lord.

## Jeremiah 5:11
The house of Israel and the house of Judah have been utterly unfaithful to Me,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 5:12
They have denied the Lord and said, “He will do nothing; no disaster will come upon us, nor will we see sword or famine.

## Jeremiah 5:13
The prophets are but wind, and the word is not in them; thus it will be done to them.”

## Jeremiah 5:14
Therefore, this is what the Lord God of Hosts says: “Because you have spoken this word, I will make My words in your mouth a fire and this people wood, and it will consume them.

## Jeremiah 5:15
Behold, I am bringing a nation against you from afar, O house of Israel,” declares the Lord. “It is an ancient and enduring nation, a people whose language you do not know, nor can you understand what they say.

## Jeremiah 5:16
Their quivers are like an open grave; all of them are mighty warriors.

## Jeremiah 5:17
They will consume your harvest and your food; they will devour your sons and daughters; they will consume your flocks and herds; they will devour your vines and fig trees. They will demolish your fortified cities, in which you trust, with the sword.

## Jeremiah 5:18
“Yet even in those days,” declares the Lord, “I will not make a complete destruction of you.

## Jeremiah 5:19
And when the people ask, ‘Why has the Lord our God done all this to us?’ you shall say to them, ‘As you have forsaken Me and served foreign gods in your own land, so you will serve foreigners in a land not your own.’

## Jeremiah 5:20
“Proclaim this to the descendants of Jacob and announce it in Judah:

## Jeremiah 5:21
Hear this, you senseless and foolish people, who have eyes but do not see, who have ears but do not hear:

## Jeremiah 5:22
Do you not fear Me?” declares the Lord. “Do you not tremble in My presence? I have set the sand as a boundary for the sea, an everlasting barrier it cannot cross. Though the waves toss, they cannot prevail; though they roar, they cannot cross it.

## Jeremiah 5:23
But this people has a stubborn and rebellious heart; they have turned aside and departed.

## Jeremiah 5:24
They do not say in their hearts, ‘Let us fear the Lord our God, who gives the autumn and spring rains in season, who assures us of the regular weeks of harvest.’

## Jeremiah 5:25
Your iniquities have turned these away, and your sins have deprived you of good.

## Jeremiah 5:26
For wicked men are found among My people; they lie in wait like those who set traps to catch people.

## Jeremiah 5:27
Like cages full of birds, their houses are full of deceit; therefore they have become great and rich.

## Jeremiah 5:28
They have grown fat and sleek. Their evil deeds have no limit; they do not seek justice. They do not defend the cause of the fatherless, nor do they uphold the rights of the poor.

## Jeremiah 5:29
Shall I not punish them for these things?” declares the Lord. “Shall I not avenge Myself on a nation such as this?

## Jeremiah 5:30
“An appalling and horrible thing has happened in the land:

## Jeremiah 5:31
