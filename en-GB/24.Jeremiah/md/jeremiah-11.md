# Jeremiah Chapter 11

## Jeremiah 11:1  
The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying,

## Jeremiah 11:2  
“Listen to the words of this covenant, and speak to the people of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;

## Jeremiah 11:3  
and say to them, ‘This is what the Lord, the God of Israel says:  
“Cursed is the person who does not listen to the words of this covenant,

## Jeremiah 11:4  
which I commanded your forefathers on the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying,  
‘Listen to My voice, and do according to all that I command you; so you shall be My people, and I will be your God,’

## Jeremiah 11:5  
in order to confirm the oath which I swore to your forefathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day.”’”  
Then I responded and said, “Amen, Lord.”

## Jeremiah 11:6  
And the Lord said to me, “Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying,  
‘Listen to the words of this covenant and do them.

## Jeremiah 11:7  
For I solemnly warned your forefathers on the day I brought them up from the land of Egypt, even to this day,  
Warning them again and again, saying, “Listen to My voice.”

## Jeremiah 11:8  
Yet they did not listen or incline their ear, but walked, each one, in the stubbornness of his evil heart.  
Therefore I brought on them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did not do it.’”

## Jeremiah 11:9  
Then the Lord said to me,  
“A conspiracy has been found among the people of Judah and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

## Jeremiah 11:10  
They have turned back to the wrongdoings of their ancestors who refused to listen to My words,  
And they have followed other gods to serve them.  
The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken My covenant which I made with their forefathers.”

## Jeremiah 11:11  
Therefore this is what the Lord says:  
“Behold, I am bringing disaster on them which they will not be able to escape;  
Though they will cry out to Me, I will not listen to them.

## Jeremiah 11:12  
Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods to whom they burn incense,  
But they will not save them at all in the time of their disaster.

## Jeremiah 11:13  
For your gods are as many as your cities, Judah;  
And as many as the streets of Jerusalem are the altars you have set up to the shameful thing—altars for burning incense to Baal.

## Jeremiah 11:14  
“So as for you, do not pray for this people, nor lift up a cry or prayer for them;  
For I will not listen when they call to Me because of their disaster.

## Jeremiah 11:15  
What right has My beloved in My house,  
When she has done many vile deeds?  
Can the sacrificial meat take away your disaster,  
So that you can rejoice?”

## Jeremiah 11:16  
The Lord named you “A green olive tree, beautiful in fruit and form”;  
With the noise of a great tumult  
He has set fire to it,  
And its branches are worthless.

## Jeremiah 11:17  
The Lord of armies, who planted you, has pronounced evil against you  
Because of the evil of the house of Israel and the house of Judah,  
Which they have done to provoke Me by offering sacrifices to Baal.

## Jeremiah 11:18  
Moreover, the Lord made it known to me and I knew it;  
Then You showed me their deeds.

## Jeremiah 11:19  
But I was like a gentle lamb led to the slaughter;  
And I did not know that they had devised plots against me, saying,  
“Let’s destroy the tree with its fruit,  
And let’s cut him off from the land of the living,  
So that his name will no longer be remembered.”

## Jeremiah 11:20  
But, Lord of armies, who judges righteously,  
Who puts the feelings and the heart to the test,  
Let me see Your vengeance on them,  
For to You I have committed my cause.

## Jeremiah 11:21  
Therefore this is what the Lord says concerning the people of Anathoth,  
Who are seeking your life, saying,  
“You are not to prophesy in the name of the Lord,  
So that you do not die at our hand”—

## Jeremiah 11:22  
Therefore, this is what the Lord of armies says:  
“Behold, I am going to punish them!  
The young men will die by the sword,  
Their sons and daughters will die by famine;

## Jeremiah 11:23  
And a remnant will not be left to them,  
Because I will bring disaster on the people of Anathoth—  
The year of their punishment.”
