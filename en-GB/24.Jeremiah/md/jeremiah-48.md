# Jeremiah Chapter 48

## Jeremiah 48:1
Concerning Moab. This is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: “Woe to Nebo, for it will be destroyed; Kiriathaim will be put to shame and captured; the stronghold will be disgraced and shattered.

## Jeremiah 48:2
Moab will no longer be praised; in Heshbon they plot her downfall: ‘Come, let us cut her off from being a nation.’ You too, people of Madmen, will be silenced; the sword will pursue you.

## Jeremiah 48:3
A cry of anguish arises from Horonaim, ‘Devastation and great destruction!’

## Jeremiah 48:4
Moab is broken; her little ones have cried out in distress.

## Jeremiah 48:5
They ascend the hill to Luhith, weeping bitterly as they go; at the descent to Horonaim they hear anguished cries of destruction.

## Jeremiah 48:6
Flee! Save your lives; become like a bush in the wilderness.

## Jeremiah 48:7
Because you trust in your deeds and riches, you too will be captured, and Chemosh will go into exile, together with his priests and officials.

## Jeremiah 48:8
The destroyer will come to every town, and not a town will escape. The valley will be ruined and the plateau destroyed, as the Lord has spoken.

## Jeremiah 48:9
Give wings to Moab, for she will be laid waste; her towns will become desolate, with no inhabitants.

## Jeremiah 48:10
Cursed is anyone who does the Lord’s work negligently! Cursed is anyone who holds back their sword from bloodshed!

## Jeremiah 48:11
“Moab has been at ease from youth, like wine settled on its dregs, not poured from vessel to vessel— she has not gone into exile. So she retains her flavour, and her aroma is unchanged.

## Jeremiah 48:12
But days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when I will send those who tip vessels, and they will tip her over; they will empty her jars and smash them.

## Jeremiah 48:13
Then Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed when they trusted in Bethel.

## Jeremiah 48:14
How can you say, ‘We are warriors, men valiant in battle’?

## Jeremiah 48:15
Moab will be destroyed and her towns invaded; her finest young men will go down in the slaughter,” declares the King, whose name is the Lord of Hosts.

## Jeremiah 48:16
“The disaster of Moab is near at hand; her calamity will come quickly.

## Jeremiah 48:17
Mourn for her, all who live around her, all who know her name; say, ‘How broken is the mighty sceptre, how broken the glorious staff!’

## Jeremiah 48:18
Come down from your glory and sit on the parched ground, you inhabitants of Daughter Dibon, for the destroyer of Moab will come up against you and ruin your fortified cities.

## Jeremiah 48:19
Stand by the road and watch, you who live in Aroer. Ask the man fleeing and the woman escaping, ‘What has happened?’

## Jeremiah 48:20
Moab is disgraced, for she is shattered. Wail and cry out! Announce by the Arnon that Moab is destroyed.

## Jeremiah 48:21
Judgement has come to the plateau— to Holon, Jahzah and Mephaath,

## Jeremiah 48:22
to Dibon, Nebo and Beth Diblathaim,

## Jeremiah 48:23
to Kiriathaim, Beth Gamul and Beth Meon,

## Jeremiah 48:24
to Kerioth and Bozrah— to all the towns of Moab, far and near.

## Jeremiah 48:25
Moab’s horn is cut off; her arm is broken,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 48:26
“Make her drunk, for she has defied the Lord. Let Moab wallow in her vomit; let her become a laughingstock.

## Jeremiah 48:27
Was not Israel a laughingstock to you? Was she caught among thieves, that you shake your head in scorn whenever you speak of her?

## Jeremiah 48:28
Leave the towns and dwell among the rocks, you who live in Moab. Be like a dove that nests at the mouth of a cave.

## Jeremiah 48:29
We have heard of Moab’s pride—how great is her arrogance!— of her insolence, her pride, her conceit and the haughtiness of her heart.

## Jeremiah 48:30
I know her insolence,” declares the Lord, “but it is futile; her boasts accomplish nothing.

## Jeremiah 48:31
Therefore I wail over Moab, for all Moab I cry out, I moan for the people of Kir Hareseth.

## Jeremiah 48:32
I weep for you, as Jazer weeps, you vines of Sibmah. Your branches spread across the sea; they reached as far as Jazer. The destroyer has fallen on your ripened fruit and grapes.

## Jeremiah 48:33
Joy and gladness are gone from the orchards and fields of Moab. I have stopped the flow of wine from the presses; no one treads them with shouts of joy. Although there are shouts, they are not shouts of joy.

## Jeremiah 48:34
The sound of their cry rises from Heshbon to Elealeh and Jahaz, from Zoar as far as Horonaim and Eglath Shelishiyah, for even the waters of Nimrim are dried up.

## Jeremiah 48:35
In Moab I will put an end to those who make offerings on the high places and burn incense to their gods,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 48:36
“So my heart laments for Moab like the music of flutes; it laments like a pipe for the people of Kir Hareseth. The wealth they acquired is gone.

## Jeremiah 48:37
Every head is shaved and every beard cut off; there are gashes on all the hands and sackcloth around the waists.

## Jeremiah 48:38
On all the roofs in Moab and in the public squares there is nothing but mourning, for I have broken Moab like a jar that no one wants,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 48:39
“How shattered she is! How they wail! How Moab turns her back in shame! Moab has become a laughingstock, an object of horror to all those around her.”

## Jeremiah 48:40
This is what the Lord says: “Behold, an eagle is swooping down, spreading its wings over Moab.

## Jeremiah 48:41
Kerioth will be captured and the strongholds taken. In that day the hearts of Moab’s warriors will be like the heart of a woman in labour.

## Jeremiah 48:42
Moab will be destroyed as a nation because she defied the Lord.

## Jeremiah 48:43
Terror, pit, and snare await you, people of Moab,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 48:44
“Whoever flees from the terror will fall into a pit, and whoever climbs out of the pit will be caught in a snare; for I will bring on Moab the year of her punishment,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 48:45
“In the shadow of Heshbon the fugitives stand helpless, for a fire has gone out from Heshbon, a blaze from the midst of Sihon; it burns the foreheads of Moab, the skulls of the noisy boasters.

## Jeremiah 48:46
Woe to you, Moab! The people of Chemosh are destroyed; your sons are taken into exile and your daughters into captivity.

## Jeremiah 48:47
“Yet I will restore the fortunes of Moab in the latter days,” declares the Lord. Here ends the judgement on Moab.
