# Jeremiah Chapter 25

## Jeremiah 25:1
The message came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, which was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.

## Jeremiah 25:2
The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying:

## Jeremiah 25:3
“From the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah, even until this day, these twenty-three years the word of the Lord has come to me, and I have spoken to you persistently, but you have not listened.

## Jeremiah 25:4
And the Lord has sent to you all his servants the prophets persistently, but you have not listened or inclined your ear to hear,

## Jeremiah 25:5
saying, ‘Turn now, each of you, from your evil ways and from the evil of your deeds, and dwell in the land that the Lord has given to you and your ancestors for ever and ever;

## Jeremiah 25:6
and do not follow other gods to serve and worship them, and do not provoke me to anger with the work of your hands, then I will do you no harm.’

## Jeremiah 25:7
Yet you have not listened to me,” declares the Lord, “in order to provoke me to anger with the work of your hands to your own harm.

## Jeremiah 25:8
Therefore this is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘Because you have not obeyed my words,

## Jeremiah 25:9
behold, I will summon all the peoples of the north,’ declares the Lord, ‘and I will send for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, my servant, and bring them against this land and its inhabitants and against all these surrounding nations. I will utterly destroy them and make them an object of horror and scorn, and an everlasting desolation.

## Jeremiah 25:10
Moreover, I will silence from them the voice of joy and gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the bride, the sound of the millstones and the light of the lamp.

## Jeremiah 25:11
This whole land will become a desolate wasteland, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon for seventy years.

## Jeremiah 25:12
But when the seventy years are completed, I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation,’ declares the Lord, ‘for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and make it an everlasting desolation.

## Jeremiah 25:13
I will bring upon that land all the words I have pronounced against it, all that is written in this book which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.

## Jeremiah 25:14
They themselves will be enslaved by many nations and great kings; I will repay them according to their deeds and the work of their hands.’”

## Jeremiah 25:15
For this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, said to me: “Take this cup of the wine of my wrath from my hand and make all the nations to whom I send you drink it.

## Jeremiah 25:16
When they drink it, they will stagger and go mad because of the sword I am sending among them.”

## Jeremiah 25:17
So I took the cup from the Lord’s hand and made all the nations to whom he sent me drink it:

## Jeremiah 25:18
Jerusalem and the towns of Judah, its kings and officials, to make them a ruin and an object of horror, scorn, and a curse, as it is today;

## Jeremiah 25:19
Pharaoh king of Egypt, his servants, his officials, and all his people;

## Jeremiah 25:20
and all the foreign people there; all the kings of the land of Uz; all the kings of the land of the Philistines (those of Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod);

## Jeremiah 25:21
Edom, Moab, and the sons of Ammon;

## Jeremiah 25:22
all the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the coastlands across the sea;

## Jeremiah 25:23
Dedan, Tema, Buz, and all who have the corners of their hair cut;

## Jeremiah 25:24
all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the foreign people who live in the desert;

## Jeremiah 25:25
all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of Media;

## Jeremiah 25:26
and all the kings of the north, near and far, one after another—all the kingdoms on the face of the earth. And after all of them, the king of Sheshak will drink it too.

## Jeremiah 25:27
“Then you shall say to them, ‘This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: Drink, be drunk, vomit, and fall to rise no more because of the sword I am sending among you.’

## Jeremiah 25:28
But if they refuse to take the cup from your hand and drink, say to them, ‘This is what the Lord Almighty says: You must certainly drink it!

## Jeremiah 25:29
See, I am beginning to bring disaster on the city that bears my Name, and will you indeed go unpunished? You will not go unpunished, for I am summoning a sword against all who live on the earth,’ declares the Lord Almighty.

## Jeremiah 25:30
“Therefore you shall prophesy against them all these words, and say to them: ‘The Lord will roar from on high; he will thunder from his holy dwelling and roar mightily against his land. He will shout like those who tread the grapes, against all who live on the earth.

## Jeremiah 25:31
The noise will resound to the ends of the earth, for the Lord has a controversy with the nations; he will bring judgment on all humanity and put the wicked to the sword,’ declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 25:32
This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘Look! Disaster is spreading from nation to nation; a mighty storm is rising from the farthest parts of the earth.’

## Jeremiah 25:33
At that time those slain by the Lord will be everywhere—from one end of the earth to the other. They will not be mourned, gathered, or buried, but will be like dung on the ground.

## Jeremiah 25:34
Wail, you shepherds, and cry out; roll in the dust, you leaders of the flock. For your time to be slaughtered has come; you will fall like the finest of the rams.

## Jeremiah 25:35
The shepherds will have nowhere to flee, the leaders of the flock no place to escape.

## Jeremiah 25:36
Listen to the cry of the shepherds, the wailing of the leaders of the flock, for the Lord is destroying their pasture.

## Jeremiah 25:37
The peaceful meadows will be laid waste because of the fierce anger of the Lord.

## Jeremiah 25:38
Like a lion he has left his lair; for their land has become desolate because of the oppressing sword and because of the Lord’s fierce anger.
