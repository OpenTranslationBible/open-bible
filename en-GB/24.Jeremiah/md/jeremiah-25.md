# Jeremiah Chapter 25

## Jeremiah 25:1  
The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (that was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon),

## Jeremiah 25:2  
the prophet Jeremiah spoke to all the people of Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying,

## Jeremiah 25:3  
“From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, even to this day, these twenty-three years the word of the Lord has come to me, and I have spoken to you again and again, but you have not listened.

## Jeremiah 25:4  
And the Lord has sent to you all His servants the prophets again and again, but you have not listened nor inclined your ear to hear,

## Jeremiah 25:5  
saying, ‘Turn now, everyone, from his evil way and from the evil of your deeds, and live on the land which the Lord has given to you and your forefathers forever and ever;

## Jeremiah 25:6  
and do not follow other gods to serve them and to worship them, and do not provoke Me to anger with the work of your hands, and I will do you no harm.’

## Jeremiah 25:7  
Yet you have not listened to Me,” declares the Lord, “so as to provoke Me to anger with the work of your hands to your own harm.

## Jeremiah 25:8  
Therefore this is what the Lord of armies says: ‘Because you have not obeyed My words,

## Jeremiah 25:9  
behold, I will send and take all the families of the north,’ declares the Lord, ‘and I will send to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, My servant, and will bring them against this land and its inhabitants, and against all these surrounding nations;  
and I will completely destroy them and make them an object of horror and of hissing, and an everlasting desolation.

## Jeremiah 25:10  
Moreover, I will eliminate from them the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the groom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones and the light of the lamp.

## Jeremiah 25:11  
This entire land will be a place of ruins and an object of horror, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon for seventy years.

## Jeremiah 25:12  
Then it will be, when seventy years are completed, that I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation,’ declares the Lord, ‘for their wrongdoing, and the land of the Chaldeans; and I will make it an everlasting desolation.

## Jeremiah 25:13  
I will bring on that land all My words which I have spoken against it, everything that is written in this book, which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.

## Jeremiah 25:14  
(For many nations and great kings will make slaves of them, even them; and I will repay them according to their deeds and according to the work of their hands.)’”

## Jeremiah 25:15  
For this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says to me: “Take this cup of the wine of wrath from My hand and make all the nations to whom I send you drink it.

## Jeremiah 25:16  
Then they will drink and stagger and go insane because of the sword that I will send among them.”

## Jeremiah 25:17  
So I took the cup from the hand of the Lord and made all the nations to whom the Lord sent me drink it:

## Jeremiah 25:18  
Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, and its kings and its officials, to make them a ruin, an object of horror, a hissing, and a curse, as it is this day;

## Jeremiah 25:19  
Pharaoh king of Egypt, his servants, his officials, and all his people;

## Jeremiah 25:20  
and all the foreign people, all the kings of the land of Uz, all the kings of the land of the Philistines (Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod);

## Jeremiah 25:21  
Edom, Moab, and the sons of Ammon;

## Jeremiah 25:22  
and all the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the coastlands which are across the sea;

## Jeremiah 25:23  
and Dedan, Tema, Buz, and all who cut the corners of their hair;

## Jeremiah 25:24  
and all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the foreign people who live in the desert;

## Jeremiah 25:25  
and all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of Media;

## Jeremiah 25:26  
and all the kings of the north, near and far, one with another; and all the kingdoms of the earth which are on the face of the ground; and the king of Sheshak shall drink after them.

## Jeremiah 25:27  
“You shall say to them, ‘This is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel says: “Drink, be drunk, vomit, fall, and rise no more because of the sword which I am going to send among you.”’

## Jeremiah 25:28  
And if they refuse to take the cup from your hand to drink, then you shall say to them, ‘This is what the Lord of armies says: “You shall certainly drink!

## Jeremiah 25:29  
For behold, I am beginning to inflict disaster on this city which is called by My name, and shall you be completely free from punishment?  
You will not be exempt from punishment, for I am summoning a sword against all the inhabitants of the earth,” declares the Lord of armies.’

## Jeremiah 25:30  
Now you are to prophesy all these words against them and say to them,  
‘The Lord will roar from on high  
And raise His voice from His holy dwelling;  
He will roar forcefully against His fold.  
He will shout like those who tread the grapes,  
Against all the inhabitants of the earth.

## Jeremiah 25:31  
A clamor has come to the end of the earth,  
Because the Lord has a controversy with the nations.  
He is entering into judgment with humanity;  
As for the wicked, He has turned them over to the sword,’ declares the Lord.”

## Jeremiah 25:32  
This is what the Lord of armies says:  
“Behold, evil is going forth  
From nation to nation,  
And a great storm is being stirred up  
From the remotest parts of the earth.

## Jeremiah 25:33  
Those put to death by the Lord on that day will be from one end of the earth to the other.  
They will not be mourned, collected, or buried;  
They will be like dung on the surface of the ground.

## Jeremiah 25:34  
Wail, you shepherds, and cry out;  
Wallow in the dust, you masters of the flock;  
For the days of your slaughter and your dispersions have come,  
And you will fall like a precious vessel.

## Jeremiah 25:35  
Flight will perish from the shepherds,  
And escape from the masters of the flock.

## Jeremiah 25:36  
Hear the sound of the cry of the shepherds,  
And the wailing of the masters of the flock!  
For the Lord is destroying their pasture,

## Jeremiah 25:37  
And the peaceful grazing places are devastated  
Because of the fierce anger of the Lord.

## Jeremiah 25:38  
He has left His hiding place like the lion;  
For their land has become a desolation  
Because of the sword of the oppressor,  
And because of His fierce anger.
