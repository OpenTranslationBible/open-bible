# Jeremiah Chapter 42

## Jeremiah 42:1
Then all the commanders of the forces, including Johanan son of Kareah and Jezaniah son of Hoshaiah, along with all the people from the least to the greatest, approached

## Jeremiah 42:2
and said to Jeremiah the prophet, “Please let our plea be heard, and pray to the Lord your God for this entire remnant. As you can see, we are left only a few out of many.

## Jeremiah 42:3
Pray that the Lord your God will show us the way we should walk and what we should do.”

## Jeremiah 42:4
Jeremiah the prophet replied, “I have heard you. I will pray to the Lord your God as you have requested, and I will convey to you the whole message the Lord gives me, without holding anything back.”

## Jeremiah 42:5
Then they said to Jeremiah, “May the Lord be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not act according to every word the Lord your God sends you to tell us.

## Jeremiah 42:6
Whether it is favourable or unfavourable, we will listen to the voice of the Lord our God, to whom we are sending you, so that it may go well with us when we obey the voice of the Lord our God.”

## Jeremiah 42:7
At the end of ten days, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah.

## Jeremiah 42:8
So he called Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces who were with him, and all the people from the least to the greatest.

## Jeremiah 42:9
He said to them, “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your plea, says:

## Jeremiah 42:10
‘If you remain in this land, I will build you up and not tear you down; I will plant you and not uproot you, for I have relented concerning the disaster I have brought upon you.

## Jeremiah 42:11
Do not fear the king of Babylon, whom you now fear. Do not be afraid of him, declares the Lord, for I am with you to save you and deliver you from his hand.

## Jeremiah 42:12
I will show you compassion so that he will have mercy on you and restore you to your own land.’

## Jeremiah 42:13
But if you say, ‘We will not stay in this land,’ thereby disobeying the voice of the Lord your God,

## Jeremiah 42:14
and if you say, ‘No, we will go to Egypt, where we will not see war, hear the sound of the trumpet, or hunger for bread,’

## Jeremiah 42:15
then listen to the word of the Lord, you remnant of Judah. This is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘If you are determined to go to Egypt and settle there,

## Jeremiah 42:16
then the sword you fear will find you there, and the famine you dread will reach you in Egypt, and there you will perish.

## Jeremiah 42:17
Indeed, all who are resolved to go to Egypt to reside there will die by the sword, famine, and plague; not one will survive or escape the disaster I will bring upon them.’

## Jeremiah 42:18
This is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘As my anger and wrath have been poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so my wrath will be poured out on you when you enter Egypt. You will become a curse, an object of horror, an imprecation, and a disgrace; you will never see this place again.’

## Jeremiah 42:19
The Lord has spoken to you, remnant of Judah, ‘Do not go to Egypt!’ Be certain of this: I have warned you today.

## Jeremiah 42:20
You have deceived yourselves, for you sent me to the Lord your God, saying, ‘Pray for us to the Lord our God; tell us all that the Lord our God says, and we will do it.’

## Jeremiah 42:21
I have told you today, but you have not obeyed the Lord your God in all that he sent me to tell you.

## Jeremiah 42:22
So now, be assured of this: You will die by the sword, famine, and plague in the place where you desire to go and settle.”
