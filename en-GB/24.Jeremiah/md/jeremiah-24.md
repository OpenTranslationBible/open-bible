# Jeremiah Chapter 24

## Jeremiah 24:1

After Jehoiachin, the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, along with the officials and the craftsmen and artisans of Judah, were carried into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, the Lord showed me two baskets of figs placed before the temple of the Lord.

## Jeremiah 24:2

One basket contained very good figs, like those that ripen early; the other basket contained very bad figs, so bad they could not be eaten due to their rottenness.

## Jeremiah 24:3

Then the Lord asked me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?” I replied, “Figs: the good ones are very good, but the bad ones are so bad they cannot be eaten.”

## Jeremiah 24:4

The message from the Lord came to me, saying,

## Jeremiah 24:5

“This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘Like these good figs, I will regard as good the exiles from Judah, whom I have sent away from this place to the land of the Chaldeans.

## Jeremiah 24:6

I will watch over them for their good, and I will bring them back to this land. I will build them up and not tear them down; I will plant them and not uproot them.

## Jeremiah 24:7

I will grant them an understanding heart to Recognise Me as the Lord. They will be My people, and I will be their God, for they will return to Me wholeheartedly.

## Jeremiah 24:8

‘But like the bad figs, which cannot be eaten due to their rottenness,’ says the Lord, ‘so will I treat Zedekiah, king of Judah, his officials, and the remnant of Jerusalem, whether they remain in this land or dwell in Egypt.

## Jeremiah 24:9

I will make them an object of horror and a disgrace to all the kingdoms of the earth, a reproach and a byword, a taunt and a curse, wherever I scatter them.

## Jeremiah 24:10

I will bring the sword, famine, and plague upon them until they are removed from the land I gave to them and their ancestors.
