# Jeremiah Chapter 26

## Jeremiah 26:1
At the start of Jehoiakim's reign, son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came from the Lord:

## Jeremiah 26:2
“This is what the Lord says: Stand in the courtyard of the Lord’s house and proclaim to all the towns of Judah who come to worship in the Lord’s house all the words I command you to speak to them. Do not leave out a single word.

## Jeremiah 26:3
Perhaps they will listen and each person will turn from their evil way. Then I will relent from the disaster I intend to bring upon them due to the evil of their deeds.

## Jeremiah 26:4
Say to them, ‘This is what the Lord says: If you do not listen to me and follow my law, which I have set before you,

## Jeremiah 26:5
and if you do not heed the words of my servants the prophets, whom I have sent to you persistently, though you have not listened,

## Jeremiah 26:6
then I will make this house like Shiloh, and this city will become a curse among all the nations of the earth.’”

## Jeremiah 26:7
The priests, the prophets, and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the Lord.

## Jeremiah 26:8
When Jeremiah finished delivering all the words the Lord had commanded him to speak to all the people, the priests, the prophets, and all the people seized him, saying, “You must die!

## Jeremiah 26:9
Why do you prophesy in the Lord’s name that this house will be like Shiloh, and this city will be desolate and without inhabitants?” And all the people gathered around Jeremiah in the house of the Lord.

## Jeremiah 26:10
When the officials of Judah heard these things, they went up from the king’s house to the house of the Lord and took their seats at the entrance of the New Gate of the Lord’s house.

## Jeremiah 26:11
Then the priests and the prophets said to the officials and to all the people, “This man deserves a death sentence because he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your own ears!”

## Jeremiah 26:12
Then Jeremiah said to all the officials and all the people: “The Lord sent me to prophesy against this house and this city all the words you have heard.

## Jeremiah 26:13
Now reform your ways and your deeds and obey the Lord your God. Then the Lord will relent from the disaster he has pronounced against you.

## Jeremiah 26:14
As for me, I am in your hands; do with me as you see fit and right.

## Jeremiah 26:15
But be sure of this, if you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city and its inhabitants, for in truth the Lord has sent me to you to speak all these words in your hearing.”

## Jeremiah 26:16
Then the officials and all the people said to the priests and the prophets, “This man does not deserve a death sentence, for he has spoken to us in the name of the Lord our God.”

## Jeremiah 26:17
Some of the elders of the land stood up and addressed the entire assembly of the people,

## Jeremiah 26:18
“Micah of Moresheth prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah. He declared to all the people of Judah, ‘This is what the Lord of Hosts says: “‘Zion will be ploughed like a field, Jerusalem will become a heap of ruins, and the temple hill a thicket of trees.’

## Jeremiah 26:19
Did Hezekiah king of Judah or anyone in Judah put him to death? Did not Hezekiah fear the Lord and seek his favour? And did not the Lord relent of the disaster he had pronounced against them? We are about to bring a great evil upon ourselves!”

## Jeremiah 26:20
Now there was also a man who prophesied in the name of the Lord, Uriah son of Shemaiah from Kiriath Jearim, and he prophesied against this city and this land in words similar to those of Jeremiah.

## Jeremiah 26:21
When King Jehoiakim and all his officers and officials heard his words, the king sought to put him to death. But Uriah heard of it and fled in fear to Egypt.

## Jeremiah 26:22
King Jehoiakim, however, sent men to Egypt: Elnathan son of Akbor and others with him.

## Jeremiah 26:23
They brought Uriah out of Egypt and took him to King Jehoiakim, who struck him down with a sword and his body was thrown into the burial place of the common people.

## Jeremiah 26:24
Nevertheless, Ahikam son of Shaphan supported Jeremiah, so he was not handed over to the people to be put to death.
