# Jeremiah Chapter 19

## Jeremiah 19:1
This is what the Lord says: “Go and purchase a clay jar from a potter, and take some of the elders of the people and some of the senior priests.

## Jeremiah 19:2
Then proceed to the Valley of Ben-Hinnom, near the entrance of the Potsherd Gate, and there proclaim the words I instruct you,

## Jeremiah 19:3
and say, ‘Hear the word of the Lord, you kings of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem. This is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Behold, I am about to bring a calamity upon this place which will cause the ears of everyone who hears of it to tingle.

## Jeremiah 19:4
For they have abandoned Me and have made this place alien, burning incense in it to gods neither they nor their ancestors nor the kings of Judah have known, and they have filled this place with the blood of the innocent.

## Jeremiah 19:5
They have constructed the high places of Baal to burn their children in the fire as offerings to Baal—something I did not command, nor speak of, nor did it enter My mind.

## Jeremiah 19:6
Therefore, behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when this place will no longer be called Topheth or the Valley of Ben-Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter.

## Jeremiah 19:7
In this place, I will thwart the plans of Judah and Jerusalem. I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, by the hands of those who seek their lives, and I will give their carcasses as food to the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth.

## Jeremiah 19:8
I will make this city a desolation and an object of derision; everyone who passes by will be appalled and will hiss because of all its wounds.

## Jeremiah 19:9
I will make them consume the flesh of their sons and daughters, and they will eat one another’s flesh due to the siege and the distress with which their enemies, those who seek their lives, will afflict them.’

## Jeremiah 19:10
Then break the jar in the presence of those who accompany you,

## Jeremiah 19:11
and say to them, ‘This is what the Lord of Hosts says: I will shatter this people and this city just as one breaks a potter’s vessel, which cannot be repaired; and they will bury their dead in Topheth until there is no more room.

## Jeremiah 19:12
This is what I will do to this place and its inhabitants, declares the Lord, making this city like Topheth.

## Jeremiah 19:13
The houses in Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah will be defiled like this place, Topheth—all the houses on whose rooftops they burned incense to all the starry hosts and poured out drink offerings to other gods.’”

## Jeremiah 19:14
Then Jeremiah returned from Topheth, where the Lord had sent him to prophesy, and he stood in the courtyard of the Lord’s house and spoke to all the people,

## Jeremiah 19:15
“This is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Behold, I am going to bring on this city and all its surrounding towns every disaster I have pronounced against them, because they have stiffened their necks and have not listened to My words.”
