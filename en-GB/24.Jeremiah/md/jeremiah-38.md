# Jeremiah Chapter 38

## Jeremiah 38:1  
Now Shephatiah the son of Mattan, Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the son of Malchijah heard the words that Jeremiah was speaking to all the people, saying,

## Jeremiah 38:2  
“This is what the Lord says: ‘Anyone who stays in this city will die by the sword, by famine, or by plague;  
but anyone who goes out to the Chaldeans will live, and will have his own life as plunder, and stay alive.’

## Jeremiah 38:3  
This is what the Lord says: ‘This city will certainly be handed over to the army of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it.’”

## Jeremiah 38:4  
Then the officials said to the king, “Please have this man put to death,  
because he is discouraging the men of war who are left in this city and all the people, by speaking such words to them.  
For this man is not seeking the well-being of these people, but rather their harm.”

## Jeremiah 38:5  
So King Zedekiah said, “Behold, he is in your hands; for the king can do nothing against you.”

## Jeremiah 38:6  
So they took Jeremiah and threw him into the cistern of Malchijah the king’s son, which was in the courtyard of the guardhouse;  
and they let Jeremiah down with ropes.  
Now in the cistern there was no water but only mud, and Jeremiah sank into the mud.

## Jeremiah 38:7  
But Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch who was in the king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern.  
Now the king was sitting at the Gate of Benjamin;

## Jeremiah 38:8  
and Ebed-melech went out from the king’s house and spoke to the king, saying,

## Jeremiah 38:9  
“My lord the king, these men have acted wickedly in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet,  
whom they have thrown into the cistern; he will die there of hunger, for there is no more bread in the city.”

## Jeremiah 38:10  
Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying,  
“Take thirty men from here under your authority and bring up Jeremiah the prophet from the cistern before he dies.”

## Jeremiah 38:11  
So Ebed-melech took the men under his authority and went into the king’s house to a place beneath the storeroom,  
and took from there worn-out rags and worn-out clothes, and let them down by ropes into the cistern to Jeremiah.

## Jeremiah 38:12  
Then Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah,  
“Now put these worn-out rags and clothes under your armpits under the ropes”;  
and Jeremiah did so.

## Jeremiah 38:13  
So they pulled Jeremiah out with the ropes and lifted him out of the cistern, and Jeremiah stayed in the courtyard of the guardhouse.

## Jeremiah 38:14  
Then King Zedekiah sent word and had Jeremiah the prophet brought to him at the third entrance that is in the house of the Lord;  
and the king said to Jeremiah, “I am going to ask you something; do not hide anything from me.”

## Jeremiah 38:15  
Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I tell you, will you not certainly put me to death?  
And if I give you advice, you will not listen to me.”

## Jeremiah 38:16  
But King Zedekiah swore to Jeremiah in secret, saying,  
“As the Lord lives, who gave us this life, I will not put you to death,  
nor will I hand you over to these men who are seeking your life.”

## Jeremiah 38:17  
Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “This is what the Lord, the God of armies, the God of Israel says:  
‘If you will indeed surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, then you will live, this city will not be burned with fire, and you and your household will survive.

## Jeremiah 38:18  
But if you do not surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, then this city will be handed over to the Chaldeans,  
and they will burn it with fire, and you yourself will not escape from their hand.’”

## Jeremiah 38:19  
Then King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Jews who have deserted to the Chaldeans,  
for they may hand me over to them, and they will abuse me.”

## Jeremiah 38:20  
But Jeremiah said, “They will not hand you over.  
Please obey the voice of the Lord in what I am saying to you, so that it may go well for you and you may live.

## Jeremiah 38:21  
But if you keep refusing to surrender, this is the word which the Lord has shown me:

## Jeremiah 38:22  
‘Behold, all the women who remain in the palace of the king of Judah will be brought out to the officers of the king of Babylon, and those women will say,  
“Your trusted friends have misled and overpowered you;  
While your feet were sunk in the mud, they turned back.”

## Jeremiah 38:23  
They will also bring out all your wives and your sons to the Chaldeans,  
and you yourself will not escape from their hand, but will be seized by the hand of the king of Babylon,  
and this city will be burned with fire.’”

## Jeremiah 38:24  
Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Let no one know about these words, and you will not die.

## Jeremiah 38:25  
But if the officials hear that I have spoken with you and come to you and say to you,  
‘Tell us now what you said to the king, and what the king said to you; do not hide it from us, and we will not put you to death,’

## Jeremiah 38:26  
then you are to say to them,  
‘I was presenting my plea before the king, not to have me return to the house of Jonathan to die there.’”

## Jeremiah 38:27  
Then all the officials came to Jeremiah and questioned him, and he told them in accordance with all these words which the king had commanded;  
so they stopped speaking with him, since the conversation had not been overheard.

## Jeremiah 38:28  
So Jeremiah stayed in the courtyard of the guardhouse until the day that Jerusalem was captured.
