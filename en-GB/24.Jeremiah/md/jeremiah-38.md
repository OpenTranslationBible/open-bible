# Jeremiah Chapter 38

## Jeremiah 38:1
Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jehukal son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son of Malchijah heard the words that Jeremiah was speaking to all the people, saying,

## Jeremiah 38:2
“This is what the Lord says: ‘Whoever stays in this city will die by the sword, famine, or plague, but whoever surrenders to the Chaldeans will live. They will escape with their lives and will live.’

## Jeremiah 38:3
This is what the Lord says: ‘This city will certainly be given into the hands of the army of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it.’”

## Jeremiah 38:4
Then the officials said to the king, “This man should be put to death, for he is discouraging the soldiers who remain in this city, as well as all the people, by speaking these words to them. This man is not seeking the well-being of this people, but rather their harm.”

## Jeremiah 38:5
King Zedekiah said, “Behold, he is in your hands; the king can do nothing to oppose you.”

## Jeremiah 38:6
So they took Jeremiah and put him into the cistern of Malchijah, the king’s son, which was in the courtyard of the guard. They lowered Jeremiah by ropes into the cistern; it had no water in it, only mud, and Jeremiah sank into the mud.

## Jeremiah 38:7
But Ebed-Melek, a Cushite, an official in the royal palace, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern. Now the king was sitting at the Benjamin Gate;

## Jeremiah 38:8
Ebed-Melek went out from the palace and spoke to the king, saying,

## Jeremiah 38:9
“My lord the king, these men have acted wickedly in all they have done to Jeremiah the prophet. They have thrown him into a cistern, where he will die because of the famine, for there is no more bread in the city.”

## Jeremiah 38:10
Then the king instructed Ebed-Melek the Cushite, “Take thirty men from here with you and bring Jeremiah the prophet up from the cistern before he perishes.”

## Jeremiah 38:11
So Ebed-Melek took the men with him and went to a room under the treasury in the palace. He took some worn-out clothes and rags from there and let them down with ropes to Jeremiah in the cistern.

## Jeremiah 38:12
Ebed-Melek the Cushite said to Jeremiah, “Put these worn-out clothes and rags under your arms to pad the ropes.” And Jeremiah did so,

## Jeremiah 38:13
and they pulled him up with the ropes and brought him out of the cistern. Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard.

## Jeremiah 38:14
Then King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and had him brought to the third entrance to the house of the Lord. The king said to Jeremiah, “I am going to ask you something; do not hide anything from me.”

## Jeremiah 38:15
Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I tell you, will you not certainly put me to death? Even if I give you advice, you will not listen to me.”

## Jeremiah 38:16
But King Zedekiah swore this oath secretly to Jeremiah: “As surely as the Lord lives, who has given us life, I will neither kill you nor hand you over to those who want to kill you.”

## Jeremiah 38:17
Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “This is what the Lord God of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘If you surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, your life will be spared and this city will not be burned; you and your family will live.

## Jeremiah 38:18
But if you do not surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, this city will be given into the hands of the Chaldeans and they will burn it down; you yourself will not escape from them.’”

## Jeremiah 38:19
King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Jews who have gone over to the Chaldeans, for they may hand me over to them and they will mistreat me.”

## Jeremiah 38:20
Jeremiah replied, “They will not hand you over. Obey the Lord by doing what I tell you, so that it may go well with you and you may live.

## Jeremiah 38:21
However, if you choose not to surrender, the Lord has shown me this:

## Jeremiah 38:22
‘Behold, all the women left in the palace of the king of Judah will be brought out to the officials of the king of Babylon. Those women will say to you: “Your close friends have misled and overpowered you. Your feet are sunk in the mud; they have deserted you.”

## Jeremiah 38:23
“All your wives and children will be brought out to the Chaldeans. You yourself will not escape from their hands, but will be captured by the king of Babylon; and this city will be burned down.”

## Jeremiah 38:24
Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Do not let anyone know about this conversation, or you may be at risk.

## Jeremiah 38:25
If the officials hear that I talked with you and come to you and say, ‘Tell us what you said to the king and what the king said to you; do not hide it from us or we will kill you,’

## Jeremiah 38:26
then say to them, ‘I was requesting the king not to send me back to Jonathan’s house to die there.’”

## Jeremiah 38:27
All the officials did come to Jeremiah and questioned him, and he reported to them in accordance with all these words which the king had commanded. So they stopped speaking with him, for no one had overheard the conversation.

## Jeremiah 38:28
And Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard until the day Jerusalem was captured.
