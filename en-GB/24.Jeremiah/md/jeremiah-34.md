# Jeremiah Chapter 34

## Jeremiah 34:1
The message came to Jeremiah from the Lord while Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and all his army, along with all the kingdoms and peoples under his dominion, were waging war against Jerusalem and all its towns:

## Jeremiah 34:2
“This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Go to Zedekiah, king of Judah, and tell him, ‘This is what the Lord says: Behold, I am about to deliver this city into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he will set it ablaze.

## Jeremiah 34:3
You will not escape from his grasp but will certainly be captured and handed over to him. You will see the king of Babylon with your own eyes, and he will converse with you face to face, and you will be taken to Babylon.

## Jeremiah 34:4
Yet hear the word of the Lord, Zedekiah king of Judah! This is what the Lord says concerning you: You will not die by the sword;

## Jeremiah 34:5
you will die peacefully. As spices were burned for your ancestors, the former kings before you, so they will burn spices for you and lament, “Alas, my lord!” I have spoken this word, declares the Lord.’”

## Jeremiah 34:6
Then Jeremiah the prophet relayed all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah, in Jerusalem,

## Jeremiah 34:7
while the army of the king of Babylon was engaged in battle against Jerusalem and the remaining cities of Judah, namely Lachish and Azekah, as these were the only fortified cities left in Judah.

## Jeremiah 34:8
The word came to Jeremiah from the Lord after King Zedekiah had established a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to proclaim liberty for the slaves.

## Jeremiah 34:9
Each person was to free their Hebrew slaves, both male and female, so that no one would hold a fellow Hebrew in servitude.

## Jeremiah 34:10
All the officials and people who had entered into this covenant agreed to release their male and female slaves and no longer keep them in bondage. They complied and set them free.

## Jeremiah 34:11
However, they later changed their minds and took back the slaves they had liberated, forcing them into servitude once more.

## Jeremiah 34:12
Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah:

## Jeremiah 34:13
“This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: I made a covenant with your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying,

## Jeremiah 34:14
‘At the end of seven years, each of you must free any fellow Hebrews who have sold themselves to you. After they have served you for six years, you must release them.’ But your ancestors did not listen to me or pay heed.

## Jeremiah 34:15
Recently, you turned and did what was right in my sight: Each of you proclaimed freedom to your neighbour, and you made a covenant before me in the house that bears my Name.

## Jeremiah 34:16
But now you have turned and profaned my name; each of you has taken back the male and female slaves you had set free to go as they pleased. You have brought them back into subjection as your slaves.

## Jeremiah 34:17
Therefore, this is what the Lord says: You have not obeyed me by proclaiming liberty, each to his brother and neighbour. So now I proclaim ‘liberty’ for you, declares the Lord—‘liberty’ to the sword, to plague, and to famine. I will make you a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.

## Jeremiah 34:18
Those who have violated my covenant and have not fulfilled the terms of the covenant they made before me, I will treat like the calf they cut in two and then passed between its parts.

## Jeremiah 34:19
The leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the court officials, the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf,

## Jeremiah 34:20
I will deliver into the hands of their enemies who seek their lives. Their corpses will become food for the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth.

## Jeremiah 34:21
I will hand over Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials to their enemies who seek their lives, to the army of the king of Babylon, which has withdrawn from you.

## Jeremiah 34:22
Behold, I am going to give the command, declares the Lord, and I will bring them back to this city. They will fight against it, capture it, and set it on fire; and I will make the towns of Judah desolate, without inhabitant.”
