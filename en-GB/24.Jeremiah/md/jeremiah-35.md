# Jeremiah Chapter 35

## Jeremiah 35:1  
The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,

## Jeremiah 35:2  
“Go to the house of the Rechabites and speak to them, and bring them into the house of the Lord, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.”

## Jeremiah 35:3  
So I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, son of Habazziniah, and his brothers and all his sons, and the entire house of the Rechabites,

## Jeremiah 35:4  
and I brought them into the house of the Lord, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was next to the chamber of the officials, above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the doorkeeper.

## Jeremiah 35:5  
Then I set cups and pitchers full of wine before the men of the house of the Rechabites, and I said to them, “Drink wine!”

## Jeremiah 35:6  
But they said, “We will not drink wine, for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying, ‘You shall not drink wine, you or your sons, forever.

## Jeremiah 35:7  
You shall not build a house, you shall not sow seed, and you shall not plant a vineyard or own one;  
but in tents you shall live all your days, so that you may live many days in the land where you reside.’

## Jeremiah 35:8  
We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in everything that he commanded us,  
not to drink wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, or our daughters,

## Jeremiah 35:9  
nor to build ourselves houses to live in; and we do not have vineyard or field or seed.

## Jeremiah 35:10  
We have only lived in tents, and have obeyed and done according to everything that our father Jonadab commanded us.

## Jeremiah 35:11  
But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against the land, we said, ‘Come, and let us go to Jerusalem away from the army of the Chaldeans and the army of the Arameans.’  
So we have lived in Jerusalem.”

## Jeremiah 35:12  
Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying,

## Jeremiah 35:13  
“This is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel says:  
‘Go and say to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem,  
“Will you not accept instruction by listening to My words?” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 35:14  
The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, which he commanded his sons not to drink wine, have been followed, and they do not drink wine to this day, for they have obeyed their father’s command.  
But I have spoken to you again and again; yet you have not listened to Me.

## Jeremiah 35:15  
Also I have sent to you all My servants the prophets, sending them again and again, saying:  
‘Turn now every person from his evil way and reform your deeds, and do not follow other gods to worship them.  
Then you will live in the land which I have given to you and to your forefathers.’  
But you have not inclined your ear nor listened to Me.

## Jeremiah 35:16  
Indeed, the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have followed the command of their father, which he commanded them,  
but this people has not listened to Me.”’

## Jeremiah 35:17  
Therefore this is what the Lord, the God of armies, the God of Israel says:  
‘Behold, I am bringing on Judah and on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the disaster that I have pronounced against them,  
because I spoke to them but they did not listen, and I called them but they did not answer.’”

## Jeremiah 35:18  
Then Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites,  
“This is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel says:  
‘Because you have obeyed the command of your father Jonadab, and kept all his commandments and done according to all that he commanded you,

## Jeremiah 35:19  
Therefore this is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel says:  
“Jonadab the son of Rechab will not lack a man to stand before Me always.”’”
