# Jeremiah Chapter 35

## Jeremiah 35:1

The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord during the reign of Jehoiakim, son of Josiah, king of Judah:

## Jeremiah 35:2

“Go to the house of the Rekabites and speak to them, and bring them into the house of the Lord, into one of the side rooms, and offer them wine to drink.”

## Jeremiah 35:3

So I took Jaazaniah, son of Jeremiah, son of Habazziniah, and his brothers and all his sons, the entire household of the Rekabites,

## Jeremiah 35:4

and brought them into the house of the Lord, into the room of the sons of Hanan, son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was beside the room of the officials, above the room of Maaseiah, son of Shallum, the doorkeeper.

## Jeremiah 35:5

Then I set before the men of the house of the Rekabites bowls full of wine and cups, and said to them, “Drink wine.”

## Jeremiah 35:6

But they replied, “We will not drink wine, for Jonadab, son of Rekab, our forefather, commanded us, ‘You must not drink wine, neither you nor your descendants, forever.

## Jeremiah 35:7

You shall not build houses, sow seed, or plant vineyards, nor own any; but you must live in tents all your days, so that you may live long in the land where you are wanderers.’

## Jeremiah 35:8

We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab, son of Rekab, our forefather, in all he commanded us, not to drink wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, or our daughters,

## Jeremiah 35:9

nor to build houses to live in, nor do we have vineyards, fields, or crops.

## Jeremiah 35:10

We have lived in tents and have obeyed and done all that our forefather Jonadab commanded us.

## Jeremiah 35:11

But when Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, invaded the land, we said, ‘Come, let us go to Jerusalem to escape the armies of the Chaldeans and the Arameans.’ So we have remained in Jerusalem.”

## Jeremiah 35:12

The word of the Lord then came to Jeremiah, saying,

## Jeremiah 35:13

“This is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘Go and tell the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, “Will you not learn a lesson and listen to my words?” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 35:14

‘The words of Jonadab, son of Rekab, which he commanded his descendants, not to drink wine, have been observed. To this day they do not drink wine, because they obey their ancestor’s command. But I have spoken to you persistently, yet you have not listened to me.

## Jeremiah 35:15

I have sent all my servants the prophets to you, again and again, saying: “Each of you must turn from your evil ways and amend your deeds; do not follow other gods to serve them. Then you will dwell in the land I have given to you and your ancestors.” But you have not inclined your ear or listened to me.

## Jeremiah 35:16

The descendants of Jonadab, son of Rekab, have carried out the command their forefather gave them, but this people have not listened to me.’

## Jeremiah 35:17

Therefore, this is what the Lord, the God of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘Behold, I am bringing upon Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the disaster I pronounced against them, because I spoke to them, but they did not listen; I called to them, but they did not answer.’”

## Jeremiah 35:18

Then Jeremiah said to the house of the Rekabites, “This is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘Because you have obeyed the command of Jonadab your forefather, and have kept all his instructions and done all he ordered you,

## Jeremiah 35:19

therefore this is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘Jonadab, son of Rekab, will never lack a descendant to stand before me always.’”
