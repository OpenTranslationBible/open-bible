## Jeremiah 6:6
For this is what the Lord of Hosts says: ‘Cut down the trees and build siege ramps against Jerusalem. This city must be punished; it is filled with oppression.

## Jeremiah 6:7
As a well keeps its waters fresh, so she pours out her wickedness. Violence and destruction resound in her; sickness and wounds are ever before me.

This is what the Lord of Hosts says: ‘Let them glean the remnant of Israel as thoroughly as a vine; pass your hand over the branches again, like one gathering grapes.’

## Jeremiah 6:10
To whom can I speak and give warning, that they may hear? Their ears are closed and they cannot listen. The word of the Lord is offensive to them; they take no pleasure in it.

## Jeremiah 6:11
But I am full of the wrath of the Lord, and I cannot hold it in. ‘Pour it out on the children in the street and on the young men gathered together; both husband and wife will be caught in it, and the old, those weighed down with years.

## Jeremiah 6:16
This is what the Lord says: ‘Stand at the crossroads and look; ask for the ancient paths, where the good way is, and walk in it, and you will find rest for your souls. But you said, ‘We will not walk in it.’

## Jeremiah 6:17
I appointed watchmen over you and said, ‘Listen to the sound of the trumpet!’ But you said, ‘We will not listen.’

## Jeremiah 6:18
Therefore hear, you nations, and know, you congregation, what is among them.

## Jeremiah 6:19
Hear, earth: I am bringing disaster on this people, the fruit of their schemes, because they have not listened to my words and have rejected my law.

## Jeremiah 6:20
What do I care about incense from Sheba or sweet cane from a distant land? Your burnt offerings are not acceptable; your sacrifices do not please me.

## Jeremiah 6:21
Therefore, this is what the Lord says: ‘I will place obstacles before this people. Parents and children alike will stumble over them; neighbours and friends will perish.’

## Jeremiah 6:22
This is what the Lord says: ‘Behold, an army is coming from the land of the north; a great nation is being stirred up from the remote parts of the earth.

## Jeremiah 6:23
They are armed with bow and spear; they are cruel and show no mercy. Their voice roars like the sea as they ride on horses, arrayed as a man for battle against you, Daughter Zion.’

## Jeremiah 6:24
We have heard reports about them, and our hands hang limp. Anguish has gripped us, pain like that of a woman in labour.

Do not go out to the fields or walk on the roads, for the enemy has a sword, and there is terror on every side.

## Jeremiah 6:26
Put on sackcloth, my people, and roll in ashes; mourn with bitter wailing as for an only son, for suddenly the destroyer will come upon us.

## Jeremiah 6:27
‘I have made you a tester of metals and my people the ore, that you may observe and test their ways.

## Jeremiah 6:28
They are all stubbornly rebellious, going about as slanderers. They are bronze and iron; they all act corruptly.

## Jeremiah 6:29
The bellows blow fiercely to burn away the lead with fire, but the refining goes on in vain; the wicked are not purged out.

## Jeremiah 6:30
They are called rejected silver, because the Lord has rejected them.”
