# Jeremiah Chapter 12

## Jeremiah 12:1
You are righteous, O Lord, when I present my case to you; yet I wish to discuss matters of justice with you: Why does the path of the wicked prosper? Why do those who deal in treachery live at ease?

## Jeremiah 12:2
You have planted them, and they have taken root; they grow and produce fruit. You are near to their lips but distant from their hearts.

## Jeremiah 12:3
But you know me, Lord; you see me and examine my heart's attitude towards you. Drag them away like sheep for the slaughter, and set them apart for the day of slaughter!

## Jeremiah 12:4
How long will the land mourn and the grass of every field wither? Because of the wickedness of those who dwell in it, the animals and birds have perished. For the people say, “He will not see our final end.”

## Jeremiah 12:5
“If you have raced with men on foot and they have worn you out, how can you compete with horses? If you stumble in a land of peace, how will you manage in the thickets by the Jordan?

## Jeremiah 12:6
Even your brothers and the household of your father, even they have betrayed you; they have raised a loud cry against you. Do not trust them, though they speak kindly to you.”

## Jeremiah 12:7
“I have abandoned my house, I have forsaken my inheritance; I have given the beloved of my soul into the hands of her enemies.

## Jeremiah 12:8
My inheritance has become to me like a lion in the forest; she roars against me; therefore I have come to hate her.

## Jeremiah 12:9
Is my inheritance to me like a speckled bird of prey? Are other birds of prey surrounding and attacking her? Go, gather all the wild beasts; bring them to devour.

## Jeremiah 12:10
Many shepherds have ruined my vineyard, they have trampled down my field; they have turned my pleasant field into a desolate wilderness.

## Jeremiah 12:11
It is made a wasteland, parched and desolate before me; the whole land is laid waste because no one takes it to heart.

## Jeremiah 12:12
On all the barren heights in the wilderness destroyers have come, for the sword of the Lord devours from one end of the land to the other; there is no peace for anyone.

## Jeremiah 12:13
They have sown wheat but have reaped thorns; they have worn themselves out but gained nothing. Be ashamed of your harvest because of the Lord's fierce anger.”

## Jeremiah 12:14
This is what the Lord says concerning all my wicked neighbours who harm the inheritance I have given my people Israel: “Behold, I will uproot them from their land, and I will uproot the house of Judah from among them.

## Jeremiah 12:15
Yet after I have uprooted them, I will again have compassion and will bring each of them back to their own inheritance and their own land.

## Jeremiah 12:16
And if they truly learn the ways of my people and swear by my name, ‘As surely as the Lord lives’—just as they once taught my people to swear by Baal—then they will be established among my people.

## Jeremiah 12:17
But if they do not listen, I will completely uproot and destroy that nation,” declares the Lord.
