# Jeremiah Chapter 7

## Jeremiah 7:1

The message that was given to Jeremiah from the Lord:

## Jeremiah 7:2

“Stand at the entrance of the Lord’s house and there proclaim this message: ‘Hear the word of the Lord, all you people of Judah who enter through these gates to worship the Lord.’

## Jeremiah 7:3

This is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Amend your ways and your deeds, and I will let you dwell in this place.

## Jeremiah 7:4

Do not rely on deceptive words, saying, ‘This is the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord.’

## Jeremiah 7:5

For if you truly amend your ways and your deeds, and practice justice between a person and his neighbour,

## Jeremiah 7:6

if you do not oppress the foreigner, the orphan, or the widow, and do not shed innocent blood in this place, nor follow other gods to your own detriment,

## Jeremiah 7:7

then I will let you dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your ancestors for ever and ever.

## Jeremiah 7:8

Behold, you are trusting in deceptive words that are of no benefit.

## Jeremiah 7:9

Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, burn incense to Baal, and follow other gods that you have not known,

## Jeremiah 7:10

and then come and stand before Me in this house, which is called by My name, and say, ‘We are safe,’ so that you may continue doing all these abominations?

## Jeremiah 7:11

Has this house, which is called by My name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, I have seen it Myself,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 7:12

“But go now to My place that was in Shiloh, where I first made My name dwell, and see what I did to it because of the wickedness of My people Israel.

## Jeremiah 7:13

And now, because you have done all these things,” declares the Lord, “and I spoke to you, speaking persistently, but you did not listen, and I called you but you did not answer,

## Jeremiah 7:14

therefore I will do to the house which is called by My name, in which you trust, and to the place which I gave to you and your fathers, as I did to Shiloh.

## Jeremiah 7:15

I will cast you out of My sight, just as I have cast out all your brethren, all the descendants of Ephraim.

## Jeremiah 7:16

“As for you, do not pray for this people, nor offer any plea or petition for them; do not plead with Me, for I will not hear you.

## Jeremiah 7:17

Can you not see what they are doing in the cities of Judah? Or in the streets of Jerusalem?

## Jeremiah 7:18

The children gather wood, the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead dough to make cakes for the queen of heaven; and they pour out drink offerings to other gods to provoke Me to anger.

## Jeremiah 7:19

Is it Me they are provoking?” declares the Lord. “Is it not themselves, to their own shame?”

## Jeremiah 7:20

Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: “Behold, My anger and My wrath will be poured out on this place, on man and beast, on the trees of the field and the fruit of the ground; and it will burn and not be quenched.”

## Jeremiah 7:21

This is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: “Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices and eat the meat yourselves!

## Jeremiah 7:22

For when I brought your ancestors out of Egypt, I did not merely give them commands concerning burnt offerings and sacrifices,

## Jeremiah 7:23

but I gave them this command: Obey My voice, and I will be your God and you will be My people; and walk in all the ways that I command you, that it may go well with you.

## Jeremiah 7:24

Yet they did not listen or incline their ear, but followed the stubborn inclinations of their evil hearts. They went backward and not forward.

## Jeremiah 7:25

From the time your ancestors left Egypt until now, day after day, again and again I sent you all My servants the prophets.

## Jeremiah 7:26

But they did not listen to Me or incline their ear. They stiffened their neck and did more evil than their ancestors.

## Jeremiah 7:27

“So you shall speak all these words to them, but they will not listen to you; and you shall call to them, but they will not answer.

## Jeremiah 7:28

Therefore say to them, ‘This is the nation that has not obeyed the voice of the Lord their God or accepted discipline. Truth has perished; it has vanished from their lips.

## Jeremiah 7:29

Cut off your hair and throw it away; take up a lamentation on the barren heights, for the Lord has rejected and forsaken the generation of His wrath.

## Jeremiah 7:30

For the people of Judah have done evil in My sight,” declares the Lord. “They have set up their detestable idols in the house which is called by My name, to defile it.

## Jeremiah 7:31

They have built the high places of Topheth in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to burn their sons and daughters in the fire—something I did not command, nor did it come into My mind.

## Jeremiah 7:32

Therefore, behold, the days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when it will no longer be called Topheth or the Valley of Ben Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter, for they will bury in Topheth until there is no more room.

## Jeremiah 7:33

The carcasses of this people will become food for the birds of the sky and the animals of the earth, and no one will frighten them away.

## Jeremiah 7:34

I will bring an end to the sounds of joy and gladness, the voices of bride and bridegroom, in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem, for the land will become desolate.
