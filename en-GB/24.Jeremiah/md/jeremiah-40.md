# Jeremiah Chapter 40

## Jeremiah 40:1
The message that came to Jeremiah from the Lord after Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guard, released him at Ramah. He found Jeremiah bound in chains among all the captives from Jerusalem and Judah who were being taken to Babylon.

## Jeremiah 40:2
The commander of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him, “The Lord your God pronounced this disaster upon this place;

## Jeremiah 40:3
and now the Lord has brought it about, just as He said He would. This has happened because you people sinned against the Lord and did not listen to His voice.

## Jeremiah 40:4
But today, I am freeing you from the chains on your hands. If you wish to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will take care of you; but if you prefer not to come, then do not come. Look, the whole land is before you; go wherever it seems good and right for you to go.”

## Jeremiah 40:5
While Jeremiah had not yet turned to go, Nebuzaradan added, “Go back to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed over the towns of Judah, and stay with him among the people, or go wherever it seems right for you to go.” Then the commander gave him provisions and a gift and let him go.

## Jeremiah 40:6
So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah and stayed with him among the people who were left in the land.

## Jeremiah 40:7
When all the commanders of the forces in the open country and their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam as governor over the land, and had put him in charge of the men, women, and children, those of the poorest in the land who had not been exiled to Babylon,

## Jeremiah 40:8
they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah—along with Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of the Maakathite, and their men.

## Jeremiah 40:9
Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, assured them and their men, saying, “Do not be afraid to serve the Babylonians; settle down in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well with you.

## Jeremiah 40:10
As for me, I will stay at Mizpah to represent you before the Babylonians who come to us, but you are to gather wine, summer fruit, and olive oil, and store them in your jars, and live in the towns you have taken over.”

## Jeremiah 40:11
When the Jews who were in Moab, Ammon, Edom, and all the surrounding countries heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, as governor over them,

## Jeremiah 40:12
they all returned to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, from all the countries where they had been scattered. And they gathered an abundance of wine and summer fruit.

## Jeremiah 40:13
Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces still in the field came to Gedaliah at Mizpah

## Jeremiah 40:14
and said to him, “Are you aware that Baalis king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah to take your life?” But Gedaliah son of Ahikam did not believe them.

## Jeremiah 40:15
Then Johanan son of Kareah spoke privately to Gedaliah in Mizpah, saying, “Let me go and kill Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and no one will know it. Why should he take your life, causing all the Jews gathered around you to be scattered and the remnant of Judah to perish?”

## Jeremiah 40:16
But Gedaliah son of Ahikam said to Johanan son of Kareah, “Do not do such a thing! What you are saying about Ishmael is not true.”
