# Jeremiah Chapter 10

## Jeremiah 10:1
Listen to the word that the Lord speaks to you, house of Israel.

## Jeremiah 10:2
This is what the Lord says: “Do not adopt the ways of the nations or be alarmed by the signs in the heavens, even though the nations are alarmed by them.

## Jeremiah 10:3
For the customs of the peoples are futile; they cut wood from the forest, a craftsman shapes it with a tool.

## Jeremiah 10:4
They embellish it with silver and gold; they secure it with nails and hammers so it will not topple.

## Jeremiah 10:5
They are like a scarecrow in a cucumber field, unable to speak; they must be carried because they cannot walk. Do not fear them; they can do no harm, nor can they do any good.”

## Jeremiah 10:6
There is none like you, Lord; you are great, and your name is mighty in power.

## Jeremiah 10:7
Who should not revere you, O King of the nations? This is your rightful due. Among all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdoms, there is none like you.

## Jeremiah 10:8
They are altogether senseless and foolish; the instruction from idols is mere wood.

## Jeremiah 10:9
Hammered silver is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of a craftsman and of the hands of a goldsmith. Their clothing is violet and purple, all made by skilled workers.

## Jeremiah 10:10
But the Lord is the true God; he is the living God, the eternal King. The earth trembles at his wrath, and the nations cannot endure his indignation.

## Jeremiah 10:11
This is what you shall say to them: “The gods that did not create the heavens and the earth will perish from the earth and from under these heavens.”

## Jeremiah 10:12
It is he who made the earth by his power, who established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding stretched out the heavens.

## Jeremiah 10:13
When he speaks, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he makes the clouds rise from the ends of the earth. He sends lightning with the rain and brings out the wind from his storehouses.

## Jeremiah 10:14
Every person is senseless, devoid of knowledge; every goldsmith is shamed by his idols, for his images are a fraud, and there is no breath in them.

## Jeremiah 10:15
They are worthless, objects of ridicule; at the time of their punishment, they will perish.

## Jeremiah 10:16
The Portion of Jacob is not like these; for he is the Maker of all things, and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance; the Lord of Hosts is his name.

## Jeremiah 10:17
Collect your possessions, you who dwell under siege.

## Jeremiah 10:18
For this is what the Lord says: “Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time, and I will bring distress upon them so that they may be captured.”

## Jeremiah 10:19
Woe is me because of my injury! My wound is incurable. Yet I said, “This is my affliction, and I must bear it.”

## Jeremiah 10:20
My tent is destroyed, and all its ropes are broken. My children have gone from me and are no more; there is no one to pitch my tent or set up my curtains.

## Jeremiah 10:21
The shepherds are senseless and have not sought the Lord; therefore they do not prosper, and all their flock is scattered.

## Jeremiah 10:22
Listen! A report is coming— a great commotion from the land of the north! It will make the towns of Judah desolate, a haunt of jackals.

## Jeremiah 10:23
I understand, Lord, that a person's path is not within their own control, nor is it for them to determine their steps.

## Jeremiah 10:24
Discipline me, Lord, but with fairness; not in your anger, or I will be diminished.

## Jeremiah 10:25
Pour out your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge you, and on the families that do not call upon your name; for they have devoured Jacob, they have devoured him completely and laid waste his homeland.
