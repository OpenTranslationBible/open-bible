# Jeremiah Chapter 29

## Jeremiah 29:1
These are the words of the letter that the prophet Jeremiah sent from Jerusalem to the remaining elders of the exile, the priests, the prophets, and all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon.

## Jeremiah 29:2
(This happened after King Jeconiah and the queen mother, the court officials, the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the artisans had left Jerusalem.)

## Jeremiah 29:3
The letter was given to Elasah son of Shaphan and Gemariah son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. It stated:

## Jeremiah 29:4
This is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says to all the exiles whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon:

## Jeremiah 29:5
“Build houses and dwell in them; plant gardens and consume their produce.

## Jeremiah 29:6
Take wives and have sons and daughters; find wives for your sons and give your daughters in marriage, so that they too may have sons and daughters. Multiply there and do not diminish.

## Jeremiah 29:7
Seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the Lord on its behalf; for in its welfare you will find your welfare.”

## Jeremiah 29:8
For thus says the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel: “Do not be deceived by the prophets and diviners who are among you, and do not heed the dreams you cause them to dream.

## Jeremiah 29:9
They are prophesying falsely to you in My name. I have not sent them,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 29:10
For thus says the Lord: “When seventy years are completed for Babylon, I will visit you and fulfil My good promise to return you to this place.

## Jeremiah 29:11
For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans for your welfare and not for calamity, to give you a future and a hope.

## Jeremiah 29:12
Then you will call upon Me and come and pray to Me, and I will listen to you.

## Jeremiah 29:13
You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart.

## Jeremiah 29:14
I will let Myself be found by you,” declares the Lord, “and I will restore your fortunes and gather you from all the nations and places where I have driven you,” declares the Lord, “and will bring you back to the place from which I sent you into exile.”

## Jeremiah 29:15
Because you have said, “The Lord has raised up prophets for us in Babylon”—

## Jeremiah 29:16
this is what the Lord says concerning the king who sits on David’s throne and all the people who remain in this city, your fellow citizens who did not go with you into exile—

## Jeremiah 29:17
this is what the Lord of Hosts says: “Behold, I am sending the sword, famine, and plague against them, and I will make them like figs that are so bad they cannot be eaten.

## Jeremiah 29:18
I will pursue them with the sword, famine, and plague, and will make them an object of terror to all the kingdoms of the earth, a curse and a horror, a hissing and a reproach, among all the nations where I have driven them,

## Jeremiah 29:19
because they have not listened to My words,” declares the Lord, “words that I sent to them again and again by My servants the prophets; and you exiles have not listened either,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 29:20
So, listen to the word of the Lord, all you exiles whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon.

## Jeremiah 29:21
This is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says concerning Ahab son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah son of Maaseiah, who are prophesying falsehoods to you in My name: “Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will slay them before your eyes.

## Jeremiah 29:22
Because of them, this curse will be used by all the exiles from Judah in Babylon: ‘May the Lord make you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire,’

## Jeremiah 29:23
for they have committed an outrage in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbours’ wives, and have spoken lies in My name, which I did not command. I am the one who knows and am a witness,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 29:24
Speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,

## Jeremiah 29:25
This is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: “Because you have sent letters in your own name to all the people in Jerusalem, to the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah, and to all the priests, saying,

## Jeremiah 29:26
‘The Lord has made you priest instead of Jehoiada, to be the overseer in the house of the Lord, to put any madman who prophesies into the stocks and neck-irons.

## Jeremiah 29:27
So why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth, who poses as a prophet among you?

## Jeremiah 29:28
For he has sent this message to us in Babylon: “The exile will be long; build houses and dwell in them, and plant gardens and eat their produce.”’”

## Jeremiah 29:29
Zephaniah the priest, however, read this letter to Jeremiah the prophet.

## Jeremiah 29:30
Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying,

## Jeremiah 29:31
“Send this message to all the exiles: ‘This is what the Lord says concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: “Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, though I did not send him, and has led you to trust in lies,”

## Jeremiah 29:32
therefore this is what the Lord says: “Behold, I am going to punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his descendants; he will have no one remaining among this people, nor will he see the good that I will do for My people,” declares the Lord, “because he has preached rebellion against Me.”’”
