# Jeremiah Chapter 20

## Jeremiah 20:1

When Pashhur, the priest, son of Immer, who was the chief overseer in the house of the Lord, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things,

## Jeremiah 20:2

he had Jeremiah the prophet beaten and placed in the stocks at the Upper Gate of Benjamin by the temple of the Lord.

## Jeremiah 20:3

The following day, when Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, “The Lord does not call you Pashhur, but rather Terror on Every Side.

## Jeremiah 20:4

For this is what the Lord says: ‘I will make you a terror to yourself and all your friends; you will witness them fall by the sword of their enemies. I will hand over all Judah to the king of Babylon, who will take them away to Babylon or slay them with the sword.

## Jeremiah 20:5

I will deliver all the wealth of this city, all its produce, and all its valuables, including the treasures of the kings of Judah, into the hands of their enemies, who will plunder them and carry them off to Babylon.

## Jeremiah 20:6

And you, Pashhur, along with all who dwell in your house, will go into exile to Babylon. There you will die and be buried, you and all your friends to whom you have falsely prophesied.’”

## Jeremiah 20:7

Lord, you deceived me, and I was deceived; you overpowered me and prevailed. I have become a laughingstock all day long; everyone mocks me.

## Jeremiah 20:8

Whenever I speak, I cry out, proclaiming violence and destruction. The word of the Lord has brought me insult and reproach all day long.

## Jeremiah 20:9

But if I say, “I will not mention him or speak any more in his name,” his word is like a burning fire in my heart, shut up in my bones. I am weary of holding it in; indeed, I cannot.

## Jeremiah 20:10

I hear many whispering, “Terror on every side! Denounce him! Let us denounce him!” All my trusted friends are watching for me to slip, saying, “Perhaps he will be deceived, and we will prevail over him and take our revenge on him.”

## Jeremiah 20:11

But the Lord is with me like a mighty warrior; therefore my persecutors will stumble and not prevail. They will be put to great shame, their disgrace will never be forgotten.

## Jeremiah 20:12

Lord of hosts, you who test the righteous and see the heart and mind, let me see your vengeance on them, for to you I have committed my cause.

## Jeremiah 20:13

Sing to the Lord, praise the Lord! For he rescues the life of the needy from the hands of the wicked.

## Jeremiah 20:14

Cursed be the day I was born! May the day my mother bore me not be blessed!

## Jeremiah 20:15

Cursed be the man who brought my father the news, who made him very glad, saying, “A son is born to you!”

## Jeremiah 20:16

May that man be like the towns the Lord overthrew without pity. May he hear wailing in the morning, a battle cry at noon.

## Jeremiah 20:17

For he did not kill me in the womb, with my mother as my grave, her womb enlarged forever.

## Jeremiah 20:18

Why did I ever come out of the womb to see trouble and sorrow and to end my days in shame?
