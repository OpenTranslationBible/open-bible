# Jeremiah Chapter 22

## Jeremiah 22:1

This is what the Lord says: “Go down to the residence of the king of Judah and deliver this message there:

## Jeremiah 22:2

‘Listen to the word of the Lord, O king of Judah, you who sit upon David’s throne, along with your servants and your people who enter these gates.

## Jeremiah 22:3

This is what the Lord says: Act with justice and righteousness. Rescue the victim of robbery from the hand of the oppressor. Do no harm or violence to the foreigner, the orphan, or the widow, and do not shed innocent blood in this place.

## Jeremiah 22:4

For if you carefully follow these instructions, then kings who sit on David’s throne will enter through the gates of this house, riding in chariots and on horses, accompanied by their servants and their people.

## Jeremiah 22:5

But if you do not heed these words, declares the Lord, I swear by myself that this house will become a desolation.’”

## Jeremiah 22:6

For this is what the Lord says concerning the house of the king of Judah: “Though you are to me like Gilead, like the summit of Lebanon, I will surely make you a wilderness, cities not inhabited.

## Jeremiah 22:7

I will appoint destroyers against you, each with his weapons, and they will cut down your finest cedars and cast them into the fire.

## Jeremiah 22:8

“Many nations will pass by this city and will say to one another, ‘Why has the Lord done this to such a great city?’

## Jeremiah 22:9

And the answer will be: ‘Because they abandoned the covenant of the Lord their God and worshipped and served other gods.’”

## Jeremiah 22:10

Do not weep for the dead king or mourn his loss; rather, weep bitterly for him who is exiled, for he will never return nor see his native land again.

## Jeremiah 22:11

This is what the Lord declares regarding Shallum son of Josiah, who succeeded his father as king of Judah but has departed: “He will never return.

## Jeremiah 22:12

He will die in the place where they have taken him captive; he will not see this land again.”

## Jeremiah 22:13

“Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness, and his upper rooms by injustice, who makes his neighbour work for nothing, not paying him for his labour.

## Jeremiah 22:14

He says, ‘I will build myself a grand house with spacious upper rooms.’ So he makes large windows in it, panels it with cedar and paints it in bright red.

## Jeremiah 22:15

Does it make you a king to have more cedar? Did not your father have food and drink? He did what was right and just, so all went well with him.

## Jeremiah 22:16

He defended the cause of the poor and needy, and so all went well. Is this not what it means to know me?” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 22:17

“But your eyes and heart are set only on dishonest gain, on shedding innocent blood, and on oppression and extortion.”

## Jeremiah 22:18

Thus says the Lord concerning Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah: “They will not mourn for him: ‘Alas, my brother! Alas, my sister!’ They will not mourn for him: ‘Alas, my master! Alas, his splendour!’

## Jeremiah 22:19

He will have the burial of a donkey—dragged away and thrown outside the gates of Jerusalem.”

## Jeremiah 22:20

“Ascend to Lebanon and cry out, let your voice be heard in Bashan, call out from Abarim, for all your allies are crushed.

## Jeremiah 22:21

I spoke to you in your prosperity, but you said, ‘I will not listen!’ This has been your way from your youth; you have not obeyed my voice.

## Jeremiah 22:22

The wind will drive away all your shepherds, and your allies will go into captivity. Then you will be ashamed and disgraced because of all your wickedness.

## Jeremiah 22:23

You who dwell in Lebanon, nestled in cedar buildings, how you will groan when pangs come upon you, pain like that of a woman in labour!

## Jeremiah 22:24

“As surely as I live,” declares the Lord, “even if Coniah son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were a signet ring on my right hand, I would still pull you off.

## Jeremiah 22:25

I will deliver you into the hands of those who seek your life, those you fear—Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and the Chaldeans.

## Jeremiah 22:26

I will hurl you and the mother who bore you into another country, where neither of you was born, and there you will both die.

## Jeremiah 22:27

You will never return to the land you long to return to.”

## Jeremiah 22:28

Is this man Coniah a despised, shattered pot, an object no one wants? Why will he and his descendants be hurled out, cast into a land they do not know?

## Jeremiah 22:29

O earth, O earth, O earth, hear the word of the Lord!

## Jeremiah 22:30

This is what the Lord says: “Record this man as childless, a man who will not prosper in his lifetime, for none of his offspring will prosper, none will sit on the throne of David or rule anymore in Judah.”
