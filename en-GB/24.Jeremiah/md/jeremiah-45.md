# Jeremiah Chapter 45

## Jeremiah 45:1  
This is the message which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah,  
when he had written these words in a book at Jeremiah’s dictation,  
in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying:

## Jeremiah 45:2  
“This is what the Lord, the God of Israel says to you, Baruch:

## Jeremiah 45:3  
‘You said, “Oh, woe to me! For the Lord has added grief to my pain;  
I am weary with my groaning and have found no rest.”’

## Jeremiah 45:4  
This is what you are to say to him:  
‘This is what the Lord says:  
“Behold, what I have built I am going to tear down,  
And what I have planted I am going to uproot,  
That is, the entire land.”

## Jeremiah 45:5  
But as for you, are you seeking great things for yourself?  
Do not seek them;  
For behold, I am going to bring disaster on all flesh,’ declares the Lord,  
‘But I will give your life to you as plunder in all the places where you may go.’”
