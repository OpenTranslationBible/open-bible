# Jeremiah Chapter 45

## Jeremiah 45:1

This is the message that Jeremiah the prophet delivered to Baruch son of Neriah, when he had inscribed these words in a scroll at Jeremiah’s dictation, during the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah:

## Jeremiah 45:2

“The Lord, the God of Israel, speaks this message to you, Baruch:

## Jeremiah 45:3

‘You have said, “Woe is me! The Lord has added sorrow to my pain; I am exhausted from groaning and find no rest.”’

## Jeremiah 45:4

This is what you are to say to him: ‘This is what the Lord says: “See, what I have built I will demolish, and what I have planted I will uproot, concerning the whole land.”

## Jeremiah 45:5

But you, are you seeking great things for yourself? Do not seek them; for I am going to bring calamity upon all people,’ declares the Lord, ‘but wherever you go, I will grant you your life as a prize.’”
