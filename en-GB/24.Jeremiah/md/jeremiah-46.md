# Jeremiah Chapter 46

## Jeremiah 46:1  
That which came as the word of the Lord to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations.

## Jeremiah 46:2  
To Egypt, concerning the army of Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt, which was by the Euphrates River at Carchemish,  
which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon defeated in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah:

## Jeremiah 46:3  
“Line up the shield and buckler,  
And advance to battle!

## Jeremiah 46:4  
Harness the horses,  
And mount the steeds!  
Take your positions with helmets on!  
Polish the spears,  
Put on the coats of armor!”

## Jeremiah 46:5  
“Why have I seen it?  
They are terrified,  
They are retreating,  
And their warriors are crushed  
And flee in haste without looking back;  
Terror is on every side!”  
Declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 46:6  
Let not the swift man flee,  
Nor the warrior escape!  
In the north by the river Euphrates  
They have stumbled and fallen.

## Jeremiah 46:7  
Who is this that rises like the Nile,  
Like the rivers whose waters surge?

## Jeremiah 46:8  
Egypt rises like the Nile,  
And like the rivers whose waters surge;  
And he has said, “I will rise and cover that land;  
I will destroy the city and its inhabitants.”

## Jeremiah 46:9  
Go up, you horses, and drive wildly, you chariots,  
So that the warriors may go out:  
Cush and Put, who handle the shield,  
And the Lydians, who handle and bend the bow.

## Jeremiah 46:10  
For that day belongs to the Lord God of armies,  
A day of vengeance, so as to avenge Himself on His foes;  
And the sword will devour and be satisfied,  
And drink its fill of their blood;  
For there will be a slaughter for the Lord God of armies,  
In the land of the north by the river Euphrates.

## Jeremiah 46:11  
Go up to Gilead and obtain balm,  
O virgin daughter of Egypt!  
In vain you have multiplied remedies;  
There is no healing for you.

## Jeremiah 46:12  
The nations have heard of your disgrace,  
And your outcry has filled the earth.  
Because one warrior has stumbled over another,  
And both of them have fallen down together.

## Jeremiah 46:13  
This is the message which the Lord spoke to Jeremiah the prophet about the coming of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to strike the land of Egypt:

## Jeremiah 46:14  
“Declare in Egypt and proclaim in Migdol,  
Proclaim also in Memphis and Tahpanhes;  
Say, ‘Take your stand and get yourself ready,  
For the sword has devoured those around you.’

## Jeremiah 46:15  
Why have your powerful ones been cut down?  
They do not stand because the Lord has thrust them away.

## Jeremiah 46:16  
They have repeatedly stumbled;  
Indeed, they have fallen, each one against another.  
Then they said, ‘Get up, and let’s go back  
To our own people and our native land,  
Away from the sword of the oppressor!’

## Jeremiah 46:17  
They shouted there, ‘Pharaoh king of Egypt is nothing but a big noise;  
He has let the appointed time pass by!’

## Jeremiah 46:18  
As I live,” declares the King,  
Whose name is the Lord of armies,  
“One certainly shall come who is like Tabor among the mountains,  
Or like Carmel by the sea.

## Jeremiah 46:19  
Make your baggage ready for exile,  
Daughter living in Egypt,  
For Memphis will become a desolation;  
It will be destroyed and uninhabited.

## Jeremiah 46:20  
Egypt is a pretty heifer,  
But a horsefly is coming from the north—it is coming!

## Jeremiah 46:21  
Also her mercenaries in her midst  
Are like fattened calves,  
For they too have turned back and have fled together;  
They did not stand their ground.  
For the day of their disaster has come upon them,  
The time of their punishment.

## Jeremiah 46:22  
Its sound moves along like a serpent;  
For they move on like an army  
And come to her with axes, like woodcutters.

## Jeremiah 46:23  
They have cut down her forest,” declares the Lord;  
“Certainly it will no longer be found,  
Even though they are more numerous than locusts  
And are without number.

## Jeremiah 46:24  
The daughter of Egypt has been put to shame,  
Turned over to the power of the people of the north.”

## Jeremiah 46:25  
The Lord of armies, the God of Israel says:  
“Behold, I am going to punish Amon of Thebes, Pharaoh, Egypt along with her gods and her kings,  
Indeed, Pharaoh and those who trust in him.

## Jeremiah 46:26  
I shall hand them over to those who are seeking their lives,  
To Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and to his servants.  
Afterward, however, it will be inhabited as in the days of old,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 46:27  
“But as for you, Jacob My servant, do not fear,  
Nor be dismayed, Israel!  
For, see, I am going to save you from far away,  
And your descendants from the land of their captivity;  
And Jacob will return and be undisturbed  
And secure, with no one making him afraid.

## Jeremiah 46:28  
Jacob My servant, do not fear,” declares the Lord,  
“For I am with you.  
For I will make a complete destruction of all the nations  
Where I have driven you,  
Yet I will not make a complete destruction of you;  
But I will discipline you properly  
And by no means leave you unpunished.”
