# Jeremiah Chapter 33

## Jeremiah 33:1  
Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the second time, while he was still confined in the courtyard of the guard, saying,

## Jeremiah 33:2  
“This is what the Lord says, He who made the earth, the Lord who formed it to establish it, the Lord is His name:

## Jeremiah 33:3  
‘Call to Me and I will answer you, and I will tell you great and mighty things, which you do not know.’

## Jeremiah 33:4  
For this is what the Lord, the God of Israel says concerning the houses of this city, and the houses of the kings of Judah which are torn down to make a defense against the assault ramps and the sword:

## Jeremiah 33:5  
‘While they are coming to fight the Chaldeans and to fill them with the dead bodies of people whom I have struck down in My anger and My wrath,  
and I have hidden My face from this city because of all their wickedness:

## Jeremiah 33:6  
Behold, I am going to bring to it health and healing, and I will heal them; and I will reveal to them an abundance of peace and truth.

## Jeremiah 33:7  
I will restore the fortunes of Judah and the fortunes of Israel, and will rebuild them as they were at first.

## Jeremiah 33:8  
And I will cleanse them from all their guilt of sin against Me, and I will forgive all their sins of rebellion against Me.

## Jeremiah 33:9  
It will be to Me a name of joy, praise, and glory before all the nations of the earth, which will hear of all the good that I do for them,  
and they will be afraid and tremble because of all the good and all the peace that I make for it.’

## Jeremiah 33:10  
“This is what the Lord says:  
‘Yet again there will be heard in this place, of which you say, “It is a waste, without man and without animal,”  
that is, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate, without man, without inhabitant, and without animal,

## Jeremiah 33:11  
the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the groom and the voice of the bride,  
the voice of those who say, “Give thanks to the Lord of armies, for the Lord is good, for His mercy is everlasting”—  
and of those who bring a thank offering into the house of the Lord.  
For I will restore the fortunes of the land as they were at first,’ says the Lord.

## Jeremiah 33:12  
“This is what the Lord of armies says:  
‘There will again be in this place, which is waste, without man or animal, and in all its cities,  
a resting place for shepherds who rest their flocks.

## Jeremiah 33:13  
In the cities of the hill country, in the cities of the lowland, in the cities of the Negev,  
in the land of Benjamin, in the areas around Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah,  
the flocks will again pass under the hands of the one who counts them,’ says the Lord.

## Jeremiah 33:14  
‘Behold, days are coming,’ declares the Lord,  
‘when I will fulfill the good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and the house of Judah.

## Jeremiah 33:15  
In those days and at that time I will make a righteous Branch of David sprout;  
and He shall execute justice and righteousness on the earth.

## Jeremiah 33:16  
In those days Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will live in safety;  
and this is the name by which she will be called: “The Lord is our righteousness.”

## Jeremiah 33:17  
For this is what the Lord says: ‘David shall not lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel;

## Jeremiah 33:18  
and the Levitical priests shall not lack a man before Me to offer burnt offerings,  
to burn grain offerings, and to prepare sacrifices continually.’”

## Jeremiah 33:19  
And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying,

## Jeremiah 33:20  
“This is what the Lord says: ‘If you can break My covenant for the day and My covenant for the night,  
so that day and night do not occur at their appointed time,

## Jeremiah 33:21  
then My covenant with My servant David may also be broken,  
so that he will not have a son to reign on his throne,  
and My covenant with the Levitical priests, My ministers.

## Jeremiah 33:22  
As the heavenly lights cannot be counted and the sand of the sea cannot be measured,  
so I will multiply the descendants of My servant David and the Levites who minister to Me.’”

## Jeremiah 33:23  
And the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying,

## Jeremiah 33:24  
“Do you not see what this people are saying,  
‘The two families that the Lord chose, He has rejected them’?  
So they despise My people, as if they were no longer a nation in their sight.

## Jeremiah 33:25  
This is what the Lord says:  
‘If My covenant for day and night does not stand,  
And if I have not established the fixed patterns of heaven and earth,

## Jeremiah 33:26  
then I would also reject the descendants of Jacob and David My servant,  
So as not to take from his descendants rulers over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  
But I will restore their fortunes and have mercy on them.’”
