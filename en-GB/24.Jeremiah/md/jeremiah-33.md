# Jeremiah Chapter 33

## Jeremiah 33:1
The message from the Lord came to Jeremiah a second time while he was still confined in the courtyard of the guard, saying,

## Jeremiah 33:2
“This is what the Lord says, He who made the earth, the Lord who formed it and established it—His name is the Lord:

## Jeremiah 33:3
‘Call to Me and I will answer you, and I will show you great and unsearchable things you do not know.’

## Jeremiah 33:4
For this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says concerning the houses of this city and the royal palaces of Judah that have been torn down to defend against the siege ramps and the sword:

## Jeremiah 33:5
‘While they come to fight the Babylonians, they will fill the houses with the bodies of those I have slain in My anger and wrath. I have hidden My face from this city because of all its wickedness.

## Jeremiah 33:6
Nevertheless, I will bring health and healing to it; I will heal My people and will reveal to them an abundance of peace and truth.

## Jeremiah 33:7
I will restore the fortunes of Judah and Israel and rebuild them as they were at first.

## Jeremiah 33:8
I will cleanse them from all the sins they have committed against Me and will forgive all their sins of rebellion against Me.

## Jeremiah 33:9
Then this city will bring Me joy, praise, and honour before all nations on earth that hear of all the good I do for it; and they will be in awe and tremble at the abundant prosperity and peace I provide for it.’

## Jeremiah 33:10
“This is what the Lord says: ‘In this place, of which you say, “It is a desolate waste, without people or animals,” in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem that are deserted, without people or animals, there will again be heard

## Jeremiah 33:11
the sounds of joy and gladness, the voices of the bride and bridegroom, and the voices of those who bring thank offerings to the house of the Lord, saying, “Give thanks to the Lord Almighty, for the Lord is good; His love endures forever.” For I will restore the fortunes of the land as they were before,’ says the Lord.

## Jeremiah 33:12
“This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘In this place, which is desolate and without people or animals, in all its towns there will again be pastures for shepherds to rest their flocks.

## Jeremiah 33:13
In the towns of the hill country, the western foothills, and the Negev, in the territory of Benjamin, in the villages around Jerusalem and in the towns of Judah, flocks will once more pass under the care of the one who counts them,’ says the Lord.

## Jeremiah 33:14
‘The time is coming,’ declares the Lord, ‘when I will fulfill the good promise I made to the people of Israel and Judah.

## Jeremiah 33:15
During those days and at that time, I will cause a righteous Branch to emerge from David’s line; He will execute justice and righteousness in the land.

## Jeremiah 33:16
In those days Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will live in safety. This is the name by which it will be called: The Lord Our Righteousness.’

## Jeremiah 33:17
For this is what the Lord says: ‘David will never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel,

## Jeremiah 33:18
nor will the Levitical priests ever lack a man to stand before Me to offer burnt offerings, to burn grain offerings, and to present sacrifices continually.’”

## Jeremiah 33:19
The Lord's message came to Jeremiah, saying,

## Jeremiah 33:20
“This is what the Lord says: ‘If you can break My covenant with the day and My covenant with the night, so that day and night do not occur at their appointed times,

## Jeremiah 33:21
then My covenant with David My servant—and My covenant with the Levites who are priests ministering before Me—can be broken, so that David will no longer have a descendant to reign on his throne.

## Jeremiah 33:22
I will make the descendants of David My servant and the Levites who minister before Me as numerous as the stars in the sky and as immeasurable as the sand on the seashore.’”

## Jeremiah 33:23
The word from the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying,

## Jeremiah 33:24
“Have you not noticed what these people are saying, ‘The Lord has rejected the two families He chose’? So they despise My people and no longer regard them as a nation.

## Jeremiah 33:25
This is what the Lord says: ‘If I have not set My covenant with day and night and established the laws of heaven and earth,

## Jeremiah 33:26
then I will disregard the descendants of Jacob and David My servant and will not choose one of his sons to rule over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For I will restore their fortunes and have compassion on them.’”
