# Jeremiah Chapter 52

## Jeremiah 52:1
Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem for eleven years. His mother’s name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah.

## Jeremiah 52:2
He did evil in the sight of the Lord, similar to all that Jehoiakim had done.

## Jeremiah 52:3
Due to the Lord’s anger, this occurred to Jerusalem and Judah, until He cast them out from His presence. And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.

## Jeremiah 52:4
In the ninth year of Zedekiah’s reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came with his entire army against Jerusalem. They encamped against it and built siege works all around.

## Jeremiah 52:5
The city was besieged until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.

## Jeremiah 52:6
By the ninth day of the fourth month, the famine in the city was so severe that there was no food for the people of the land.

## Jeremiah 52:7
Then the city wall was breached, and all the warriors fled. They left the city by night through the gate between the two walls near the king’s garden, even though the Chaldeans surrounded the city. They fled towards the Arabah.

## Jeremiah 52:8
But the Chaldean army pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho, and all his soldiers were scattered from him.

## Jeremiah 52:9
They captured the king and took him to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he pronounced judgement upon him.

## Jeremiah 52:10
The king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and he also killed all the officials of Judah at Riblah.

## Jeremiah 52:11
Then he blinded Zedekiah’s eyes, bound him with bronze shackles, and took him to Babylon, where he remained in prison until the day of his death.

## Jeremiah 52:12
On the tenth day of the fifth month, in the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard who served the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.

## Jeremiah 52:13
He set fire to the house of the Lord, the royal palace, and all the houses of Jerusalem. Every large house he burned down.

## Jeremiah 52:14
The entire Chaldean army, under the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls surrounding Jerusalem.

## Jeremiah 52:15
Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, carried into exile some of the poorest people, those remaining in the city, the deserters who had gone over to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the craftsmen.

## Jeremiah 52:16
But Nebuzaradan left behind some of the poorest people of the land to be vinedressers and farmers.

## Jeremiah 52:17
The Chaldeans broke up the bronze pillars, the stands, and the bronze sea that were in the house of the Lord, and they carried all the bronze to Babylon.

## Jeremiah 52:18
They also took away the pots, shovels, snuffers, basins, pans, and all the bronze vessels used in temple service.

## Jeremiah 52:19
The captain of the guard took the bowls, firepans, basins, pots, lampstands, pans, and drink offering bowls—whatever was made of fine gold or silver.

## Jeremiah 52:20
The bronze from the two pillars, the sea, the twelve bronze bulls under it, and the stands, which King Solomon had made for the house of the Lord, was beyond measure.

## Jeremiah 52:21
Each pillar was eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits around; each was four fingers thick and hollow.

## Jeremiah 52:22
A bronze capital was on top of each pillar; each capital was five cubits high, with latticework and pomegranates of bronze all around. The second pillar was similar, with pomegranates.

## Jeremiah 52:23
There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; in total, there were a hundred pomegranates above the surrounding latticework.

## Jeremiah 52:24
The captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the second priest, along with the three doorkeepers.

## Jeremiah 52:25
He also took from the city an officer in charge of the warriors, seven royal advisers, the scribe of the commander of the army who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men found in the city.

## Jeremiah 52:26
Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.

## Jeremiah 52:27
The king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah went into exile from its land.

## Jeremiah 52:28
This is the number of people Nebuchadnezzar carried into exile: in the seventh year, 3,023 Jews;

## Jeremiah 52:29
in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, 832 individuals from Jerusalem;

## Jeremiah 52:30
in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took into exile 745 Jewish people; the total was 4,600 people.

## Jeremiah 52:31
In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth day of the month, Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, showed favour to Jehoiachin king of Judah and released him from prison.

## Jeremiah 52:32
He treated him with kindness and set his throne above the thrones of the other kings who were with him in Babylon.

## Jeremiah 52:33
So Jehoiachin changed his prison clothes and dined regularly in the presence of the king for the rest of his life.

## Jeremiah 52:34
Day by day, a regular allowance was given to him by the king of Babylon, a portion for each day, until the day of his death.
