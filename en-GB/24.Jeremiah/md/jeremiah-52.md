# Jeremiah Chapter 52

## Jeremiah 52:1  
Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem.  
And his mother’s name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.

## Jeremiah 52:2  
He did evil in the sight of the Lord, like everything that Jehoiakim had done.

## Jeremiah 52:3  
Because of the anger of the Lord this came about in Jerusalem and Judah, until He drove them out from His presence.  
And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.

## Jeremiah 52:4  
Now it came about in the ninth year of his reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month,  
that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, camped against it,  
and built a siege wall all around it.

## Jeremiah 52:5  
So the city was under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.

## Jeremiah 52:6  
On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land.

## Jeremiah 52:7  
Then the city was breached, and all the men of war fled and left the city at night by way of the gate between the two walls,  
which was by the king’s garden, though the Chaldeans were all around the city;  
and they went by way of the Arabah.

## Jeremiah 52:8  
But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho,  
and all his army was scattered from him.

## Jeremiah 52:9  
Then they captured the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath,  
and he passed sentence on him.

## Jeremiah 52:10  
And the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes,  
and he also slaughtered all the leaders of Judah in Riblah.

## Jeremiah 52:11  
Then he blinded the eyes of Zedekiah;  
and the king of Babylon bound him in bronze shackles and brought him to Babylon,  
and put him in prison until the day of his death.

## Jeremiah 52:12  
Now on the tenth day of the fifth month, which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon,  
Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, who was in the service of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.

## Jeremiah 52:13  
And he burned the house of the Lord, the king’s house, and all the houses of Jerusalem;  
even every large house he burned with fire.

## Jeremiah 52:14  
So all the army of the Chaldeans who were with the captain of the guard tore down all the walls around Jerusalem.

## Jeremiah 52:15  
Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard led into exile some of the poorest of the people,  
the rest of the people who were left in the city,  
the deserters who had deserted to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the craftsmen.

## Jeremiah 52:16  
But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and farmers.

## Jeremiah 52:17  
Now the Chaldeans broke into pieces the bronze pillars that were in the house of the Lord,  
and the stands and the bronze sea that were in the house of the Lord,  
and carried all their bronze to Babylon.

## Jeremiah 52:18  
They also took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the bowls, the spoons, and all the bronze utensils  
which were used in temple service.

## Jeremiah 52:19  
The captain of the guard also took away the basins, the firepans, the bowls, the pots, the lampstands, the spoons, and the cups,  
what was fine gold and what was fine silver.

## Jeremiah 52:20  
The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve bronze bulls under the sea, which King Solomon had made for the house of the Lord—  
the bronze of all these vessels was beyond weight.

## Jeremiah 52:21  
As for the pillars, the height of each pillar was eighteen cubits, and it was twelve cubits in circumference and four fingers thick, and hollow.

## Jeremiah 52:22  
Now a bronze capital was on it; and the height of each capital was five cubits,  
with latticework and pomegranates on the capital all around, all made of bronze.  
And the second pillar was like these, also with pomegranates.

## Jeremiah 52:23  
There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates were a hundred on the network all around.

## Jeremiah 52:24  
Then the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest,  
Zephaniah the second priest, and the three doorkeepers.

## Jeremiah 52:25  
He also took from the city one official who was overseer of the warriors,  
seven men from among the king’s advisers who were found in the city,  
the scribe of the commander of the army who mustered the people of the land,  
and sixty men from the people of the land who were found in the midst of the city.

## Jeremiah 52:26  
Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.

## Jeremiah 52:27  
Then the king of Babylon struck them and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath.  
So Judah was led into exile from its land.

## Jeremiah 52:28  
These are the people whom Nebuchadnezzar took into exile:  
in the seventh year, 3,023 Jews;

## Jeremiah 52:29  
in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, 832 people from Jerusalem;

## Jeremiah 52:30  
in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar,  
Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took 745 Jews into exile.  
There were 4,600 people in total.

## Jeremiah 52:31  
Now it came about in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah,  
in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth of the month,  
that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign,  
showed favor to Jehoiachin king of Judah and brought him out of prison.

## Jeremiah 52:32  
Then he spoke kindly to him and set his throne above the thrones of the kings who were with him in Babylon.

## Jeremiah 52:33  
So Jehoiachin changed his prison clothes, and had his meals in the king’s presence regularly all the days of his life.

## Jeremiah 52:34  
And for his allowance, a regular allowance was given him by the king of Babylon,  
a daily portion all the days of his life until the day of his death.
