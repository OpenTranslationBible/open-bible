# Jeremiah Chapter 16

## Jeremiah 16:1
The word of the Lord came to me, saying,

## Jeremiah 16:2
“You shall not marry or have sons or daughters in this place.”

## Jeremiah 16:3
For thus says the Lord concerning the sons and daughters born in this land, and concerning their mothers who bear them and their fathers who beget them in this land:

## Jeremiah 16:4
“They shall die of grievous diseases; they shall not be lamented or buried; they shall be as dung on the surface of the ground. They shall perish by the sword and by famine, and their corpses shall be food for the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth.”

## Jeremiah 16:5
For thus says the Lord: “Do not enter the house of mourning, nor go to lament or console them, for I have withdrawn my peace, my lovingkindness, and my compassion from this people,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 16:6
“Both the great and the small shall die in this land; they shall not be buried, nor shall anyone lament for them, nor make cuts on themselves or shave their heads for them.

## Jeremiah 16:7
No one shall break bread in mourning for them, to comfort anyone for the dead, nor shall anyone give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or mother.

## Jeremiah 16:8
“And do not enter the house of feasting, to sit with them to eat and drink.”

## Jeremiah 16:9
For thus says the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel: “Behold, I will cause to cease from this place, before your eyes and in your days, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.

## Jeremiah 16:10
“And it shall come to pass, when you tell this people all these words, and they say to you, ‘Why has the Lord pronounced all this great disaster against us? What is our iniquity? What is our sin that we have committed against the Lord our God?’

## Jeremiah 16:11
then you shall say to them, ‘Because your ancestors have forsaken me,’ declares the Lord, ‘and have followed other gods and served and worshipped them, and have forsaken me and have not kept my law.

## Jeremiah 16:12
And you have done worse than your ancestors, for behold, each one of you follows the stubbornness of his evil heart, without listening to me.

## Jeremiah 16:13
Therefore, I will cast you out of this land into a land that neither you nor your ancestors have known, and there you shall serve other gods day and night, for I will show you no favour.’

## Jeremiah 16:14
“Therefore, behold, the days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when it shall no longer be said, ‘As the Lord lives, who brought the children of Israel up out of the land of Egypt,’

## Jeremiah 16:15
but, ‘As the Lord lives, who brought the children of Israel from the land of the north and from all the lands where he had driven them.’ For I will bring them back to their own land which I gave to their ancestors.

## Jeremiah 16:16
“Behold, I am sending for many fishermen,” declares the Lord, “and they shall catch them; and afterward I will send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain and every hill, and from the clefts of the rocks.

## Jeremiah 16:17
For my eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from my face, nor is their iniquity concealed from my eyes.

## Jeremiah 16:18
I will repay them double for their iniquity and their sin, because they have defiled my land with the lifeless forms of their detestable idols, and have filled my inheritance with their abominations.”

## Jeremiah 16:19
O Lord, my strength and my fortress, my refuge in the day of trouble, to you the nations shall come from the ends of the earth and say, “Surely our ancestors have inherited lies, worthless idols that are of no benefit.”

## Jeremiah 16:20
Can a person make gods for themselves? But they are not gods!

## Jeremiah 16:21
“Therefore, behold, I will make them know—this time I will make them know my power and my might; and they shall know that my name is the Lord.”
