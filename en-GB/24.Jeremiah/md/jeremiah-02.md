# Jeremiah Chapter 2

## Jeremiah 2:1
The word of the Lord came to me, saying:

## Jeremiah 2:2
“Go and proclaim in the ears of Jerusalem: ‘This is what the Lord says: “I remember the devotion of your youth, your love as a bride, how you followed me through the wilderness, through a land not sown.

## Jeremiah 2:3
Israel was holy to the Lord, the firstfruits of his harvest. All who devoured her were held guilty; disaster came upon them,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 2:4
Hear the word of the Lord, you descendants of Jacob, all the families of the house of Israel.

## Jeremiah 2:5
This is what the Lord says: “What fault did your ancestors find in me, that they strayed so far from me? They followed worthless idols and became worthless themselves.

## Jeremiah 2:6
They did not say, ‘Where is the Lord who brought us up out of Egypt, who led us through the barren wilderness, through a land of deserts and pits, a land of drought and deep darkness, a land where no one travels and no one lives?’

## Jeremiah 2:7
I brought you into a fertile land to eat its fruit and good things. But you came and defiled my land and made my inheritance detestable.

## Jeremiah 2:8
The priests did not say, ‘Where is the Lord?’ Those who handle the law did not know me; the rulers rebelled against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, following things that are of no benefit.

## Jeremiah 2:9
“Therefore I bring charges against you again,” declares the Lord. “And I will contend with your children’s children.

## Jeremiah 2:10
Cross over to the coastlands of Kittim and see, send to Kedar and observe closely; see if there has ever been anything like this:

## Jeremiah 2:11
Has a nation ever changed its gods, even though they are not gods at all? But my people have exchanged their glorious God for that which is worthless.

## Jeremiah 2:12
Be appalled at this, you heavens, and shudder with great horror,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 2:13
“For my people have committed two sins: They have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and have dug their own cisterns, broken cisterns that cannot hold water.

## Jeremiah 2:14
Is Israel a servant, a slave by birth? Why then has he become plunder?

## Jeremiah 2:15
Lions have roared at him, they have roared loudly. They have laid waste his land; his towns are burned and deserted.

## Jeremiah 2:16
Also, the men of Memphis and Tahpanhes have cracked your skull.

## Jeremiah 2:17
Have you not brought this on yourselves by forsaking the Lord your God when he led you in the way?

## Jeremiah 2:18
Now why go to Egypt to drink the waters of the Nile? And why go to Assyria to drink the waters of the Euphrates?

## Jeremiah 2:19
Your wickedness will correct you, and your backsliding will rebuke you. Consider then and realise how evil and bitter it is for you to forsake the Lord your God and have no awe of me,” declares the Lord, the God of armies.

## Jeremiah 2:20
“Long ago you broke off your yoke and tore off your bonds; you said, ‘I will not serve you!’ Indeed, on every high hill and under every spreading tree you lay down as a prostitute.

## Jeremiah 2:21
I had planted you like a choice vine, a completely faithful seed. How then did you turn against me into a corrupt, wild vine?

## Jeremiah 2:22
Although you wash yourself with lye and use much soap, the stain of your guilt is still before me,” declares the Sovereign Lord.

## Jeremiah 2:23
“How can you say, ‘I am not defiled; I have not run after the Baals’? See your behaviour in the valley; consider what you have done. You are a swift she-camel running here and there,

## Jeremiah 2:24
a wild donkey accustomed to the desert, sniffing the wind in her craving— in her heat who can restrain her? Any males that pursue her need not tire themselves; at her time they will find her.

## Jeremiah 2:25
Do not run until your feet are bare and your throat is dry. But you said, ‘It is hopeless! I love foreign gods, and I must go after them.’

## Jeremiah 2:26
“As a thief is disgraced when he is caught, so the house of Israel is disgraced— they, their kings, their officials, their priests, and their prophets.

## Jeremiah 2:27
They say to wood, ‘You are my father,’ and to stone, ‘You gave me birth.’ They have turned their backs to me and not their faces; yet when they are in trouble, they say, ‘Come and save us!’

## Jeremiah 2:28
Where then are the gods you made for yourselves? Let them arise if they can save you in your time of trouble! For you, Judah, have as many gods as you have towns.

## Jeremiah 2:29
“Why do you bring charges against me? You have all rebelled against me,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 2:30
“In vain I punished your people; they did not respond to correction. Your sword has devoured your prophets like a ravenous lion.

## Jeremiah 2:31
“You generation, consider the word of the Lord: Have I been a desert to Israel or a land of thick darkness? Why do my people say, ‘We are free to roam; we will come to you no more’?

## Jeremiah 2:32
Does a young woman forget her jewellery, a bride her wedding ornaments? Yet my people have forgotten me, days without number.

## Jeremiah 2:33
How skilled you are at pursuing love! Even the worst of women can learn from your ways.

## Jeremiah 2:34
On your clothes is found the lifeblood of the innocent poor, though you did not catch them breaking in. Yet in spite of all this

## Jeremiah 2:35
you say, ‘I am innocent; surely his anger is turned away from me.’ But I will pass judgment on you because you say, ‘I have not sinned.’

## Jeremiah 2:36
Why do you go about so much, changing your ways? You will be disappointed by Egypt as you were by Assyria.

## Jeremiah 2:37
You will also leave that place with your hands on your head, for the Lord has rejected those you trust; you will not prosper with them.
