# Jeremiah Chapter 32

## Jeremiah 32:1
The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.

## Jeremiah 32:2
At that time, the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was confined in the courtyard of the guard at the royal palace of Judah.

## Jeremiah 32:3
Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him, saying, “Why do you prophesy, saying, ‘This is what the Lord says: Behold, I am about to give this city into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it;

## Jeremiah 32:4
and Zedekiah king of Judah will not escape from the Babylonians but will certainly be handed over to the king of Babylon, and will speak with him face to face and see him eye to eye.

## Jeremiah 32:5
He will lead Zedekiah to Babylon, where he will stay until I attend to him, declares the Lord. If you fight against the Babylonians, you will not succeed.’”

## Jeremiah 32:6
Jeremiah said, “The message from the Lord came to me, saying,

## Jeremiah 32:7
‘Behold, Hanamel son of Shallum your uncle is going to come to you and say, “Buy my field at Anathoth, because as nearest relative it is your right of redemption to buy it.”’

## Jeremiah 32:8
Then, just as the Lord had said, my cousin Hanamel came to me in the courtyard of the guard and said, ‘Please buy my field at Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin. Since it is your right to redeem it and possess it, buy it for yourself.’ Then I knew that this was the word of the Lord.

## Jeremiah 32:9
So I purchased the field at Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel and weighed out for him seventeen shekels of silver.

## Jeremiah 32:10
I signed and sealed the deed, had it witnessed, and weighed the silver on the scales.

## Jeremiah 32:11
I took the deed of purchase—the sealed copy containing the terms and conditions, as well as the open copy—

## Jeremiah 32:12
and I gave this deed to Baruch son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of my cousin Hanamel and of the witnesses who had signed the deed, as well as all the Jews sitting in the courtyard of the guard.

## Jeremiah 32:13
In their presence, I instructed Baruch, saying,

## Jeremiah 32:14
‘This is what the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, says: Take these documents, both the sealed and open copies of the deed of purchase, and put them in a clay jar so they will last a long time.

## Jeremiah 32:15
For this is what the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, says: Houses, fields, and vineyards will once more be acquired in this land.’

## Jeremiah 32:16
Once I had handed the deed of purchase to Baruch son of Neriah, I prayed to the Lord, saying,

## Jeremiah 32:17
‘Ah, Sovereign Lord, You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and outstretched arm. Nothing is too difficult for You,

## Jeremiah 32:18
who shows love to thousands but repays the wrongdoing of fathers into the laps of their children after them. Great and mighty God, whose name is the Lord of hosts,

## Jeremiah 32:19
great in counsel and mighty in deed, whose eyes are open to all the ways of mankind; You reward each person according to their conduct and as their deeds deserve.

## Jeremiah 32:20
You performed signs and wonders in Egypt and have continued them to this day, in Israel and among all mankind, and have gained the renown that remains Yours.

## Jeremiah 32:21
You delivered Your people Israel from Egypt with miraculous signs and wonders, by Your powerful hand and outstretched arm, and with awe-inspiring acts.

## Jeremiah 32:22
You gave them this land You had promised to their ancestors, a land rich and abundant.

## Jeremiah 32:23
They came in and took possession of it, but they did not obey Your voice or follow Your law; they did not do what You commanded them to do. So You brought all this disaster upon them.

## Jeremiah 32:24
See how the siege ramps are built up to take the city. Because of the sword, famine, and plague, the city will be given into the hands of the Babylonians who are attacking it. What You have spoken has come to pass, as You now see.

## Jeremiah 32:25
Yet You have said to me, Sovereign Lord, ‘Buy the field with silver and have the transaction witnessed,’ although the city has been handed over to the Babylonians.”

## Jeremiah 32:26
Afterwards, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying,

## Jeremiah 32:27
“I am the Lord, the God of all mankind. Is anything too difficult for Me?

## Jeremiah 32:28
Therefore this is what the Lord says: Behold, I am about to give this city into the hands of the Babylonians and to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who will capture it.

## Jeremiah 32:29
The Babylonians who are fighting against this city will come in and set it on fire; they will burn it down, along with the houses where the people have aroused My anger by burning incense on the roofs to Baal and by pouring out drink offerings to other gods.

## Jeremiah 32:30
The people of Israel and Judah have done nothing but evil in My sight from their youth; indeed, the people of Israel have done nothing but provoke Me to anger with the work of their hands, declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 32:31
From the day it was built until now, this city has so provoked My anger and wrath that I must remove it from My sight.

## Jeremiah 32:32
The people of Israel and Judah have stirred My anger by all the evil they have done—they, their kings and officials, their priests and prophets, the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem.

## Jeremiah 32:33
They have turned their backs to Me and not their faces; though I taught them again and again, they would not listen or respond to discipline.

## Jeremiah 32:34
They set up their detestable images in the house that bears My Name and defiled it.

## Jeremiah 32:35
They constructed high places for Baal in the Valley of Ben Hinnom to offer their sons and daughters to Molek, though I never commanded—nor did it enter My mind—that they should commit such an abomination and thus lead Judah into sin.

## Jeremiah 32:36
Now therefore, this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says concerning this city of which you say, ‘It has been handed over to the king of Babylon by sword, famine, and plague’:

## Jeremiah 32:37
Behold, I will surely gather them from all the lands where I have driven them in My furious anger and great wrath; I will bring them back to this place and let them live in safety.

## Jeremiah 32:38
They will be My people, and I will be their God.

## Jeremiah 32:39
I will give them one heart and one way, so that they will always fear Me, for their own good and for the good of their children after them.

## Jeremiah 32:40
I will establish an everlasting covenant with them: I will never cease doing good to them, and I will inspire them to fear Me, so that they will never turn away from Me.

## Jeremiah 32:41
I will take joy in doing them good and will assuredly plant them in this land with all My heart and soul.

## Jeremiah 32:42
For this is what the Lord says: Just as I have brought all this great calamity on this people, so I will give them all the prosperity I have promised them.

## Jeremiah 32:43
Fields will once more be bought in this land of which you say, ‘It is a desolate waste, without people or animals, for it has been given into the hands of the Babylonians.’

## Jeremiah 32:44
Fields will be bought for silver, and deeds will be signed, sealed, and witnessed in the territory of Benjamin, in the areas surrounding Jerusalem, in the towns of Judah, in the towns of the hill country, in the towns of the western foothills, and in the towns of the Negev, because I will restore their fortunes, declares the Lord.”
