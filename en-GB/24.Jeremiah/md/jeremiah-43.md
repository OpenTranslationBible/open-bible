# Jeremiah Chapter 43

## Jeremiah 43:1
When Jeremiah, whom the Lord their God had sent, had finished conveying all the words of the Lord their God to the people—all these words—

## Jeremiah 43:2
Azariah son of Hoshaiah, Johanan son of Kareah, and all the arrogant men said to Jeremiah, “You are lying! The Lord our God has not sent you to tell us, ‘You must not go to Egypt to reside there.’

## Jeremiah 43:3
But Baruch son of Neriah is inciting you against us to deliver us into the hands of the Babylonians, so they may kill us or exile us to Babylon.”

## Jeremiah 43:4
Thus Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces, along with all the people, did not obey the Lord’s command to remain in the land of Judah.

## Jeremiah 43:5
Instead, Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces took the entire remnant of Judah who had returned from all the nations where they had been scattered, to reside in the land of Judah—

## Jeremiah 43:6
the men, the women, the children, the king’s daughters, and everyone whom Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, had left with Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, along with Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch son of Neriah—

## Jeremiah 43:7
and they entered Egypt, disobeying the voice of the Lord, and went as far as Tahpanhes.

## Jeremiah 43:8
In Tahpanhes, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying,

## Jeremiah 43:9
“Take some large stones in your hands and bury them in the clay in the brick terrace at the entrance to Pharaoh’s palace in Tahpanhes, in the sight of some of the Jews;

## Jeremiah 43:10
and say to them, ‘This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I will send for my servant Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and I will set his throne over these stones I have hidden; he will spread his royal canopy over them.

## Jeremiah 43:11
He will come and strike the land of Egypt, delivering those destined for death to death, those for captivity to captivity, and those for the sword to the sword.

## Jeremiah 43:12
He will set fire to the temples of the gods of Egypt; he will burn them and take their gods captive. As a shepherd wraps himself with his garment, so he will wrap himself with Egypt and depart safely.

## Jeremiah 43:13
He will also demolish the obelisks of Heliopolis in the land of Egypt, and the temples of the gods of Egypt he will burn with fire.’”
