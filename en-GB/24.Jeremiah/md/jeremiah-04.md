# Jeremiah Chapter 4

## Jeremiah 4:1
“If you, Israel, are to return,” declares the Lord, “then return to Me. If you remove your detestable idols from My sight and do not stray,

## Jeremiah 4:2
and if you swear, ‘As surely as the Lord lives,’ in truth, in justice, and in righteousness, then the nations will bless themselves by Him and in Him they will glory.”

## Jeremiah 4:3
For this is what the Lord says to the people of Judah and to Jerusalem: “Break up your unploughed ground and do not sow among thorns.

## Jeremiah 4:4
Circumcise yourselves to the Lord and circumcise your hearts, people of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem, or My wrath will flare up like fire and burn with no one to quench it, because of the evil of your deeds.”

## Jeremiah 4:5
“Proclaim in Judah and announce in Jerusalem, and say: ‘Sound the trumpet throughout the land!’ Cry aloud and say: ‘Assemble yourselves and let us flee to the fortified cities!’

## Jeremiah 4:6
Raise a signal towards Zion! Flee for safety without delay! For I am bringing disaster from the north, even great destruction.”

## Jeremiah 4:7
A lion has come up from his thicket; a destroyer of nations has set out. He has left his place to lay waste your land. Your towns will be ruined without inhabitant.

## Jeremiah 4:8
For this, put on sackcloth, lament and wail, for the fierce anger of the Lord has not turned away from us.

## Jeremiah 4:9
“In that day,” declares the Lord, “the heart of the king and the hearts of the officials will fail; the priests will be horrified, and the prophets will be appalled.”

## Jeremiah 4:10
Then I said, “Alas, Sovereign Lord! Surely You have utterly deceived this people and Jerusalem by saying, ‘You will have peace,’ while the sword is at our throats!”

## Jeremiah 4:11
At that time, it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, “A scorching wind from the barren heights in the desert blows towards My people, not to winnow or cleanse;

## Jeremiah 4:12
a wind too powerful for that comes from Me. Now I announce My judgments against them.”

## Jeremiah 4:13
Behold, he advances like the clouds, his chariots are like a whirlwind, his horses swifter than eagles. Woe to us! We are ruined!

## Jeremiah 4:14
Jerusalem, wash the evil from your heart so that you may be saved. How long will you harbour wicked thoughts?

## Jeremiah 4:15
A voice announces from Dan, proclaiming disaster from the hills of Ephraim.

## Jeremiah 4:16
“Report this to the nations, proclaim concerning Jerusalem: ‘A besieging army is coming from a distant land, raising a war cry against the cities of Judah.

## Jeremiah 4:17
They surround her like watchmen of a field, because she has rebelled against Me,’ declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 4:18
“Your conduct and actions have brought this upon you. This is your punishment. How bitter it is! How it pierces to the heart!”

## Jeremiah 4:19
Oh, my anguish, my anguish! I writhe in pain. Oh, the agony of my heart! My heart pounds within me, I cannot keep silent. For I have heard the sound of the trumpet; the alarm of war.

## Jeremiah 4:20
Disaster upon disaster is proclaimed; the whole land is devastated. In an instant my tents are destroyed, my shelters in a moment.

## Jeremiah 4:21
How long must I witness the battle standard and hear the sound of the trumpet?

## Jeremiah 4:22
“For My people are foolish; they do not know Me. They are senseless children; they have no understanding. They are skilled in doing evil; they do not know how to do good.”

## Jeremiah 4:23
I observed the earth, and it was formless and empty; and at the heavens, and their light was gone.

## Jeremiah 4:24
I observed the mountains, and they were quaking; all the hills were swaying.

## Jeremiah 4:25
I observed, and there were no people; every bird in the sky had flown away.

## Jeremiah 4:26
I observed, and the fruitful land was a desert; all its towns lay in ruins before the Lord, in the face of His fierce anger.

## Jeremiah 4:27
For this is what the Lord says: “The whole land will be a desolation, yet I will not destroy it completely.

## Jeremiah 4:28
Therefore the earth will mourn and the heavens above grow dark, because I have spoken and will not relent, I have purposed and will not turn back.”

## Jeremiah 4:29
At the sound of horsemen and archers every town takes to flight; they go into the thickets and climb among the rocks. Every town is deserted; no one lives in them.

## Jeremiah 4:30
And you, devastated one, what will you do? Although you dress in scarlet, although you put on jewels of gold, although you highlight your eyes with makeup, in vain you make yourself beautiful. Your lovers despise you; they seek your life.

## Jeremiah 4:31
I hear a cry as of a woman in labour, a groan as of one bearing her first child—the cry of Daughter Zion gasping for breath, stretching out her hands and saying, “Alas! I am fainting; my life is given over to murderers.”
