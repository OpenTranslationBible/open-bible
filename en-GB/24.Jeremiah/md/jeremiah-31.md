## Jeremiah 31:1
"In those days," declares the Lord, "I will be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be my people."

## Jeremiah 31:2
This is what the Lord says: “The people who survived the sword found grace in the wilderness; I came to give rest to Israel.”

## Jeremiah 31:3
The Lord appeared to us long ago, saying, “I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore I have drawn you with unfailing kindness.”

## Jeremiah 31:4
“I will build you up again, and you, Virgin of Israel, will be rebuilt. You will take up your tambourines again and go out to dance with the joyful.”

## Jeremiah 31:5
“Again you will plant vineyards on the hills of Samaria; the farmers will plant them and enjoy the fruit.”

## Jeremiah 31:6
“For there will be a day when watchmen cry out on the hills of Ephraim, ‘Arise, let us go up to Zion, to the Lord our God.’”

## Jeremiah 31:7
This is what the Lord says: “Sing with joy for Jacob; shout for the foremost of the nations. Proclaim, give praise, and say, ‘Lord, save your people, the remnant of Israel.’”

## Jeremiah 31:8
“Behold, I will bring them from the land of the north and gather them from the ends of the earth. Among them will be the blind and the lame, pregnant women and those in labour; a great assembly will return.”

## Jeremiah 31:9
“They will come with weeping; by pleading I will bring them. I will lead them beside streams of water on a straight path where they will not stumble, for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.”

## Jeremiah 31:10
"Listen to the word of the Lord, you nations; announce it in distant coastlands: ‘He who scattered Israel will gather them and will watch over his flock like a shepherd.’"

## Jeremiah 31:11
“For the Lord will ransom Jacob and redeem them from the hand of those stronger than they.”

## Jeremiah 31:12
“They will come and shout for joy on the heights of Zion; they will be radiant over the bounty of the Lord—over the grain, the new wine and the oil, and over the young of the flocks and herds. Their life will be like a well-watered garden, and they will never languish again.”

## Jeremiah 31:13
“Then young women will rejoice in the dance, and young men and old as well. I will turn their mourning into joy; I will comfort them and give them joy instead of sorrow.”

## Jeremiah 31:14
“I will provide the priests with plenty, and my people will be filled with my goodness,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 31:15
This is what the Lord says: “A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation and bitter weeping, Rachel weeping for her children, refusing to be comforted, because they are no more.”

## Jeremiah 31:16
This is what the Lord says: “Hold back your voice from weeping and your eyes from tears, for your work will be rewarded,” declares the Lord. “They will return from the land of the enemy.”

## Jeremiah 31:17
“So there is hope for your future,” declares the Lord. “Your children will return to their own land.”

## Jeremiah 31:18
“I have surely heard Ephraim grieving, ‘You disciplined me like an unruly calf, and I have been corrected. Restore me, and I will return, for you are the Lord my God.’”

## Jeremiah 31:19
“After I strayed, I repented; after I was instructed, I slapped my thigh. I was ashamed and humiliated because I bore the disgrace of my youth.”

## Jeremiah 31:20
“Is not Ephraim my dear son, the child in whom I delight? Though I often speak against him, I still remember him. Therefore my heart yearns for him; I will surely have mercy on him,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 31:21
“Set up road signs; put up guideposts. Direct your mind to the highway, the way by which you went. Return, Virgin Israel, return to your towns.”

## Jeremiah 31:22
“How long will you wander, unfaithful daughter Israel? For the Lord has created a new thing on earth—a woman will shelter a man.”

## Jeremiah 31:23
This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: “When I restore their fortunes, the people in the land of Judah and in its towns will once again use these words: ‘The Lord bless you, O place of righteousness, O holy hill!’”

## Jeremiah 31:24
“The inhabitants of Judah and all its towns will live together—farmers and those who move about with their flocks.”

## Jeremiah 31:25
“For I will refresh the weary and satisfy the faint.”

## Jeremiah 31:26
At this point, I awoke and looked around, and my sleep had been pleasant to me.

## Jeremiah 31:27
“Behold, the days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of people and animals.”

## Jeremiah 31:28
“Just as I watched over them to uproot and tear down, to overthrow, destroy and bring disaster, so I will watch over them to build and to plant,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 31:29
“In those days people will no longer say, ‘The parents have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge.’

## Jeremiah 31:30
“Instead, each person will die for their own sin; whoever eats sour grapes—their own teeth will be set on edge.”

## Jeremiah 31:31
“Behold, the days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah.”

## Jeremiah 31:32
“It will not resemble the covenant I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, because they broke my covenant, though I was like a husband to them,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 31:33
“For this is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel after those days,” declares the Lord: “I will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people.”

## Jeremiah 31:34
“No longer will they teach their neighbour, or say to one another, ‘Know the Lord,’ for they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest,” declares the Lord. “For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.”

## Jeremiah 31:35
This is what the Lord says, he who appoints the sun to shine by day, who decrees the moon and stars to shine by night, who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar—the Lord Almighty is his name:

## Jeremiah 31:36
“Only if these decrees vanish from my sight,” declares the Lord, “will the descendants of Israel ever cease to be a nation before me.”

## Jeremiah 31:37
This is what the Lord says: “Only if the heavens above can be measured and the foundations of the earth below be explored will I reject all the descendants of Israel because of all they have done,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 31:38
“Behold, the days are coming,” declares the Lord, “when the city will be rebuilt for the Lord from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate.”

## Jeremiah 31:39
“The measuring line will go out straight to the hill of Gareb and then turn to Goah.”

## Jeremiah 31:40
“The entire valley where dead bodies and ashes are thrown, and all the terraces out to the Kidron Valley on the east as far as the corner of the Horse Gate, will be holy to the Lord. The city will never again be uprooted or demolished.”
