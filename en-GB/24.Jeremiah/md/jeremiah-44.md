# Jeremiah Chapter 44

## Jeremiah 44:1  
The word that came to Jeremiah for all the Jews living in the land of Egypt, those who were living in Migdol, Tahpanhes, Memphis, and the land of Pathros, saying,

## Jeremiah 44:2  
“This is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel says: ‘You yourselves have seen all the disaster that I have brought on Jerusalem and all the cities of Judah;  
and behold, they are in ruins this day, and no one lives in them,

## Jeremiah 44:3  
because of their wickedness which they committed to provoke Me to anger,  
by continuing to burn sacrifices and to serve other gods whom they had not known, neither they, you, nor your fathers.

## Jeremiah 44:4  
Yet I sent you all My servants the prophets again and again, saying,  
“Oh, do not do this abominable thing which I hate!”

## Jeremiah 44:5  
But they did not listen or incline their ears to turn from their wickedness, so as not to burn sacrifices to other gods.

## Jeremiah 44:6  
Therefore My wrath and My anger gushed out and burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem,  
so they have become a ruin and a desolation, as it is this day.

## Jeremiah 44:7  
Now then, this is what the Lord God of armies, the God of Israel says:  
‘Why are you doing great harm to yourselves, to eliminate from yourselves man and woman, child and infant, from among Judah,  
leaving yourselves without a remnant,

## Jeremiah 44:8  
provoking Me to anger with the works of your hands, burning sacrifices to other gods in the land of Egypt where you are entering to reside,  
so that you may be eliminated and become a curse and an object of cursing among all the nations of the earth?

## Jeremiah 44:9  
Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, the wickedness of the kings of Judah,  
the wickedness of their wives, your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives,  
which they committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?

## Jeremiah 44:10  
Yet they have not become contrite even to this day, nor have they feared,  
nor walked in My Law or My statutes, which I placed before you and before your fathers.’

## Jeremiah 44:11  
Therefore this is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel says:  
‘Behold, I am determined to bring disaster on you, to eliminate all Judah.

## Jeremiah 44:12  
And I will take away the remnant of Judah who have set their mind on entering the land of Egypt to reside there,  
and they will all meet their end in the land of Egypt; they will fall by the sword and meet their end by famine.  
Both small and great will die by the sword and famine; and they will become a curse, an object of horror, an imprecation, and a disgrace.

## Jeremiah 44:13  
And I will punish those who live in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, with the sword, famine, and plague.

## Jeremiah 44:14  
So there will be no survivor or anyone who escapes from the remnant of Judah who have entered the land of Egypt to reside there,  
and then to return to the land of Judah to which they are longing to return to live; for none will return except a few refugees.’”

## Jeremiah 44:15  
Then all the men who were aware that their wives were burning sacrifices to other gods,  
along with all the women who were standing by, a great assembly, including all the people who were living in Pathros in the land of Egypt,  
responded to Jeremiah, saying,

## Jeremiah 44:16  
“As for the message that you have spoken to us in the name of the Lord, we are not going to listen to you!

## Jeremiah 44:17  
But we will certainly carry out every word that has proceeded from our mouths, by burning sacrifices to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her,  
just as we ourselves, our fathers, our kings, and our officials did in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem;  
for then we had plenty of food and were well off and saw no disaster.

## Jeremiah 44:18  
But since we stopped burning sacrifices to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked everything and have met our end by the sword and famine.”

## Jeremiah 44:19  
“And,” said the women, “when we were burning sacrifices to the queen of heaven and were pouring out drink offerings to her,  
was it without our husbands that we made for her sacrificial cakes in her image, and poured out drink offerings to her?”

## Jeremiah 44:20  
Then Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men and women—even to all the people who were giving him such an answer—saying,

## Jeremiah 44:21  
“As for the smoking sacrifices that you burned in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem,  
you, your fathers, your kings, your officials, and the people of the land—did the Lord not remember them, and did all this not come into His mind?

## Jeremiah 44:22  
So the Lord was no longer able to endure it, because of the evil of your deeds, because of the abominations which you committed;  
thus your land has become a place of ruin, an object of horror, a curse, and without inhabitant, as it is this day.

## Jeremiah 44:23  
Since you have burned sacrifices and have sinned against the Lord and not obeyed the voice of the Lord or walked in His Law, His statutes, or His testimonies,  
therefore this disaster has happened to you, as it has this day.”

## Jeremiah 44:24  
Then Jeremiah said to all the people, including all the women,  
“Hear the word of the Lord, all you of Judah who are in the land of Egypt.

## Jeremiah 44:25  
This is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel says: ‘As for you and your wives, you have spoken with your mouths and fulfilled it with your hands, saying,  
“We will certainly perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn sacrifices to the queen of heaven and pour out drink offerings to her.”  
Go ahead, confirm your vows, and certainly perform your vows!’

## Jeremiah 44:26  
Nevertheless, hear the word of the Lord, all Judah who are living in the land of Egypt:  
‘Behold, I have sworn by My great name,’ says the Lord, ‘that My name shall never again be invoked by the mouth of any person of Judah in all the land of Egypt,  
saying, “As the Lord God lives.”

## Jeremiah 44:27  
Behold, I am watching over them for harm and not for good,  
and all the people of Judah who are in the land of Egypt will meet their end by the sword or by famine until they cease to exist.

## Jeremiah 44:28  
Those who escape the sword will return from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah few in number.  
Then all the remnant of Judah who have gone to the land of Egypt to reside there will know whose word will stand, Mine or theirs.

## Jeremiah 44:29  
And this will be the sign to you,’ declares the Lord, ‘that I am going to punish you in this place,  
so that you may know that My words will assuredly stand against you for harm.’

## Jeremiah 44:30  
This is what the Lord says:  
‘Behold, I am going to hand Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt over to his enemies,  
to those who seek his life,  
just as I handed Zedekiah king of Judah over to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, his enemy who was seeking his life.’”
