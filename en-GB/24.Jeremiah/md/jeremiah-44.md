# Jeremiah Chapter 44

## Jeremiah 44:1
The message that came to Jeremiah for all the Jews residing in the land of Egypt, those dwelling in Migdol, Tahpanhes, Memphis, and the region of Pathros, saying,

## Jeremiah 44:2
“This is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, declares: You yourselves have witnessed the disaster I brought upon Jerusalem and all the towns of Judah; they are now desolate and uninhabited,

## Jeremiah 44:3
because of their evil deeds which provoked Me to anger by burning sacrifices and serving other gods whom neither they, you, nor your ancestors knew.

## Jeremiah 44:4
I sent all My servants the prophets to you repeatedly, saying, ‘Do not commit this abominable act that I detest.’

## Jeremiah 44:5
But you did not listen or incline your ears to turn from your wickedness, to cease burning sacrifices to other gods.

## Jeremiah 44:6
Therefore, My wrath and anger were poured out and burned in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem, leaving them in ruins and desolation as they are today.

## Jeremiah 44:7
Now, this is what the Lord God of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: Why are you bringing such great harm upon yourselves, cutting off from Judah man and woman, child and infant, leaving yourselves without a remnant?

## Jeremiah 44:8
Why do you provoke Me to anger with the works of your hands, burning sacrifices to other gods in the land of Egypt where you reside, so that you may be destroyed and become a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?

## Jeremiah 44:9
Have you forgotten the wickedness of your ancestors, the wickedness of the kings of Judah, the wickedness of their wives, your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they committed in the land of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem?

## Jeremiah 44:10
To this day, they have not humbled themselves or shown reverence, nor have they followed My law and decrees that I set before you and your ancestors.

## Jeremiah 44:11
Therefore, this is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: I am determined to bring disaster upon you and to eliminate all of Judah.

## Jeremiah 44:12
I will take away the remnant of Judah who have set their minds on entering Egypt to reside there, and they will all meet their end in Egypt; they will fall by the sword or perish by famine. From the least to the greatest, they will die by the sword and famine, becoming a curse, an object of horror, an imprecation, and a disgrace.

## Jeremiah 44:13
I will punish those who live in Egypt with the sword, famine, and plague, just as I punished Jerusalem.

## Jeremiah 44:14
None of the remnant of Judah who have gone to live in Egypt will escape or survive to return to the land of Judah, to which they long to return and live; none will return except a few refugees.

## Jeremiah 44:15
Then all the men who knew that their wives were burning sacrifices to other gods, along with all the women standing by—a large assembly—and all the people living in Pathros in the land of Egypt, responded to Jeremiah,

## Jeremiah 44:16
“We will not listen to the message you have spoken to us in the name of the Lord!

## Jeremiah 44:17
We will certainly carry out every word that has proceeded from our mouths, by burning sacrifices to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, just as we, our ancestors, our kings, and our leaders did in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem. At that time, we had plenty of food, were well off, and saw no misfortune.

## Jeremiah 44:18
But since we stopped burning sacrifices to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her, we have lacked everything and have been perishing by sword and famine.”

## Jeremiah 44:19
The women added, “When we burned sacrifices to the queen of heaven and poured out drink offerings to her, was it without our husbands that we made cakes in her image and poured out drink offerings to her?”

## Jeremiah 44:20
Then Jeremiah said to all the people, both men and women, who were giving him this answer,

## Jeremiah 44:21
“Did not the Lord remember and call to mind the sacrifices burned in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem by you and your ancestors, your kings and your leaders, and the people of the land?

## Jeremiah 44:22
The Lord could no longer endure your wicked actions and the detestable things you did, so your land became a curse and a desolate waste without inhabitants, as it is today.

## Jeremiah 44:23
Because you have burned sacrifices and sinned against the Lord and have not obeyed Him or followed His law, His statutes, or His testimonies, this disaster has come upon you, as you now see.”

## Jeremiah 44:24
Then Jeremiah said to all the people, including all the women, “Hear the word of the Lord, all Judah who are in the land of Egypt.

## Jeremiah 44:25
This is what the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: You and your wives have spoken with your mouths and fulfilled it with your hands, saying, ‘We will certainly perform our vows to burn sacrifices to the queen of heaven and pour out drink offerings to her.’ By all means, fulfil your vows and perform them!

## Jeremiah 44:26
But hear the word of the Lord, all Judah living in the land of Egypt: ‘I have sworn by My great name,’ says the Lord, ‘that My name shall never again be invoked by the mouth of any of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, “As the Lord God lives.”

## Jeremiah 44:27
For I am watching over them for harm and not for good; all the people of Judah who are in the land of Egypt will meet their end by the sword or by famine until they are completely gone.

## Jeremiah 44:28
Those who escape the sword will return from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah few in number. Then all the remnant of Judah who have gone to live in Egypt will know whose word will stand—Mine or theirs.

## Jeremiah 44:29
This will be the sign to you,’ declares the Lord, ‘that I am going to punish you in this place, so that you may know that My words will assuredly stand against you for harm.’

## Jeremiah 44:30
This is what the Lord says: ‘I am going to hand Pharaoh Hophra, king of Egypt, over to his enemies, to those who seek his life, just as I handed Zedekiah, king of Judah, over to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, who was his enemy and sought his life.’”
