# Jeremiah Chapter 17

## Jeremiah 17:1

The sin of Judah is etched with an iron tool, engraved with a flint point upon the tablets of their hearts and on the horns of their altars.

## Jeremiah 17:2

As their children remember, so do they recall their altars and Asherah poles beside the lush trees and on the high hills.

## Jeremiah 17:3

My mountain in the countryside, your wealth and all your treasures I shall surrender as plunder, along with your high places, due to sin throughout your territory.

## Jeremiah 17:4

Through your own actions, you shall relinquish the inheritance I bestowed upon you; I will cause you to serve your adversaries in a land unknown to you, for you have ignited a fire of anger within me which will burn perpetually.

But if you do not listen to me to keep the Sabbath day holy by not carrying any load as you come through the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day, then I will kindle a fire in its gates, and it will consume the fortresses of Jerusalem and will not be quenched.”
