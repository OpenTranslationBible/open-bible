# Jeremiah Chapter 14

## Jeremiah 14:1  
That which came as the word of the Lord to Jeremiah regarding the drought:

## Jeremiah 14:2  
“Judah mourns,  
And her gates languish;  
They sit on the ground in mourning,  
And the cry of Jerusalem has ascended.

## Jeremiah 14:3  
Their nobles have sent their servants for water;  
They have come to the cisterns and found no water.  
They have returned with their containers empty;  
They have been put to shame and humiliated,  
And they cover their heads,

## Jeremiah 14:4  
Because the ground is cracked,  
Since there has been no rain on the land.  
The farmers have been put to shame,  
They have covered their heads.

## Jeremiah 14:5  
For even the doe in the field has given birth only to abandon her young,  
Because there is no grass.

## Jeremiah 14:6  
The wild donkeys stand on the bare heights;  
They pant for air like jackals,  
Their eyes fail  
Because there is no vegetation.”

## Jeremiah 14:7  
Although our wrongdoings testify against us, Lord, act for the sake of Your name!  
Our apostasies have indeed been many,  
We have sinned against You.

## Jeremiah 14:8  
Hope of Israel,  
Its Savior in time of distress,  
Why are You like a stranger in the land,  
Or like a traveler who has pitched his tent for the night?

## Jeremiah 14:9  
Why are You like a confused person,  
Like a warrior who cannot save?  
Yet You are in our midst, Lord,  
And we are called by Your name;  
Do not leave us!

## Jeremiah 14:10  
This is what the Lord says to this people:  
“So much they have loved to wander;  
They have not restrained their feet.  
Therefore the Lord does not accept them;  
Now He will remember their guilt  
And punish their sins.”

## Jeremiah 14:11  
So the Lord said to me, “Do not pray for a good outcome on behalf of this people.

## Jeremiah 14:12  
When they fast, I am not going to listen to their cry;  
And when they offer burnt offerings and grain offerings, I am not going to accept them.  
Rather, I am going to put an end to them by the sword, famine, and plague.”

## Jeremiah 14:13  
But I said, “Oh, Lord God! Behold, the prophets are telling them, ‘You will not see the sword nor will you have famine,  
But I will give you lasting peace in this place.’”

## Jeremiah 14:14  
Then the Lord said to me,  
“The prophets are prophesying falsehood in My name.  
I have neither sent them nor commanded them, nor spoken to them;  
They are prophesying to you a false vision, divination, futility, and the deception of their own minds.

## Jeremiah 14:15  
Therefore this is what the Lord says concerning the prophets who are prophesying in My name,  
Though I did not send them—yet they keep saying, ‘There will be no sword or famine in this land’:  
By sword and famine those prophets shall meet their end!

## Jeremiah 14:16  
The people also to whom they are prophesying will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword,  
And there will be no one to bury them—neither them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters.  
For I will pour out their own wickedness upon them.

## Jeremiah 14:17  
You will say this word to them:  
‘Let my eyes stream down tears night and day,  
And let them not cease;  
For the virgin daughter of my people has been crushed with a mighty blow,  
With a severely infected wound.

## Jeremiah 14:18  
If I go out to the field,  
Behold, those slain with the sword!  
Or if I enter the city,  
Behold, diseases from the famine!  
For both prophet and priest  
Have gone around in the land that they do not know.’”

## Jeremiah 14:19  
Have You completely rejected Judah?  
Or have You loathed Zion?  
Why have You stricken us so that there is no healing for us?  
We waited for peace, but nothing good came;  
And for a time of healing, but behold, terror!

## Jeremiah 14:20  
We know our wickedness, Lord,  
The guilt of our fathers,  
For we have sinned against You.

## Jeremiah 14:21  
Do not despise us, for the sake of Your name;  
Do not disgrace the throne of Your glory.  
Remember and do not annul Your covenant with us.

## Jeremiah 14:22  
Are there any among the idols of the nations who give rain?  
Or can the heavens grant showers?  
Is it not You, Lord our God?  
Therefore we hope in You,  
For You are the one who has done all these things.
