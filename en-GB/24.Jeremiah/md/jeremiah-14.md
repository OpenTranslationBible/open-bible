# Jeremiah Chapter 14

## Jeremiah 14:1
This is the word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah regarding the drought:

## Jeremiah 14:2
“Judah mourns, and her gates languish; her people sit on the ground in mourning garments, and a cry rises from Jerusalem.

## Jeremiah 14:3
The nobles send their servants for water; they go to the cisterns but find no water. They return with their containers empty, put to shame and humiliated, they cover their heads.

## Jeremiah 14:4
The ground is cracked because there is no rain on the land; the farmers are dismayed and cover their heads in shame.

## Jeremiah 14:5
Even the doe in the field abandons her newborn fawn because there is no grass.

## Jeremiah 14:6
Wild donkeys stand on the barren heights, panting for air like jackals; their eyes fail for lack of vegetation.

## Jeremiah 14:7
Though our wrongdoings testify against us, act, Lord, for the sake of your name. Our apostasies have indeed been many; we have sinned against you.

## Jeremiah 14:8
Hope of Israel, its Saviour in times of distress, why are you like a stranger in the land, like a traveller who stays only a night?

## Jeremiah 14:9
Why are you like a confused person, like a warrior who cannot save? Yet you are among us, Lord, and we are called by your name; do not forsake us!

## Jeremiah 14:10
This is what the Lord says about this people: “They greatly love to wander; they do not restrain their feet. Therefore, the Lord does not accept them; now he will remember their wrongdoing and punish them for their sins.”

## Jeremiah 14:11
Then the Lord said to me, “Do not pray for the well-being of this people.

## Jeremiah 14:12
Even though they fast, I will not listen to their cry; though they offer burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them. Instead, I will destroy them with the sword, famine, and plague.”

## Jeremiah 14:13
But I said, “Alas, Sovereign Lord! The prophets keep telling them, ‘You will not see the sword or suffer famine. Indeed, I will give you lasting peace in this place.’”

## Jeremiah 14:14
Then the Lord said to me, “The prophets are prophesying falsehood in my name. I have not sent them, nor commanded them, nor spoken to them. They are prophesying to you false visions, divinations, futility, and the delusions of their own minds.

## Jeremiah 14:15
Therefore, this is what the Lord says about the prophets who are prophesying in my name: I did not send them, yet they are saying, ‘No sword or famine will touch this land.’ By sword and famine, those prophets shall meet their end.

## Jeremiah 14:16
And the people to whom they are prophesying will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword. There will be no one to bury them, their wives, their sons, and their daughters. I will pour out their own wickedness upon them.

## Jeremiah 14:17
You shall speak this word to them: “‘Let my eyes overflow with tears night and day without ceasing; for the virgin daughter, my people, has suffered a grievous wound, a crushing blow.

## Jeremiah 14:18
If I go out to the country, I see those slain by the sword; if I enter the city, I see the ravages of famine. Both prophet and priest have wandered into a land they do not know.’”

## Jeremiah 14:19
Have you completely rejected Judah? Do you despise Zion? Why have you afflicted us so that we cannot be healed? We hoped for peace, but no good has come; for a time of healing, but there is only terror.

## Jeremiah 14:20
We acknowledge our wickedness, Lord, and the guilt of our ancestors; we have indeed sinned against you.

## Jeremiah 14:21
For the sake of your name, do not despise us; do not disgrace your glorious throne. Remember your covenant with us and do not annul it.

## Jeremiah 14:22
Do any of the worthless idols of the nations bring rain? Do the skies themselves send down showers? Is it not you, Lord our God? Therefore, we wait for you, for you are the one who does all these things.
