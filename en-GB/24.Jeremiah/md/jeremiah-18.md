# Jeremiah Chapter 18

## Jeremiah 18:1

The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying:

## Jeremiah 18:2

“Rise and go down to the potter’s house, and there I will convey My words to you.”

## Jeremiah 18:3

So I went down to the potter’s house, and I found him working on the wheel.

## Jeremiah 18:4

But the vessel he was crafting from the clay was flawed in the potter’s hand; so he reformed it into another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to make.

## Jeremiah 18:5

Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying:

## Jeremiah 18:6

“Can I not do with you, house of Israel, as this potter does?” declares the Lord. “Behold, as the clay is in the potter’s hand, so are you in My hand, house of Israel.

## Jeremiah 18:7

At any moment I may speak concerning a nation or a kingdom, to uproot it, to tear it down, or to destroy it;

## Jeremiah 18:8

if that nation against which I have spoken turns from its evil, I will relent of the disaster that I intended to bring upon it.

## Jeremiah 18:9

Or at another moment I may speak concerning a nation or a kingdom, to build it up or to plant it;

## Jeremiah 18:10

if it does evil in My sight by not obeying My voice, then I will reconsider the good I had promised to do for it.

## Jeremiah 18:11

Now therefore, speak to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, ‘This is what the Lord says: “Behold, I am shaping a disaster against you and devising a plan against you. Turn now, each one from his evil way, and amend your ways and your deeds!”’

## Jeremiah 18:12

But they will say, ‘It is hopeless! We will follow our own plans, and each of us will act according to the stubbornness of his evil heart.’

## Jeremiah 18:13

Therefore this is what the Lord says: ‘Ask among the nations, Who has heard anything like this? The virgin of Israel has done a most dreadful thing.

## Jeremiah 18:14

Does the snow of Lebanon abandon the rocky slopes? Or do the cool waters from distant sources ever cease to flow?

## Jeremiah 18:15

Yet My people have forgotten Me; they burn incense to worthless idols, and they have stumbled in their ways, in the ancient paths, to walk in byways, not on a highway.

## Jeremiah 18:16

Their land will become a desolation, an object of perpetual scorn; all who pass by it will be appalled and will shake their heads.

## Jeremiah 18:17

Like an east wind, I will scatter them before the enemy; I will show them My back and not My face in the day of their calamity.’”

## Jeremiah 18:18

Then they said, “Come, let us devise plans against Jeremiah. Certainly the law will not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, let us attack him with our tongues, and pay no heed to any of his words.”

## Jeremiah 18:19

Hear me, Lord, and listen to what my adversaries are saying!

## Jeremiah 18:20

Should good be repaid with evil? For they have dug a pit for me. Remember how I stood before You to speak on their behalf, to turn Your wrath away from them.

## Jeremiah 18:21

Therefore, deliver their children to famine, and hand them over to the power of the sword; let their wives become childless and widows. Let their men be put to death, their young men struck down by the sword in battle.

## Jeremiah 18:22

Let a cry be heard from their houses when You suddenly bring raiders upon them; for they have dug a pit to capture me and have hidden snares for my feet.

## Jeremiah 18:23

But You, Lord, know all their schemes against me to kill me. Do not forgive their iniquity or blot out their sin from Your sight. Let them be overthrown before You; deal with them in the time of Your anger.
