## Jeremiah 21:2

“Please inquire of the Lord on our behalf, because Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is waging war against us. Perhaps the Lord will act for us according to all His marvellous deeds, so that the enemy will withdraw from us.”

## Jeremiah 21:3

But Jeremiah said to them, “This is what you shall say to Zedekiah:

## Jeremiah 21:4

‘This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Behold, I am about to turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, which you are using to fight against the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans who are besieging you outside the wall; and I will gather them into the midst of this city.

## Jeremiah 21:5

I Myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and a mighty arm, in anger, fury, and great indignation.

## Jeremiah 21:6

I will strike the inhabitants of this city, both people and animals; they will die from a severe plague.

## Jeremiah 21:7

Afterwards, declares the Lord, I will hand over Zedekiah king of Judah, his officials, and the people who survive in this city from the plague, sword, and famine, to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, to their enemies, and to those who seek their lives. He will strike them down with the sword; he will show no mercy, pity, or compassion.’

Behold, I am against you, you who dwell in the valley, on the rocky plateau, declares the Lord— you who say, “Who can come down against us? Who can enter our dwellings?”
