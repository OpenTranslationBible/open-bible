## Jeremiah 21:2

## Jeremiah 21:4  
‘This is what the Lord, the God of Israel says:  
“Behold, I am going to turn back the weapons of war which are in your hands,  
With which you are waging war against the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans who are besieging you outside the wall;  
And I will gather them into the center of this city.

## Jeremiah 21:5  
Then I Myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and a mighty arm,  
With anger, wrath, and great indignation.

## Jeremiah 21:6  
I will also strike the inhabitants of this city, both people and animals;  
They will die of a great plague.

## Jeremiah 21:7  
Then afterward,” declares the Lord,  
“I will hand Zedekiah king of Judah, his servants, and the people—those who survive in this city from the plague, the sword, and the famine—into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,  
And into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their lives;  
And he will strike them with the edge of the sword.  
He will not spare them nor have pity nor compassion.”’

## Jeremiah 21:9

But anyone who goes out and surrenders to the Chaldeans who are besieging you will live,  
And he will have his own life as plunder.

## Jeremiah 21:10

## Jeremiah 21:12  
House of David, this is what the Lord says:  
Administer justice every morning,  
And save the one who has been robbed from the power of his oppressor,  
So that My wrath will not spread like fire  
And burn with no one to extinguish it,  
Because of the evil of their deeds.

## Jeremiah 21:13

You rocky plain,” declares the Lord,  
“You who say, ‘Who will come down against us?  
Or who will enter our dwellings?’

## Jeremiah 21:14  
But I will punish you according to the results of your deeds,” declares the Lord,  
“And I will kindle a fire in its forest  
And it will devour all its surroundings.”’
