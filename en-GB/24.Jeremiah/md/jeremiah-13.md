# Jeremiah Chapter 13

## Jeremiah 13:1  
This is what the Lord said to me: “Go and buy yourself a linen waistband and put it around your waist, but do not put it in water.”

## Jeremiah 13:2  
So I bought the waistband in accordance with the word of the Lord, and put it around my waist.

## Jeremiah 13:3  
Then the word of the Lord came to me a second time, saying,

## Jeremiah 13:4  
“Take the waistband that you bought, which is around your waist, and go now to the Euphrates and hide it there in a crevice of the rock.”

## Jeremiah 13:5  
So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as the Lord had commanded me.

## Jeremiah 13:6  
After many days the Lord said to me, “Arise, go to the Euphrates and take from there the waistband which I commanded you to hide there.”

## Jeremiah 13:7  
Then I went to the Euphrates and dug up and took the waistband from the place where I had hidden it; and behold, the waistband was ruined, it was completely useless.

## Jeremiah 13:8  
Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying,

## Jeremiah 13:9  
“This is what the Lord says: ‘To the same extent I will destroy the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem.

## Jeremiah 13:10  
This wicked people, who refuse to listen to My words, who walk in the stubbornness of their hearts and have followed other gods to serve them and to bow down to them,  
Let them be like this waistband, which is completely useless.

## Jeremiah 13:11  
For as the waistband clings to the waist of a man, so I made the entire household of Israel and the entire household of Judah cling to Me,’ declares the Lord,  
‘So that they might be My people, for renown, for praise, and for glory; but they did not listen.’

## Jeremiah 13:12  
“Therefore you are to speak this word to them:  
‘This is what the Lord, the God of Israel says: “Every jug is to be filled with wine.”’  
And when they say to you, ‘Do we not very well know that every jug is to be filled with wine?’

## Jeremiah 13:13  
Then say to them, ‘This is what the Lord says: “Behold, I am going to fill all the inhabitants of this land—the kings who sit on David’s throne, the priests, the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem—with drunkenness!

## Jeremiah 13:14  
Then I will smash them against each other, the fathers and the sons together,” declares the Lord.  
“I will not have compassion nor be troubled nor take pity so as to keep from destroying them.”’”

## Jeremiah 13:15  
Listen and pay attention, do not be haughty,  
For the Lord has spoken.

## Jeremiah 13:16  
Give glory to the Lord your God  
Before He brings darkness  
And before your feet stumble  
On the dusky mountains,  
And while you are hoping for light  
He makes it into deep darkness,  
And turns it into gloom.

## Jeremiah 13:17  
But if you will not listen to it,  
My soul will weep in secret for such pride;  
And my eyes will shed tears and stream down  
Because the flock of the Lord has been taken captive.

## Jeremiah 13:18  
Say to the king and the queen mother,  
“Take a lowly seat,  
For your beautiful crown  
Has come down from your head.”

## Jeremiah 13:19  
The cities of the Negev have been locked up,  
And there is no one to open them;  
All Judah has been taken into exile,  
Wholly taken into exile.

## Jeremiah 13:20  
Raise your eyes and see  
Those coming from the north.  
Where is the flock that was given you,  
Your beautiful sheep?

## Jeremiah 13:21  
What will you say when He appoints over you—  
And you yourself had taught them—  
Former companions to be head over you?  
Will labor pains not take hold of you,  
Like a woman in childbirth?

## Jeremiah 13:22  
If you say in your heart,  
“Why have these things happened to me?”  
Because of the magnitude of your wrongdoing  
Your skirts have been removed  
And your heels have suffered violence.

## Jeremiah 13:23  
Can the Ethiopian change his skin,  
Or the leopard his spots?  
Then you as well can do good  
Who are accustomed to doing evil.

## Jeremiah 13:24  
Therefore I will scatter them like drifting straw  
To the desert wind.

## Jeremiah 13:25  
This is your lot, the portion measured to you  
From Me,” declares the Lord,  
“Because you have forgotten Me  
And trusted in falsehood.

## Jeremiah 13:26  
So I Myself have stripped your skirts off over your face,  
So that your shame will be seen.

## Jeremiah 13:27  
As for your adulteries and your lustful neighings,  
The outrageous sin of your prostitution  
On the hills in the field,  
I have seen your abominations.  
Woe to you, Jerusalem!  
How long will you remain unclean?”
