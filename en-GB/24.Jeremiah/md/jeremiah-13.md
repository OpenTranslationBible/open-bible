# Jeremiah Chapter 13

## Jeremiah 13:1

This is what the Lord said to me: “Go and purchase a linen garment and place it around your waist, but do not let it come into contact with water.”

## Jeremiah 13:2

So I acquired the garment as the Lord instructed, and wrapped it around my waist.

## Jeremiah 13:3

Then the word of the Lord came to me once more, saying,

## Jeremiah 13:4

“Take the garment you have bought, which is around your waist, and go to the Euphrates. Conceal it there in a crevice of the rock.”

## Jeremiah 13:5

So I went and concealed it by the Euphrates, as the Lord had commanded me.

## Jeremiah 13:6

After a number of days, the Lord instructed me, “Arise, go to the Euphrates and retrieve the garment that I directed you to hide there.”

## Jeremiah 13:7

So I went to the Euphrates and dug up the garment from the place where I had hidden it; and behold, the garment was ruined and utterly useless.

## Jeremiah 13:8

Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying,

## Jeremiah 13:9

“This is what the Lord says: ‘In the same manner, I will destroy the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem.

## Jeremiah 13:10

These wicked people, who refuse to heed my words, who follow the stubbornness of their hearts and pursue other gods to serve and worship them, will be like this garment—completely useless!

## Jeremiah 13:11

For as a garment clings to the waist of a person, so I made the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah cling to me,’ declares the Lord, ‘that they might be my people, for renown, for praise, and for glory; but they did not listen.’

## Jeremiah 13:12

“Therefore, speak this word to them: ‘This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Every container should be filled with wine.’ And if they respond, ‘Do we not know that every container should be filled with wine?’

## Jeremiah 13:13

then say to them, ‘This is what the Lord says: I am going to fill all the inhabitants of this land—the kings who sit on David’s throne, the priests, the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem—with drunkenness.

## Jeremiah 13:14

I will shatter them against each other, both parents and children alike,” declares the Lord. “I will show no compassion, nor will I spare or have mercy to prevent their destruction.”

## Jeremiah 13:15

Listen and pay attention, do not be arrogant, for the Lord has spoken.

## Jeremiah 13:16

Give glory to the Lord your God before he brings darkness and before your feet stumble on the darkening hills. You hope for light, but he will turn it into deep darkness and transform it into thick gloom.

## Jeremiah 13:17

But if you do not listen, I will weep in secret because of your pride; my eyes will weep bitterly, overflowing with tears, because the Lord’s flock will be taken captive.

## Jeremiah 13:18

Say to the king and the queen mother, “Descend from your thrones, for your splendid crowns will fall from your heads.”

## Jeremiah 13:19

The cities of the Negev will be closed, with no one to open them. All Judah will be taken into exile, completely carried away.

## Jeremiah 13:20

Lift up your eyes and see those coming from the north. Where is the flock that was entrusted to you, the sheep of which you boasted?

## Jeremiah 13:21

What will you say when the Lord sets over you those you cultivated as your allies? Will not pain seize you like that of a woman in labour?

## Jeremiah 13:22

And if you ask yourself, “Why has this happened to me?”— it is because of the magnitude of your sins that your skirts have been torn off and your body mistreated.

## Jeremiah 13:23

Is it possible for an Ethiopian to change his skin or a leopard its spots? In the same way, you who are accustomed to doing evil cannot do good.

## Jeremiah 13:24

“I will disperse you like chaff blown by the desert wind.

## Jeremiah 13:25

This is your lot, the portion I have decreed for you,” declares the Lord, “because you have forgotten me and trusted in falsehood.

## Jeremiah 13:26

I will pull up your skirts over your face so that your shame may be seen—

## Jeremiah 13:27

your adulteries and lustful neighings, your shameless prostitution! I have seen your detestable acts on the hills and in the fields. Woe to you, Jerusalem! How long will you remain unclean?”
