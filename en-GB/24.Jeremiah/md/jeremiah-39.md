# Jeremiah Chapter 39

## Jeremiah 39:1
In the ninth year of Zedekiah, king of Judah, during the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, along with his entire army, advanced upon Jerusalem and laid siege to it.

## Jeremiah 39:2
By the ninth day of the fourth month in Zedekiah’s eleventh year, the wall of the city was breached.

## Jeremiah 39:3
Then all the officials of the Babylonian king entered and took their seats at the Middle Gate: Nergal-Sharezer of Samgar, Nebo-Sarsekim the chief officer, Nergal-Sharezer the high official, and all the other officials of the Babylonian king.

## Jeremiah 39:4
When Zedekiah, king of Judah, and all the soldiers saw them, they fled the city by night through the king’s garden, via the gate between the two walls, and headed towards the Arabah.

## Jeremiah 39:5
However, the Chaldean army pursued them and caught up with Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. They captured him and brought him to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, at Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he pronounced judgement upon him.

## Jeremiah 39:6
At Riblah, the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes and also executed all the nobles of Judah.

## Jeremiah 39:7
He then blinded Zedekiah and bound him with bronze shackles to carry him off to Babylon.

## Jeremiah 39:8
The Chaldeans set fire to the royal palace and the houses of the people, and they demolished the walls of Jerusalem.

## Jeremiah 39:9
Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guard, exiled to Babylon the remaining people in the city, along with those who had defected to him, and the rest of the populace.

## Jeremiah 39:10
Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guard, left behind in the land of Judah some of the poorest people, who owned nothing, and at that time he gave them vineyards and fields.

## Jeremiah 39:11
Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, had issued orders concerning Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guard:

## Jeremiah 39:12
“Take him and look after him; do not harm him, but do for him whatever he requests.”

## Jeremiah 39:13
So Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guard, along with Nebushazban, the chief officer, Nergal-Sharezer, the high official, and all the leading officers of the Babylonian king,

## Jeremiah 39:14
sent and had Jeremiah brought out of the courtyard of the guard. They entrusted him to Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, to take him home. Thus he remained among his own people.

## Jeremiah 39:15
While Jeremiah was confined in the courtyard of the guard, the word of the Lord came to him:

## Jeremiah 39:16
“Go and tell Ebed-Melech the Cushite, ‘This is what the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, says: I am about to bring my words upon this city—words of disaster, not prosperity. They will be fulfilled before your eyes.

## Jeremiah 39:17
But I will rescue you on that day, declares the Lord; you will not be handed over to those you fear.

## Jeremiah 39:18
I will surely save you; you will not fall by the sword but will escape with your life, because you have trusted in me, declares the Lord.’”
