# Jeremiah Chapter 39

## Jeremiah 39:1  
Now when Jerusalem was captured in the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month,  
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came to Jerusalem and besieged it;

## Jeremiah 39:2  
In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the city wall was breached.

## Jeremiah 39:3  
Then all the officials of the king of Babylon entered and sat down at the Middle Gate:  
Nergal-sar-ezer the Rab-mag, Samgar-nebu, Sarsekim the Rab-saris, Nergal-sar-ezer the Rab-mag, and all the rest of the officials of the king of Babylon.

## Jeremiah 39:4  
When Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, they fled and left the city at night by way of the king’s garden through the gate between the two walls;  
and he went out toward the Arabah.

## Jeremiah 39:5  
But the army of the Chaldeans pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho;  
and they seized him and brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath,  
and he passed sentence on him.

## Jeremiah 39:6  
Then the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes at Riblah;  
the king of Babylon also slaughtered all the nobles of Judah.

## Jeremiah 39:7  
He then blinded Zedekiah’s eyes and bound him in shackles of bronze to bring him to Babylon.

## Jeremiah 39:8  
The Chaldeans also burned the king’s palace and the houses of the people with fire,  
and they tore down the walls of Jerusalem.

## Jeremiah 39:9  
Then Nebuzaradan, the captain of the bodyguard, led the rest of the people who were left in the city,  
the deserters who had deserted to him and the rest of the people who remained, into exile to Babylon.

## Jeremiah 39:10  
But some of the poorest people who had nothing,  
Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard left in the land of Judah,  
and gave them vineyards and fields at that time.

## Jeremiah 39:11  
Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave orders regarding Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard, saying,

## Jeremiah 39:12  
“Take him and look after him, and do not harm him, but do for him just as he tells you.”

## Jeremiah 39:13  
So Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard, Nebushazban the Rab-saris, Nergal-sar-ezer the Rab-mag, and all the leading officers of the king of Babylon

## Jeremiah 39:14  
sent word and had Jeremiah taken out of the courtyard of the guardhouse;  
and they entrusted him to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, to take him home.  
So he stayed among the people.

## Jeremiah 39:15  
Now the word of the Lord had come to Jeremiah while he was confined in the courtyard of the guardhouse, saying,

## Jeremiah 39:16  
“Go and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying,  
‘This is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel says:  
“Behold, I am about to bring My words on this city for disaster and not for prosperity;  
and they will take place before you on that day.

## Jeremiah 39:17  
But I will rescue you on that day,” declares the Lord,  
“and you will not be handed over to the men whom you fear.

## Jeremiah 39:18  
For I will certainly save you, and you will not fall by the sword,  
but you will have your own life as plunder,  
because you have trusted in Me,” declares the Lord.’”
