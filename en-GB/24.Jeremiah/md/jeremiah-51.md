## Jeremiah 51:1

“This is the Lord’s message concerning Babylon, about the land of the Babylonians, by Jeremiah the prophet:

## Jeremiah 51:2

“‘Declare and proclaim among the nations, lift up a standard; proclaim it and do not conceal it, say: “Babylon has been captured, Bel has been put to shame, Marduk has been shattered; her images have been put to shame, her idols have been shattered.”

## Jeremiah 51:3

For a nation from the north has come up against her; it will make her land a desolation, a boastful horde; her inhabitants will be driven away, both man and beast.

## Jeremiah 51:4

“‘In those days and at that time,’ declares the Lord, ‘the sounds of rustling wings will be heard in the land of the Babylonians, for I am bringing destruction on them from the land of the north.

## Jeremiah 51:5

“To Babylon the inhabitant, to the land of the Chaldeans, whose former glory has perished—  
Speak, and say, “The young men are struck down in the streets, and their garments are left in shame.

## Jeremiah 51:6

“‘Prepare for war against her!  
Let all who handle the plow turn back and pass by in full armour.

## Jeremiah 51:7

“‘Why put on the finest garments, seeking to be distinguished?  
You who handle the bow, put on your helmet!  
Do not spare the sword; hold back no arrows!  
A nation is coming from the north,  
And a great king will arise from the remote parts of the earth.

## Jeremiah 51:8

He has pitched the tents of his command,  
Covered his gathering places,  
He has gone up to her, and her young men have fallen in her streets.

## Jeremiah 51:9

“‘O bow of the mighty shall be broken, and those fleeing shall walk wounded;  
For the Lord “a judgment has devised against Babylon,  
To destroy the land of the Chaldeans;  
And the land will become an object of desolation, without inhabitant.”

## Jeremiah 51:10

O you who dwell by many waters, abundant in treasures, your end has come,  
The measure of your destruction.

## Jeremiah 51:11

“‘The Lord of armies has sworn by Himself:  
“Surely, I will fill you with men like locusts,  
And with such a multitude of people that the noise of them will amaze you.

## Jeremiah 51:12

You will be eating, be satisfied, and praise the Lord your God,  
Because He has given you your heart’s desire.”  
He enlarges your domain,  
And gives you freedom to the glory of your name.

## Jeremiah 51:13

“‘For the Lord says,  
“Behold, I will defend your cause  
And take vengeance for you.  
I will dry up her sea and make her springs dry.

## Jeremiah 51:14

## Jeremiah 51:16

And her peoples will be weighed down with folly;  
Her officials and her wise men will become fools.

## Jeremiah 51:17

Then I will set foreigners over her,  
And the wicked will be in her midst;  
I will bring their evil to an end,  
And the sound of their songs will be heard no more.

## Jeremiah 51:18

I will make Babylon a possession for the hedgehog,  
And pools of water,  
I will sweep her with the broom of destruction,’  
Says the Lord of armies.

And every one save his life from the fierce anger of the Lord.

## Jeremiah 51:21

“‘Lift up a standard on the walls of Babylon!  
Reinforce the guard,  
Place the lookout,  
Send the ambassadors,  
Do not stop!  
Advance the horses,  
Mount the steeds!  
Gather the mighty!

## Jeremiah 51:22

“‘Send out the archers!  
Hasten and set yourself against her all around;  
Do not let one escape!  
Repay her in accordance with her work;  
Do to her exactly as she has done.

“‘Cut off the breath of her outstretched arm;  
Let the Lord return her iniquity to her.

To the people of every quarter;  
I will give Babylon  
A plague of the heart, of sorrows, and of lamentations.

Who destroys all the earth,” says the Lord;  
“And I will stretch out My hand against you,  
And roll you down from the cliffs,  
And will make you a burnt mountain.

## Jeremiah 51:26

Then no stone will be taken  
From you for a memorial,  
Nor will you be raised up again,  
For I will make Babylon a desolation forever.”

## Jeremiah 51:27

Blow the trumpet among the peoples!  
Prepare the nations for battle against her!  
Summon against her the kingdoms, the Arameans, the Gebalites,  
The Ammonites, and the Moabites, against her,  
The people of whobbeth and Thammuz,  
Against her, the nations of all the face of the land.

## Jeremiah 51:28

“‘Yes, gather together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz;  
Appoint an archers against her;  
Give the command to destroy her!  
Send the horses, set them in motion!  
Go up, warriors, and wrap yourselves with your shame!

## Jeremiah 51:29

“‘The Lord has raised a spirit of the kings of the Medes;  
Out of a distant land they have come, and I will make them move against her;  
No one will regard silver, nor delight in gold.

They will have no mercy on the fruit of the womb;  
Their eye will not pity children.

A prey and a dilemma to the nations.

Like locusts, and they will lift up a shout of battle  
Against you.

As one who lifts up a threatening battle cry on the mountains;  
Because the Lord has taken you  
And troubled you with the sound of your arrow.

And all her warriors will be destroyed on that day,’  
Declares the Lord.

Declares the Lord God of armies,  
“For your day has come, the time when I will punish you.

With no one to raise him up,  
And I will set fire to his cities,  
And they will be burned.

All who bend the bow, shoot at her;  
Do not spare your arrows!  
For she has sinned against the Lord.

And they will drive her away like the tempest.

## Jeremiah 51:44

High gates and bronze bars will be smashed!  
The king and princes will sit there in shame;  
They will shut themselves in and climb the walls,  
But I will kindle a fire in their chins,  
And it will consume them.”

Listen, and your life will be preserved.

## Jeremiah 51:47

Behold, I am going to stir up and bring against Babylon  
An assembly of great nations from the land of the north—

## Jeremiah 51:48

They will set their camp against her;  
They will have wall and ramp, and shoot at her with arrows from the ground.

## Jeremiah 51:49

They will raise a siege ramp,  
They will build a wall,  
They will go in through her gates,  
Like men breaking into a city.

## Jeremiah 51:50

But they will be captured, their arrow will not be turned back,  
And the bowstring will be broken,  
For the Lord is a God of recompense;  
He will repay in full.

## Jeremiah 51:51

“‘Behold, I am stirring up against them  
The Medes, who have no regard for silver;  
As for gold, they have no delight in it.

A dry land and a wilderness,  
A land in which no man lives or passes through.

For all their evil which they have done in Zion in your sight,’  
Declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 51:55

You who have escaped the sword of the Chaldeans,  
Set sail away to inhabit them,  
And bury in the earth your garment,  
Hide it from the face of the oppressor.

## Jeremiah 51:56

For the Lord has appointed a day  
Of vengeance—He has indignation on Babylon;  
And the power of her slain will fall in the midst of her.

## Jeremiah 51:57

And all the earth will quake at the sound of her fall,  
At the sound of a cry, at the sound of a roar;  
“For her voice has sounded like the sea;  
For she has spoken like the dragon,  
Shouting against Zion,  
Hurling threats, fiercely raising her voice.

## Jeremiah 51:58

Therefore the slain of the Lord will fall in that day  
From one end of the earth even to the other;  
They will not be lamented,  
Nor gathered, Nor buried;  
They will be dung on the ground.

## Jeremiah 51:59

“Moreover, the word that Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign was:

## Jeremiah 51:60

For thus said the Lord to Jeremiah: ‘Take a large scroll and write on it all the words that I have spoken against Babylon and against all the nations, from the day I first spoke concerning them, even to this day.’

## Jeremiah 51:61

Moreover, tie a stone to it and throw it into the Euphrates River,

## Jeremiah 51:62

and say, “Thus Babylon will sink and not rise again, because of the disaster which I am bringing on her.  
And if they ask you, ‘Why have you done so?’ then you shall say to them, ‘Because the Lord has spoken and promised to do these things.’

## Jeremiah 51:63

“And when you finish reading this scroll, tie a stone to it and throw it into the Euphrates River,

## Jeremiah 51:64

and say, ‘Thus Babylon will sink and not rise again  
Because of the disaster which I am bringing on her,’”

Declares the Lord.
