# Malachi Chapter 2

## Malachi 2:1
“And now, this admonition is for you, priests.

## Malachi 2:2
If you do not listen, and if you do not take it to heart to honour my name,” says the Lord of Hosts, “I will send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings. Indeed, I have already cursed them, because you are not taking it to heart.

## Malachi 2:3
Behold, I will rebuke your descendants, and I will spread dung on your faces, the dung of your festival sacrifices, and you will be carried away with it.

## Malachi 2:4
Then you will know that I have sent you this command so that my covenant with Levi may continue,” says the Lord of Hosts.

## Malachi 2:5
“My covenant with him was one of life and peace, and I gave them to him as an object of reverence; so he revered me and stood in awe of my name.

## Malachi 2:6
True instruction was in his mouth, and no injustice was found on his lips. He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and turned many from wrongdoing.

## Malachi 2:7
For the lips of a priest should preserve knowledge, and people should seek instruction from his mouth, for he is the messenger of the Lord of Hosts.

## Malachi 2:8
But you have turned aside from the way and by your instruction have caused many to stumble; you have violated the covenant with Levi,” says the Lord of Hosts.

## Malachi 2:9
“So I have made you despised and humiliated before all the people, because you have not kept my ways but have shown partiality in matters of the law.”

## Malachi 2:10
Do we not all have one Father? Did not one God create us? Why do we deal treacherously with one another, profaning the covenant of our ancestors?

## Malachi 2:11
Judah has been unfaithful, and an abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem: Judah has desecrated the sanctuary the Lord loves by marrying the daughter of a foreign god.

## Malachi 2:12
As for the man who does this, may the Lord remove him from the tents of Jacob—even though he brings an offering to the Lord of Hosts.

## Malachi 2:13
And this is another thing you do: you flood the Lord’s altar with tears, weeping and wailing because he no longer regards your offerings or accepts them with favour from your hands.

## Malachi 2:14
You ask, “Why?” It is because the Lord is a witness between you and the wife of your youth. You have been unfaithful to her, though she is your partner, the wife of your marriage covenant.

## Malachi 2:15
Has not the one God made you? You belong to him in body and spirit. And what does the one God seek? Godly offspring. So be on your guard, and do not be unfaithful to the wife of your youth.

## Malachi 2:16
“For I hate divorce,” says the Lord, the God of Israel, “and the one who covers his garment with violence,” says the Lord of Hosts. So be on your guard, and do not be unfaithful.

## Malachi 2:17
You have wearied the Lord with your words. Yet you say, “How have we wearied him?” By saying, “All who do evil are good in the sight of the Lord, and he is pleased with them,” or, “Where is the God of justice?”
