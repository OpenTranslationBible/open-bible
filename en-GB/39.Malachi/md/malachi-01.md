## Malachi 1:1
The message of the Lord's word to Israel through Malachi:

## Malachi 1:2
“I have loved you,” says the Lord. But you question, “How have you loved us?” “Was Esau not Jacob’s brother?” declares the Lord. “Yet I have loved Jacob;

## Malachi 1:3
but Esau I have hated, and I have made his mountains a desolation and given his inheritance to the jackals of the wilderness.”

## Malachi 1:4
Edom may say, “We have been beaten down, but we will return and build the ruins.” But this is what the Lord of hosts says: “They may build, but I will tear down. They will be called the territory of wickedness, and the people with whom the Lord is indignant forever.”

## Malachi 1:5
Your eyes will see this, and you will say, “Great is the Lord—even beyond the borders of Israel!”

## Malachi 1:6
“A son honours his father, and a servant his master. If I am a father, where is my honour? And if I am a master, where is my respect?” says the Lord of hosts to you, the priests who despise my name. But you ask, “How have we despised your name?”

## Malachi 1:7
By presenting defiled food on my altar. But you ask, “How have we defiled you?” By saying, “The table of the Lord is contemptible.”

## Malachi 1:8
When you offer blind animals for sacrifice, is that not wrong? Or when you present lame or sick animals, is that not wrong? Try offering them to your governor! Would he be pleased with you? Would he accept you?” says the Lord of hosts.

## Malachi 1:9
“But now, plead for God’s favour, so that he will be gracious to us. With such offerings from your hands, will he accept any of you?” says the Lord of hosts.

## Malachi 1:10
“If only one of you would shut the temple doors, so that you would not kindle fire on my altar for nothing! I am not pleased with you,” says the Lord of hosts, “nor will I accept an offering from your hand.

## Malachi 1:11
For from the rising of the sun to its setting, my name will be great among the nations, and in every place incense and pure offerings will be brought to my name, for my name will be great among the nations,” says the Lord of hosts.

## Malachi 1:12
“But you are profaning it by saying, ‘The table of the Lord is defiled, and its food is contemptible.’

## Malachi 1:13
And you say, ‘What a burden!’ and you sniff at it contemptuously,” says the Lord of hosts. “When you bring what is taken by robbery, or lame or sick animals, and offer them as sacrifices, should I accept them from your hand?” says the Lord.

## Malachi 1:14
“But cursed is the deceiver who has an acceptable male in his flock and vows to give it, but then sacrifices a blemished animal to the Lord. For I am a great king,” says the Lord of hosts, “and my name is to be feared among the nations.”
