# Lamentations Chapter 3

## Lamentations 3:1

I am the man who has witnessed affliction under the rod of His wrath.

## Lamentations 3:2

He has driven me away and made me walk in darkness, not light;

## Lamentations 3:3

Indeed, He has turned His hand against me repeatedly throughout the day.

## Lamentations 3:4

He has caused my skin and my flesh to age, and has shattered my bones.

## Lamentations 3:5

He has besieged me and encircled me with bitterness and hardship.

## Lamentations 3:6

He has made me dwell in darkness, like those long deceased.

## Lamentations 3:7

He has walled me in so I cannot escape; He has burdened me with chains.

## Lamentations 3:8

Even when I cry out and call for help, my prayer is not heard.

## Lamentations 3:9

He has obstructed my way with blocks of stone; He has twisted my paths.

## Lamentations 3:10

He is like a bear lying in wait, like a lion in hiding.

## Lamentations 3:11

He has led me off the path and torn me to pieces, leaving me desolate.

## Lamentations 3:12

He bent His bow and set me as the target for His arrows.

## Lamentations 3:13

He has pierced my heart with arrows from His quiver.

## Lamentations 3:14

I have become the laughingstock of all my people; they mock me in song all day long.

## Lamentations 3:15

He has filled me with bitterness and given me wormwood to drink.

## Lamentations 3:16

He has broken my teeth with gravel; He has pressed me into the dust.

## Lamentations 3:17

My soul is bereft of peace; I have forgotten what happiness is.

## Lamentations 3:18

So I say, “My splendour has perished, and so has my hope from the Lord.”

---

## Lamentations 3:19

Remember my affliction and my homelessness, the bitterness and the gall.

## Lamentations 3:20

My soul remembers them well and is downcast within me.

## Lamentations 3:21

Yet I recall this to mind, and therefore I have hope:

## Lamentations 3:22

The Lord’s mercies are indeed unending, for His compassions never fail.

## Lamentations 3:23

They are renewed every morning; Your faithfulness is great.

## Lamentations 3:24

“The Lord is my portion,” my soul declares, “therefore I will wait for Him.”

## Lamentations 3:25

The Lord shows goodness to those who place their hope in Him, to the person who seeks Him.

## Lamentations 3:26

It is beneficial to wait quietly for the Lord's salvation.

## Lamentations 3:27

It is advantageous for a man to bear the yoke in his youth.

## Lamentations 3:28

Let him sit alone in silence, for the Lord has laid it upon him.

## Lamentations 3:29

Let him bury his face in the dust—perhaps there is hope.

## Lamentations 3:30

Let him offer his cheek to the one who strikes him, and let him be filled with disgrace.

## Lamentations 3:31

For the Lord will not reject forever.

## Lamentations 3:32

Though He causes grief, He will show compassion, according to His abundant mercy.

## Lamentations 3:33

For He does not bring affliction or grief willingly to the children of men.

## Lamentations 3:34

To crush underfoot all the prisoners of the land,

## Lamentations 3:35

To deny a person justice before the Most High,

## Lamentations 3:36

To defraud someone in their lawsuit—these things the Lord does not approve.

## Lamentations 3:37

Who can speak and have it happen unless the Lord has commanded it?

## Lamentations 3:38

Does not both adversity and good come from the mouth of the Most High?

## Lamentations 3:39

Why should any living person complain when punished for their sins?

## Lamentations 3:40

Let us examine and test our ways, and let us return to the Lord.

## Lamentations 3:41

Let us lift up our hearts and hands to God in heaven;

## Lamentations 3:42

We have sinned and rebelled, and You have withheld forgiveness.

## Lamentations 3:43

You have enveloped Yourself with anger and pursued us; You have slain without mercy.

## Lamentations 3:44

You have hidden Yourself with a cloud so that no prayer can pass through.

## Lamentations 3:45

You have made us scum and refuse among the peoples.

## Lamentations 3:46

All our enemies have spoken against us with open mouths.

## Lamentations 3:47

We have encountered panic and pitfalls, devastation and destruction.

## Lamentations 3:48

Streams of tears flow from my eyes because of the destruction of the daughter of my people.

## Lamentations 3:49

My eyes will flow unceasingly, without pause,

## Lamentations 3:50

Until the Lord looks down from heaven and sees.

## Lamentations 3:51

What I see brings grief to my soul because of all the daughters of my city.

## Lamentations 3:52

Those who were my enemies without cause pursued me like a bird.

## Lamentations 3:53

They tried to end my life in a pit and hurled stones at me;

## Lamentations 3:54

The waters closed over my head, and I thought I was cut off.

## Lamentations 3:55

I called upon Your name, Lord, from the depths of the pit.

## Lamentations 3:56

You heard my plea: “Do not turn a deaf ear to my cry for relief.”

## Lamentations 3:57

You drew near when I called upon You, and You reassured me, “Do not fear.”

## Lamentations 3:58

You, Lord, took up my case; You restored my life.

## Lamentations 3:59

Lord, You have seen the wrong done to me. Support my cause!

## Lamentations 3:60

You have observed all their vengeance, all their schemes against me.

## Lamentations 3:61

Lord, You have been aware of their insults, all their plots against me—

## Lamentations 3:62

The lips of my assailants and their whisperings are against me all day long.

## Lamentations 3:63

Observe their sitting and rising; I am their mocking song.

## Lamentations 3:64

Repay them, Lord, according to the work of their hands.

## Lamentations 3:65

Place a veil over their hearts, and may Your curse be upon them!

## Lamentations 3:66

Pursue them in anger and eliminate them from under the heavens of the Lord.
