# Lamentations Chapter 3

## Lamentations 3:1

I am the man who has seen affliction  
Because of the rod of His wrath.

## Lamentations 3:2

He has driven me and made me walk  
In darkness and not in light.

## Lamentations 3:3

Indeed, He has turned His hand against me  
Repeatedly all the day.

## Lamentations 3:4

He has worn away my flesh and my skin,  
He has broken my bones.

## Lamentations 3:5

He has besieged me and surrounded me  
With bitterness and hardship.

## Lamentations 3:6

He has made me live in dark places,  
Like those who have long been dead.

## Lamentations 3:7

He has walled me in so that I cannot go out;  
He has made my chain heavy.

## Lamentations 3:8

Even when I cry out and call for help,  
He shuts out my prayer.

## Lamentations 3:9

He has blocked my ways with cut stone;  
He has twisted my paths.

## Lamentations 3:10

He is to me like a bear lying in wait,  
Like a lion in hiding.

## Lamentations 3:11

He has turned aside my ways and torn me to pieces;  
He has made me desolate.

## Lamentations 3:12

He bent His bow  
And set me as a target for the arrow.

## Lamentations 3:13

He made the arrows of His quiver  
Enter my inward parts.

## Lamentations 3:14

I have become a laughingstock to all my people,  
Their song of ridicule all the day.

## Lamentations 3:15

He has filled me with bitterness,  
He has made me drunk with wormwood.

## Lamentations 3:16

He has broken my teeth with gravel;  
He has made me cower in the dust.

## Lamentations 3:17

My soul has been excluded from peace;  
I have forgotten happiness.

## Lamentations 3:18

So I say, “My strength has failed,  
And so has my hope from the Lord.”

---

## Lamentations 3:19

Remember my misery and my homelessness,  
The wormwood and bitterness.

## Lamentations 3:20

My soul certainly remembers,  
And is bent over within me.

## Lamentations 3:21

I recall this to my mind,  
Therefore I wait with hope.

## Lamentations 3:22

The Lord’s acts of mercy indeed do not end,  
For His compassions do not fail.

## Lamentations 3:23

They are new every morning;  
Great is Your faithfulness.

## Lamentations 3:24

“The Lord is my portion,” says my soul,  
“Therefore I wait for Him.”

## Lamentations 3:25

The Lord is good to those who wait for Him,  
To the person who seeks Him.

## Lamentations 3:26

It is good that he waits silently  
For the salvation of the Lord.

## Lamentations 3:27

It is good for a man  
That he should bear the yoke in his youth.

## Lamentations 3:28

Let him sit alone and keep quiet,  
Since He has laid it on him.

## Lamentations 3:29

Let him put his mouth in the dust,  
Perhaps there is hope.

## Lamentations 3:30

Let him give his cheek to the one who strikes him,  
Let him be filled with disgrace.

## Lamentations 3:31

For the Lord will not reject forever,

## Lamentations 3:32

For if He causes grief,  
Then He will have compassion  
In proportion to His abundant mercy.

## Lamentations 3:33

For He does not afflict  
Or grieve the children of men willingly.

## Lamentations 3:34

To crush underfoot  
All the prisoners of the land,

## Lamentations 3:35

To deprive a person of justice  
In the presence of the Most High,

## Lamentations 3:36

To defraud someone in his lawsuit—  
Of these things the Lord does not approve.

## Lamentations 3:37

Who is there who speaks and it comes to pass,  
Unless the Lord has commanded it?

## Lamentations 3:38

Is it not from the mouth of the Most High  
That both adversity and good proceed?

## Lamentations 3:39

Why should any living person complain,  
Any man, because of the punishment for his sins?

---

## Lamentations 3:40

Let’s examine and search out our ways,  
And return to the Lord.

## Lamentations 3:41

We raise our heart and hands  
Toward God in heaven;

## Lamentations 3:42

We have done wrong and rebelled;  
You have not forgiven.

## Lamentations 3:43

You have covered Yourself with anger  
And pursued us;  
You have slain and have not spared.

## Lamentations 3:44

You have veiled Yourself with a cloud  
So that no prayer can pass through.

## Lamentations 3:45

You have made us mere refuse and rubbish  
In the midst of the peoples.

## Lamentations 3:46

All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.

## Lamentations 3:47

Panic and pitfall have come upon us,  
Devastation and destruction;

## Lamentations 3:48

My eyes run down with streams of water  
Because of the destruction of the daughter of my people.

## Lamentations 3:49

My eyes pour down unceasingly,  
Without stopping,

## Lamentations 3:50

Until the Lord looks down  
And sees from heaven.

## Lamentations 3:51

My eyes bring pain to my soul  
Because of all the daughters of my city.

## Lamentations 3:52

My enemies without reason  
Hunted me down like a bird;

## Lamentations 3:53

They have silenced me in the pit  
And have placed a stone on me.

## Lamentations 3:54

Waters flowed over my head;  
I said, “I am cut off!”

## Lamentations 3:55

I called on Your name, Lord,  
Out of the lowest pit.

## Lamentations 3:56

You have heard my voice,  
“Do not hide Your ear from my plea for relief,  
From my cry for help.”

## Lamentations 3:57

You came near on the day I called to You;  
You said, “Do not fear!”

## Lamentations 3:58

Lord, You have pleaded my soul’s cause;  
You have redeemed my life.

## Lamentations 3:59

Lord, You have seen my oppression;  
Judge my case.

## Lamentations 3:60

You have seen all their vengeance,  
All their schemes against me.

## Lamentations 3:61

You have heard their reproach, Lord,  
All their schemes against me.

## Lamentations 3:62

The lips of those who rise up against me,  
And their whispering are against me all day long.

## Lamentations 3:63

Look at their sitting and their rising;  
I am their mocking song.

## Lamentations 3:64

You will repay them, Lord,  
In accordance with the work of their hands.

## Lamentations 3:65

You will give them dullness of heart,  
Your curse will be on them.

## Lamentations 3:66

You will pursue them in anger and eliminate them  
From under the heavens of the Lord!
