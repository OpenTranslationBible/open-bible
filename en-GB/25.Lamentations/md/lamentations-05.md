# Lamentations Chapter 5

## Lamentations 5:1

Remember, Lord, what has happened to us;  
Look, and see our disgrace!

## Lamentations 5:2

Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers,  
Our houses to foreigners.

## Lamentations 5:3

We have become orphans without a father,  
Our mothers are like widows.

## Lamentations 5:4

We have to pay for our drinking water,  
Our wood comes to us at a price.

## Lamentations 5:5

Our pursuers are at our necks;  
We are worn out, we are given no rest.

## Lamentations 5:6

We have submitted to Egypt and Assyria  
To get enough bread.

## Lamentations 5:7

Our fathers sinned, and are no more;  
It is we who have borne their punishment.

## Lamentations 5:8

Slaves rule over us;  
There is no one to rescue us from their hand.

## Lamentations 5:9

We get our bread at the risk of our lives  
Because of the sword in the wilderness.

## Lamentations 5:10

Our skin has become as hot as an oven  
Because of the burning heat of famine.

## Lamentations 5:11

They violated the women in Zion,  
The virgins in the cities of Judah.

## Lamentations 5:12

Leaders were hanged by their hands;  
Elders were not respected.

## Lamentations 5:13

Young men worked at the millstones,  
And youths staggered under loads of wood.

## Lamentations 5:14

Elders are gone from the gate,  
Young men from their music.

## Lamentations 5:15

The joy of our hearts has ended;  
Our dancing has been turned into mourning.

## Lamentations 5:16

The crown has fallen from our head;  
Woe to us, for we have sinned!

## Lamentations 5:17

Because of this our heart is faint,  
Because of these things our eyes are dim:

## Lamentations 5:18

Because of Mount Zion which lies desolate,  
Foxes prowl in it.

## Lamentations 5:19

You, Lord, rule forever;  
Your throne is from generation to generation.

## Lamentations 5:20

Why do You forget us forever?  
Why do You abandon us for so long?

## Lamentations 5:21

Restore us to You, Lord, so that we may return;  
Renew our days as of old,

## Lamentations 5:22

Unless You have utterly rejected us  
And are exceedingly angry with us.
