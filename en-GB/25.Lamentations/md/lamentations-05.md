# Lamentations Chapter 5

## Lamentations 5:1
Remember, O Lord, what has befallen us; observe, and behold our disgrace.

## Lamentations 5:2
Our inheritance has been given to strangers, our homes to foreigners.

## Lamentations 5:3
We have become like orphans, fatherless; our mothers are akin to widows.

## Lamentations 5:4
We must pay for the water we drink; our wood is obtained at a cost.

## Lamentations 5:5
Our pursuers are close behind us; we are exhausted and find no rest.

## Lamentations 5:6
We have submitted to Egypt and Assyria to secure enough bread.

## Lamentations 5:7
Our forefathers sinned and are no longer here, but we bear the consequences of their wrongs.

## Lamentations 5:8
Servants rule over us; there is no one to deliver us from their grasp.

## Lamentations 5:9
We obtain our bread at the peril of our lives due to the sword in the wilderness.

## Lamentations 5:10
Our skin is as hot as an oven, feverish from the ravages of hunger.

## Lamentations 5:11
Women have been violated in Zion, and maidens in the towns of Judah.

## Lamentations 5:12
Leaders have been hung by their hands; elders receive no respect.

## Lamentations 5:13
Young men labour at the millstones; boys stagger under burdens of wood.

## Lamentations 5:14
Elders are absent from the city gate; young men have ceased their music.

## Lamentations 5:15
The joy of our hearts has vanished; our dancing has turned into mourning.

## Lamentations 5:16
The crown has fallen from our head. Woe to us, for we have sinned!

## Lamentations 5:17
For this reason, our hearts are weak; and because of these events, our eyes grow dim;

## Lamentations 5:18
for Mount Zion is desolate, with wild animals roaming over it.

## Lamentations 5:19
You, O Lord, reign forever; your throne endures through all generations.

## Lamentations 5:20
Why do you forget us perpetually? Why do you forsake us for so long?

## Lamentations 5:21
Bring us back to you, O Lord, so we may return; renew our days as they once were,

## Lamentations 5:22
unless you have utterly rejected us and are exceedingly angry with us.
