# Lamentations Chapter 4

## Lamentations 4:1
How the gold has dimmed, how the pure gold has changed! The sacred stones are scattered at the corner of every street.

## Lamentations 4:2
The precious children of Zion, once valued as pure gold, are now regarded as earthenware pots, the work of a potter’s hands.

## Lamentations 4:3
Even jackals offer their breasts to nurse their young, but my people have become cruel like ostriches in the wilderness.

## Lamentations 4:4
The tongue of the infant clings to the roof of its mouth due to thirst; the children ask for bread, but no one gives it to them.

## Lamentations 4:5
Those who once feasted on delicacies now tremble in the streets; those nurtured in crimson now lie on ash heaps.

## Lamentations 4:6
The punishment of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom, which was overthrown in an instant without a hand turned to help her.

## Lamentations 4:7
Their princes were purer than snow, whiter than milk, more ruddy in body than rubies, their appearance like lapis lazuli.

## Lamentations 4:8
Now they are darker than soot; they are not recognised in the streets. Their skin has shrivelled on their bones; it has become as dry as wood.

## Lamentations 4:9
Better are those slain by the sword than those who die of hunger; they waste away, stricken by the lack of produce from the field.

## Lamentations 4:10
Compassionate women have boiled their own children; they became food for them during the destruction of my people.

## Lamentations 4:11
The Lord has exhausted His wrath, He has poured out His fierce anger. He kindled a fire in Zion that consumed its foundations.

## Lamentations 4:12
The kings of the earth did not believe, nor did any of the inhabitants of the world, that the adversary and the enemy could enter the gates of Jerusalem.

## Lamentations 4:13
This happened due to the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests, who shed the blood of the righteous within her.

## Lamentations 4:14
They wandered blindly in the streets; they were so defiled with blood that no one dared to touch their garments.

## Lamentations 4:15
“Away! Unclean!” people cried to them. “Away! Away! Do not touch us!” When they fled and wandered, people among the nations said, “They cannot stay here any longer.”

## Lamentations 4:16
The Lord Himself has scattered them; He no longer watches over them. The priests receive no honour, the elders no favour.

## Lamentations 4:17
Our eyes failed, looking in vain for help; from our watchtower we looked for a nation that could not save us.

## Lamentations 4:18
They hunted our steps so that we could not walk in our streets. Our end was near, our days were numbered, for our end had come.

## Lamentations 4:19
Our pursuers were swifter than eagles in the sky; they chased us over the mountains and lay in wait for us in the wilderness.

## Lamentations 4:20
The breath of our nostrils, the Lord’s anointed, was caught in their traps. We thought that under his shadow we would live among the nations.

## Lamentations 4:21
Rejoice and be glad, Daughter Edom, you who dwell in the land of Uz. But the cup will pass to you as well; you will become drunk and expose yourself.

## Lamentations 4:22
Your punishment is complete, Daughter Zion; He will not prolong your exile. But He will punish your sin, Daughter Edom, and expose your wickedness.
