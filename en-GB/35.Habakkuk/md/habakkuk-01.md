# Habakkuk Chapter 1

## Habakkuk 1:1

The oracle that the prophet Habakkuk witnessed.

## Habakkuk 1:2

> How long, O Lord, shall I cry for help, and you do not hear?
> I shout to you, “Violence!” but you do not save.

## Habakkuk 1:3

> Why do you cause me to witness wrongdoing,
> and why do you passively observe evil?
> Destruction and violence are before me;
> strife and contention arise.

## Habakkuk 1:4

> Therefore the law is ineffective,
> and justice never emerges.
> The wicked encircle the righteous,
> so justice is distorted.

## Habakkuk 1:5

> “Look among the nations,
> observe, and be astounded.
> For I am doing a work in your days
> that you would not believe if told.

## Habakkuk 1:6

> For behold, I am raising up the Babylonians,
> that fierce and impetuous nation,
> who march through the breadth of the earth
> to seize dwellings not their own.

## Habakkuk 1:7

> They are dreadful and fearsome;
> their justice and dignity proceed from themselves.

## Habakkuk 1:8

> Their horses are swifter than leopards,
> more fierce than the evening wolves.
> Their horsemen press on proudly;
> their horsemen come from afar.
> They fly like an eagle hastening to devour.

## Habakkuk 1:9

> They all come for violence,
> their faces set forward.
> They gather captives like sand.

## Habakkuk 1:10

> They scoff at kings
> and make princes a laughingstock.
> They laugh at every stronghold,
> for they heap up earth and take it.

## Habakkuk 1:11

> Then they sweep by like the wind and pass on.
> But they are guilty men,
> whose own might is their god.”

## Habakkuk 1:12

> Are you not eternal,
> O Lord my God, my Holy One?
> We shall not perish.
> O Lord, you have appointed them for judgement,
> and you, O Rock, have established them for correction.

## Habakkuk 1:13

> Your eyes are too pure to behold evil,
> and you cannot look on wrong with favour.
> Why do you regard those who deal treacherously?
> Why are you silent when the wicked swallow up
> those more righteous than they?

## Habakkuk 1:14

> You have made mankind like the fish of the sea,
> like creeping things that have no ruler.

## Habakkuk 1:15

> The foe brings all of them up with a hook,
> he drags them out with his net,
> he gathers them in his dragnet;
> so he rejoices and is glad.

## Habakkuk 1:16

> Therefore he offers sacrifices to his net
> and makes offerings to his dragnet;
> for by them he enjoys abundance,
> and his food is plentiful.

## Habakkuk 1:17

> Is he then to keep on emptying his net,
> and mercilessly slaying nations forever?
