> Revive them in our time,
> in our days make them known;
> in Your wrath remember mercy.

## Habakkuk 3:3

> God came from Teman,
> and the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah
> His glory covered the heavens,
> and His praise filled the earth.

## Habakkuk 3:4

> His radiance was like the sunlight;
> rays flashed from His hand,
> where His power was hidden.

## Habakkuk 3:5

> Plague went before Him,
> and pestilence followed His steps.

## Habakkuk 3:6

> He stood, and the earth shook;
> He looked, and the nations trembled.
> The everlasting mountains were shattered,
> the ancient hills collapsed.
> His paths are eternal.

## Habakkuk 3:7

> I saw the tents of Cushan in distress,
> and the tent curtains of Midian were trembling.

## Habakkuk 3:8

> Was the Lord angry with the rivers?
> Was Your wrath against the streams?
> Did You rage against the sea
> when You rode on Your horses
> and Your chariots of salvation?

## Habakkuk 3:9

> You uncovered Your bow,
> and called for many arrows.
> Selah You split the earth with rivers.

## Habakkuk 3:10

> The mountains saw You and writhed;
> torrents of water swept by.
> The deep raised its voice,
> and lifted its waves on high.

## Habakkuk 3:11

> Sun and moon stood still in their places
> at the light of Your flying arrows,
> at the brightness of Your flashing spear.

## Habakkuk 3:12

> In wrath You marched through the earth;
> in anger You threshed the nations.

## Habakkuk 3:13

> You went forth for the salvation of Your people,
> to save Your anointed one.
> You crushed the head of the house of wickedness,
> laying him bare from foot to neck. Selah

## Habakkuk 3:14

> With his own spear You pierced
> the head of his warriors.
> They stormed out to scatter us,
> gloating as if to devour the oppressed in secret.

## Habakkuk 3:15

> You trampled the sea with Your horses,
> churning the great waters.

## Habakkuk 3:16

> I heard, and my heart pounded;
> my lips quivered at the sound.
> Decay crept into my bones,
> and my legs trembled.
> Yet I will wait quietly for the day of distress
> to come upon the people who invade us.

## Habakkuk 3:17

> Though the fig tree does not blossom,
> and there are no grapes on the vines;
> though the olive crop fails,
> and the fields produce no food;
> though the flock disappears from the fold,
> and there are no cattle in the stalls,

## Habakkuk 3:18

> yet I will rejoice in the Lord,
> I will be joyful in God my Saviour.

## Habakkuk 3:19

> The Sovereign Lord is my strength;
> He makes my feet like the feet of a deer,
> and enables me to tread on the heights.
