> Lord, revive Your work in the midst of the years,  
> In the midst of the years make it known.  
> In anger remember mercy.

## Habakkuk 3:3

> God comes from Teman,  
> And the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah.  
> His splendour covers the heavens,  
> And the earth is full of His praise.

## Habakkuk 3:4

> His radiance is like the sunlight;  
> He has rays flashing from His hand,  
> And the hiding of His might is there.

## Habakkuk 3:5

> Before Him goes plague,  
> And plague comes forth after Him.

## Habakkuk 3:6

> He stood and caused the earth to shudder;  
> He looked and startled the nations.  
> Yes, the everlasting mountains were shattered,  
> The ancient hills collapsed.  
> His paths are everlasting.

## Habakkuk 3:7

> I saw the tents of Cushan under distress,  
> The tent curtains of the land of Midian were trembling.

## Habakkuk 3:8

> Did the Lord rage against the rivers,  
> Or was Your anger against the rivers,  
> Or was Your rage against the sea,  
> That You rode on Your horses,  
> On Your chariots of salvation?

## Habakkuk 3:9

> Your bow was uncovered,  
> The rods of discipline were sworn. Selah.  
> You split the earth with rivers.

## Habakkuk 3:10

> The mountains saw You and quaked;  
> The downpour of waters swept by.  
> The deep raised its voice,  
> It lifted high its hands.

## Habakkuk 3:11

> Sun and moon stood in their places;  
> They went away at the light of Your arrows,  
> At the radiance of Your flashing spear.

## Habakkuk 3:12

> In indignation You marched through the earth;  
> In anger You trampled the nations.

## Habakkuk 3:13

> You went forth for the salvation of Your people,  
> For the salvation of Your anointed.  
> You smashed the head of the house of evil  
> To uncover him from foot to neck. Selah.

## Habakkuk 3:14

> You pierced with his own arrows  
> The head of his leaders.  
> They stormed in to scatter us;  
> Their arrogance was like those  
> Who devour the oppressed in secret.

## Habakkuk 3:15

> You trampled on the sea with Your horses,  
> On the foam of many waters.

## Habakkuk 3:16

> I heard, and my inner parts trembled;  
> At the sound, my lips quivered.  
> Decay enters my bones,  
> And in my place I tremble.  
> Because I must wait quietly for the day of distress,  
> For the people to arise who will attack us.

## Habakkuk 3:17

> Even if the fig tree does not blossom,  
> And there is no fruit on the vines,  
> If the yield of the olive fails,  
> And the fields produce no food,  
> Even if the flock disappears from the fold,  
> And there are no cattle in the stalls,

## Habakkuk 3:18

> Yet I will triumph in the Lord,  
> I will rejoice in the God of my salvation.

## Habakkuk 3:19

> The Lord God is my strength,  
> And He has made my feet like deerâ€™s feet,  
> And has me walk on my high places.
