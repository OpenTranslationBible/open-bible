# Genesis Chapter 28

## Genesis 28:1
So Isaac summoned Jacob and blessed him, instructing him: “You must not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan.

## Genesis 28:2
Arise, go to Paddan Aram, to the house of Bethuel, your mother's father. From there, choose a wife from the daughters of Laban, your mother's brother.

## Genesis 28:3
May God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and multiply your numbers, so that you become a multitude of peoples.

## Genesis 28:4
May He grant you and your descendants the blessing of Abraham, enabling you to take possession of the land where you are residing as a foreigner, the land God gave to Abraham.”

## Genesis 28:5
Then Isaac sent Jacob away, and he journeyed to Paddan Aram, to Laban, son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.

## Genesis 28:6
Now Esau observed that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him to Paddan Aram to find a wife there, and that he had instructed him, “Do not marry a Canaanite woman,”

## Genesis 28:7
and that Jacob had listened to his father and mother and had gone to Paddan Aram.

## Genesis 28:8
Esau then understood how displeasing the Canaanite women were to his father Isaac;

## Genesis 28:9
so he went to Ishmael and married Mahalath, the sister of Nebaioth and daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, in addition to the wives he already had.

## Genesis 28:10
Jacob departed from Beersheba and set out towards Haran.

## Genesis 28:11
He reached a certain place and stayed there for the night, because the sun had set. He took one of the stones from that place, put it under his head, and lay down to sleep.

## Genesis 28:12
He dreamt of a ladder set upon the earth, with its top reaching to heaven, and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.

## Genesis 28:13
Above it stood the Lord, who said, “I am the Lord, the God of your father Abraham and the God of Isaac. I will give you and your descendants the land on which you are lying.

## Genesis 28:14
Your descendants will be like the dust of the earth, spreading out to the west, east, north, and south. All peoples on earth will be blessed through you and your offspring.

## Genesis 28:15
I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go, and I will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have fulfilled what I have promised you.”

## Genesis 28:16
Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, “Surely the Lord is in this place, and I was unaware of it.”

## Genesis 28:17
He was in awe and said, “How incredible is this place! This is none other than the house of God; this is the gate of heaven.”

## Genesis 28:18
Early the next morning, Jacob took the stone he had used as a pillow, set it up as a pillar, and poured oil on top of it.

## Genesis 28:19
He named that place Bethel, though previously the city was called Luz.

## Genesis 28:20
Then Jacob made a vow, saying, “If God will be with me and watch over me on this journey I am taking, and provide me with food to eat and clothes to wear,

## Genesis 28:21
so that I return safely to my father's home, then the Lord will be my God.

## Genesis 28:22
And this stone that I have set up as a pillar will be a house for God, and of all that you give me, I will give you a tenth.”
