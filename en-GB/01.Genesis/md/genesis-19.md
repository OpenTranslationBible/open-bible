# Genesis Chapter 19

## Genesis 19:1

The two angels arrived at Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting at the gate of the city. When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them and bowed with his face to the ground.

## Genesis 19:2

He said, “My lords, please turn aside to your servant’s house to spend the night and wash your feet. Then you may rise early and go on your way.” They said, “No, we will spend the night in the square.”

## Genesis 19:3

But Lot insisted strongly, so they turned aside to him and entered his house. He prepared a feast for them and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.

## Genesis 19:4

Before they lay down, the men of the city of Sodom, both young and old, surrounded the house, all the people from every quarter.

## Genesis 19:5

They called to Lot, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we may have relations with them.”

## Genesis 19:6

Lot went out to them at the doorway and shut the door behind him,

## Genesis 19:7

and said, “I beg you, my brothers, do not act so wickedly.

## Genesis 19:8

Look, I have two daughters who have not known a man. Please, let me bring them out to you, and you may do to them as you please. Only do nothing to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof.”

## Genesis 19:9

But they said, “Stand back!” They also said, “This fellow came here as a foreigner, and now he wants to play the judge! We will treat you worse than them.” They pressed hard against Lot and came near to break down the door.

## Genesis 19:10

But the men inside reached out their hands and pulled Lot back into the house, and shut the door.

## Genesis 19:11

Then they struck the men who were at the doorway of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they became weary trying to find the door.

## Genesis 19:12

The two men said to Lot, “Do you have anyone else here—sons-in-law, sons, daughters, or anyone else in the city who belongs to you? Get them out of this place,

## Genesis 19:13

for we are about to destroy this place, because the outcry against its people has become great before the Lord; the Lord has sent us to destroy it.”

## Genesis 19:14

So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were to marry his daughters, and said, “Get up, get out of this place, for the Lord is about to destroy the city.” But he appeared to his sons-in-law to be jesting.

## Genesis 19:15

When morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying, “Get up, take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away in the punishment of the city.”

## Genesis 19:16

But he hesitated, so the men seized his hand and the hands of his wife and his two daughters, because the Lord was merciful to him, and they brought him out and set him outside the city.

## Genesis 19:17

When they had brought them outside, one of them said, “Flee for your life! Do not look back or stop anywhere in the plain. Escape to the mountains or you will be swept away.”

## Genesis 19:18

But Lot said to them, “Please, my lords, not so!

## Genesis 19:19

Your servant has found favour in your sight, and you have shown great kindness to me by saving my life. But I cannot flee to the mountains, for the disaster will overtake me and I will die.

## Genesis 19:20

Look, here is a town near enough to flee to, and it is small. Please, let me escape there—is it not small?—so that my life may be spared.”

## Genesis 19:21

He replied to him, “I will also grant this request; I will not destroy the town you speak of.

## Genesis 19:22

But hurry, escape there, for I cannot do anything until you reach it.” Therefore the town was called Zoar.

## Genesis 19:23

Lot reached Zoar just as the sun rose over the land.

## Genesis 19:24

Then the Lord rained down brimstone and fire on Sodom and Gomorrah—from the Lord out of the heavens.

## Genesis 19:25

He overthrew those cities and all the plain, all the inhabitants of the cities, and what grew on the ground.

## Genesis 19:26

However, Lot’s wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.

## Genesis 19:27

Early in the morning, Abraham returned to the place where he had stood before the Lord.

## Genesis 19:28

He gazed down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, toward all the land of the plain, and he saw dense smoke rising from the land, like smoke from a furnace.

## Genesis 19:29

So it was that when God destroyed the cities of the plain, He remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when He overthrew the cities where Lot had lived.

## Genesis 19:30

Lot went up from Zoar and stayed in the mountains with his two daughters, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. He and his two daughters lived in a cave.

## Genesis 19:31

The firstborn said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is no man on earth to come to us according to the custom of all the earth.

## Genesis 19:32

Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve our family line through our father.”

## Genesis 19:33

Therefore, they gave their father wine to drink that night, and the firstborn went in and lay with her father; he was unaware of when she lay down or when she arose.

## Genesis 19:34

The next day, the firstborn said to the younger, “Look, I lay with my father last night; let us make him drink wine tonight also, and you go in and lie with him, that we may preserve our family line through our father.”

## Genesis 19:35

So they made their father drink wine that night also, and the younger arose and lay with him; he did not know when she lay down or when she arose.

## Genesis 19:36

Thus both of Lot’s daughters were with child by their father.

## Genesis 19:37

The firstborn bore a son and named him Moab; he is the father of the Moabites to this day.

## Genesis 19:38

The younger also bore a son and named him Ben-ammi; he is the father of the Ammonites to this day.
