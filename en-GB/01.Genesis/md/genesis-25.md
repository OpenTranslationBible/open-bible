# Genesis Chapter 25

## Genesis 25:1

Abraham took another wife, named Keturah.

## Genesis 25:2

She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.

## Genesis 25:3

Jokshan became the father of Sheba and Dedan. The descendants of Dedan were the Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim.

## Genesis 25:4

The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. These were all the descendants of Keturah.

## Genesis 25:5

Abraham gave all he possessed to Isaac.

## Genesis 25:6

But to the sons of his concubines, Abraham gave gifts while he was still alive, and sent them away from his son Isaac, eastward, to the land of the east.

## Genesis 25:7

The total years of Abraham’s life were 175 years.

## Genesis 25:8

Abraham breathed his last, dying at a ripe old age, an old man and full of years; and he was gathered to his people.

## Genesis 25:9

His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron, son of Zohar the Hittite, near Mamre,

## Genesis 25:10

the field Abraham had purchased from the sons of Heth. There Abraham was buried with his wife Sarah.

## Genesis 25:11

After Abraham’s death, God blessed his son Isaac, and Isaac settled near Beer-lahai-roi.

## Genesis 25:12

This is the account of the family line of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s maidservant, bore to Abraham.

## Genesis 25:13

These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, listed by their names in the order of their birth: Nebaioth, the firstborn of Ishmael, Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,

## Genesis 25:14

Mishma, Dumah, Massa,

## Genesis 25:15

Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.

## Genesis 25:16

These were the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names by their villages and encampments; twelve tribal leaders according to their clans.

## Genesis 25:17

Ishmael lived 137 years. He breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people.

## Genesis 25:18

His descendants settled from Havilah to Shur, which is east of Egypt as you go towards Assyria; and they lived in opposition to all their relatives.

## Genesis 25:19

This is the account of the family line of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham fathered Isaac,

## Genesis 25:20

and Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan-aram, and the sister of Laban the Aramean.

## Genesis 25:21

Isaac prayed to the Lord on behalf of his wife, because she was barren. The Lord answered his prayer, and his wife Rebekah conceived.

## Genesis 25:22

The children struggled together within her, and she said, “If it is so, why am I in this condition?” So she went to inquire of the Lord.

## Genesis 25:23

The Lord said to her, “Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples will be separated from your body; one people will be stronger than the other, and the elder will serve the younger.”

## Genesis 25:24

When the time came for her to give birth, she gave birth to twins.

## Genesis 25:25

The first came out red, all over like a hairy garment; and they named him Esau.

## Genesis 25:26

Afterwards, his brother came out, with his hand grasping Esau’s heel; so he was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she gave birth to them.

## Genesis 25:27

The boys grew up, and Esau became a skilful hunter, a man of the open country, while Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents.

## Genesis 25:28

Isaac loved Esau because he enjoyed eating his game, but Rebekah loved Jacob.

## Genesis 25:29

Once, when Jacob was cooking stew, Esau came in from the field, exhausted.

## Genesis 25:30

He said to Jacob, “Please let me have some of that red stew, for I am exhausted.” Therefore, he was called Edom.

## Genesis 25:31

Jacob said, “First sell me your birthright.”

## Genesis 25:32

Esau said, “I am at the point of death; what use is the birthright to me?”

## Genesis 25:33

Jacob said, “Swear to me first.” So he swore an oath to him, selling his birthright to Jacob.

## Genesis 25:34

Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew. He ate and drank, then got up and left. Thus Esau despised his birthright.
