# Genesis Chapter 31

## Genesis 31:1

Jacob heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying, “Jacob has taken away all that was our father’s, and from what belonged to our father he has gained all this wealth.”

## Genesis 31:2

And Jacob noticed that Laban’s attitude toward him was not as it had been before.

## Genesis 31:3

Then the Lord said to Jacob, “Return to the land of your fathers and your relatives, and I will be with you.”

## Genesis 31:4

So Jacob sent word and called Rachel and Leah to the field where his flocks were.

## Genesis 31:5

He said to them, “I see that your father’s attitude toward me is not as it was before, but the God of my father has been with me.

## Genesis 31:6

You know that I have served your father with all my strength.

## Genesis 31:7

Yet your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times, but God did not allow him to harm me.

## Genesis 31:8

If he said, ‘The speckled shall be your wages,’ then all the flock bore speckled; and if he said, ‘The striped shall be your wages,’ then all the flock bore striped.

## Genesis 31:9

So God has transferred your father’s livestock to me.

## Genesis 31:10

During breeding season, I had a dream in which I looked up and saw that the male goats mating with the flock were striped, speckled, or spotted.

## Genesis 31:11

The angel of God said to me in the dream, ‘Jacob,’ and I replied, ‘Here I am.’

## Genesis 31:12

He said, ‘Look up and see that all the male goats mating with the flock are striped, speckled, or spotted, for I have seen all that Laban has been doing to you.

## Genesis 31:13

I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and made a vow to me. Now arise, leave this land, and return to the land of your birth.’”

## Genesis 31:14

Rachel and Leah replied, “Do we still have any share in the inheritance of our father’s house?

## Genesis 31:15

Does he not regard us as foreigners? For he has sold us and used up what was paid for us.

## Genesis 31:16

Certainly, all the wealth that God has taken from our father belongs to us and our children. So do whatever God has told you.”

## Genesis 31:17

Then Jacob put his children and his wives on camels;

## Genesis 31:18

and he drove all his livestock and all his possessions that he had acquired in Paddan Aram, to go to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan.

## Genesis 31:19

While Laban had gone to shear his flock, Rachel took her father’s household gods.

## Genesis 31:20

Moreover, Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean by not telling him that he was fleeing.

## Genesis 31:21

So he fled with all he had, crossed the Euphrates River, and set out for the hill country of Gilead.

## Genesis 31:22

On the third day, Laban was informed that Jacob had fled.

## Genesis 31:23

Taking his kinsmen with him, he pursued Jacob for seven days and caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead.

## Genesis 31:24

But God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night and said, “Be careful not to speak to Jacob either good or bad.”

## Genesis 31:25

Laban caught up with Jacob. Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban and his kinsmen camped there too.

## Genesis 31:26

Then Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done by deceiving me and taking my daughters away like captives?

## Genesis 31:27

Why did you run off secretly and deceive me? Why didn’t you tell me, so I could have sent you away with joy and songs, with tambourine and lyre?

## Genesis 31:28

You didn’t even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters goodbye. You have acted unwisely.

## Genesis 31:29

I have the power to harm you; but last night the God of your father said to me, ‘Be careful not to speak to Jacob either good or bad.’

## Genesis 31:30

Now you have gone off because you longed to return to your father’s house. But why did you take my gods?”

## Genesis 31:31

Jacob answered Laban, “I was afraid, because I thought you might take your daughters from me by force.

## Genesis 31:32

But if you find anyone who has your gods, that person shall not live. In the presence of our relatives, see for yourself whether there is anything of yours here with me; and if so, take it.” Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had taken the gods.

## Genesis 31:33

So Laban went into Jacob’s tent, and into Leah’s tent, and into the tent of the two female servants, but he did not find them. After he came out of Leah’s tent, he entered Rachel’s tent.

## Genesis 31:34

Now Rachel had taken the household gods and placed them inside her camel’s saddle and was sitting on them. Laban searched through everything in the tent but found nothing.

## Genesis 31:35

Rachel said to her father, “Do not be angry, my lord, that I cannot stand up in your presence; I am having my period.” So he searched but did not find the household gods.

## Genesis 31:36

Jacob was angry and took Laban to task. “What is my crime?” he asked Laban. “What is my sin that you have hotly pursued me?

## Genesis 31:37

Now that you have searched through all my goods, what have you found that belongs to your household? Place it here in front of our relatives and let them judge between us.

## Genesis 31:38

“I have been with you for twenty years now. Your ewes and your female goats have not miscarried, nor have I eaten the rams of your flocks.

## Genesis 31:39

I did not bring you animals torn by wild beasts; I bore the loss myself. And you required payment from me for whatever was stolen by day or night.

## Genesis 31:40

This was my situation: The heat consumed me in the daytime and the frost at night, and sleep fled from my eyes.

## Genesis 31:41

For twenty years I was in your household. I laboured for you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks, and you altered my wages ten times.

## Genesis 31:42

If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the One whom Isaac feared, had not been with me, you would surely have sent me away empty-handed. But God has seen my hardship and the toil of my hands, and last night he rebuked you.”

## Genesis 31:43

Laban replied to Jacob, “The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks. All you see is mine. Yet what can I do today about these daughters of mine, or about the children they have borne?

## Genesis 31:44

Come now, let us make a covenant, you and I, and let it serve as a witness between us.”

## Genesis 31:45

So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar.

## Genesis 31:46

He said to his relatives, “Gather some stones.” So they took stones and made a heap, and they ate there by the heap.

## Genesis 31:47

Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, and Jacob called it Galeed.

## Genesis 31:48

Laban said, “This heap serves as a witness between you and me today.” That is why it was called Galeed.

## Genesis 31:49

It was also called Mizpah, because he said, “May the Lord watch over us when we are apart from each other.

## Genesis 31:50

If you mistreat my daughters or if you take any wives besides my daughters, even though no one is with us, remember that God is a witness between you and me.”

## Genesis 31:51

Laban also said to Jacob, “Here is this heap, and here is this pillar I have set up between you and me.

## Genesis 31:52

This heap is a witness, and this pillar is a witness, that I will not pass by this heap to your side to harm you and that you will not pass by this heap and pillar to my side to harm me.

## Genesis 31:53

May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.” So Jacob swore by the One whom his father Isaac feared.

## Genesis 31:54

He made an offering there in the hill country and invited his relatives to a meal. After they had eaten, they spent the night there.

## Genesis 31:55

Early the next morning Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them. Then he left and returned home.
