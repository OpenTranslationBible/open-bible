# Genesis Chapter 22

## Genesis 22:1
After these events, God tested Abraham and said to him, “Abraham!” And he replied, “Here I am.”

## Genesis 22:2
God said, “Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah. Offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains I will show you.”

## Genesis 22:3
Abraham rose early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, along with his son Isaac; he cut wood for the burnt offering and set out for the place God had told him about.

## Genesis 22:4
On the third day, Abraham lifted his eyes and saw the place from afar.

## Genesis 22:5
Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey while the boy and I go over there. We will worship and then return to you.”

## Genesis 22:6
Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and placed it on Isaac, his son, while he himself carried the fire and the knife. The two of them walked on together.

## Genesis 22:7
Isaac spoke to Abraham, his father, and said, “Father?” And he replied, “Yes, my son?” Isaac said, “Here are the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?”

## Genesis 22:8
Abraham said, “God will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.” So the two of them continued on together.

## Genesis 22:9
When they arrived at the place God had indicated, Abraham built an altar there, arranged the wood, and bound his son Isaac, laying him on the altar atop the wood.

## Genesis 22:10
Abraham then reached out his hand and took the knife to slay his son.

## Genesis 22:11
But the angel of the Lord called out to him from heaven, “Abraham, Abraham!” And he replied, “Here I am.”

## Genesis 22:12
The angel said, “Do not lay your hand on the boy or do anything to him; now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.”

## Genesis 22:13
Abraham looked up and saw a ram caught by its horns in a thicket. He went and took the ram and offered it as a burnt offering instead of his son.

## Genesis 22:14
Abraham named that place The Lord Will Provide. To this day it is said, “On the mountain of the Lord it will be provided.”

## Genesis 22:15
The angel of the Lord called to Abraham from heaven a second time

## Genesis 22:16
and said, “By myself I have sworn, declares the Lord, because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son,

## Genesis 22:17
I will surely bless you and greatly multiply your descendants like the stars of the heavens and the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will possess the gates of their enemies,

## Genesis 22:18
and through your offspring all nations of the earth will be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice.”

## Genesis 22:19
Then Abraham returned to his young men, and they set off together for Beersheba, where Abraham settled.

## Genesis 22:20
After these things, Abraham was informed, “Milcah has also borne children to your brother Nahor:

## Genesis 22:21
Uz the firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel, the father of Aram,

## Genesis 22:22
Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.”

## Genesis 22:23
Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. Milcah bore these eight sons to Nahor, Abraham’s brother.

## Genesis 22:24
His concubine, named Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.
