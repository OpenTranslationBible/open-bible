# Genesis Chapter 45

## Genesis 45:1
Then Joseph could no longer restrain himself before all those standing by him, and he called out, “Have everyone leave me!” So there was no one with Joseph when he revealed himself to his brothers.

## Genesis 45:2
He wept so loudly that the Egyptians heard it, and the news reached Pharaoh’s household.

## Genesis 45:3
Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph! Is my father still alive?” But his brothers were unable to answer him, for they were terrified in his presence.

## Genesis 45:4
Then Joseph said to his brothers, “Please come closer to me.” When they had approached, he said, “I am your brother Joseph, whom you sold into Egypt.

## Genesis 45:5
Now, do not be distressed or angry with yourselves for selling me here, because God sent me ahead of you to preserve life.

## Genesis 45:6
For the famine has been in the land for two years, and there are still five years in which there will be no ploughing or harvesting.

## Genesis 45:7
God sent me ahead of you to ensure a remnant on earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance.

## Genesis 45:8
So it was not you who sent me here, but God. He has made me a father to Pharaoh, lord of all his household, and ruler over all Egypt.

## Genesis 45:9
Hurry back to my father and say to him, ‘This is what your son Joseph says: God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me; do not delay.

## Genesis 45:10
You shall live in the land of Goshen and be near me—you, your children and grandchildren, your flocks and herds, and all that you have.

## Genesis 45:11
I will provide for you there, for there are still five years of famine to come, lest you and your household and all you have become destitute.’

## Genesis 45:12
Behold, your eyes and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see that it is I who am speaking to you.

## Genesis 45:13
Tell my father about all my honour in Egypt and about everything you have seen. And bring my father down here quickly.”

## Genesis 45:14
Then he embraced his brother Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin wept on his shoulder.

## Genesis 45:15
He kissed all his brothers and wept over them. Afterwards, his brothers talked with him.

## Genesis 45:16
When the news reached Pharaoh’s house that Joseph’s brothers had come, it pleased Pharaoh and his servants.

## Genesis 45:17
Pharaoh instructed Joseph, “Tell your brothers, ‘Here is what you should do: Load your animals and return to the land of Canaan,

## Genesis 45:18
and bring your father and your households back to me. I will give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you shall enjoy the fat of the land.’

## Genesis 45:19
You are also instructed, ‘Do this: Take some wagons from Egypt for your little ones and your wives, and bring your father and come.

## Genesis 45:20
Do not worry about your belongings, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.’”

## Genesis 45:21
The sons of Israel did so. Joseph gave them wagons, as Pharaoh had commanded, and also provided them with provisions for the journey.

## Genesis 45:22
He gave each of them changes of garments, but to Benjamin, he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of garments.

## Genesis 45:23
To his father he sent the following: ten donkeys loaded with the best things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain, bread, and provisions for the journey.

## Genesis 45:24
He sent his brothers away, and as they departed, he said to them, “Do not quarrel on the way!”

## Genesis 45:25
They went up from Egypt and came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan.

## Genesis 45:26
They told him, “Joseph is still alive, and indeed he is ruler over all Egypt.” Jacob was stunned, for he did not believe them.

## Genesis 45:27
But when they recounted to him all the words Joseph had spoken to them, and when he saw the wagons Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of their father Jacob revived.

## Genesis 45:28
Then Israel declared, “This is enough; my son Joseph is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.”
