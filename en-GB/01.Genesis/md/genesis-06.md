# Genesis Chapter 6

## Genesis 6:1

When mankind began to multiply on the surface of the earth, they had daughters born to them,

## Genesis 6:2

the sons of God saw that the daughters of mankind were beautiful, so they took as wives any they chose.

## Genesis 6:3

Then the Lord declared, “My Spirit shall not strive with humans indefinitely, for they are flesh; their lifespan shall be 120 years.”

## Genesis 6:4

The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterwards, when the sons of God went to the daughters of humans and had children by them. These were the mighty men of old, men of renown.

## Genesis 6:5

The Lord saw that the wickedness of humankind was great on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of their hearts was only evil continually.

## Genesis 6:6

The Lord regretted that He had made humankind on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart.

## Genesis 6:7

So the Lord said, “I will wipe out humankind whom I have created from the face of the earth, along with the animals, the birds, and the creatures that move on the ground, for I regret that I have made them.”

## Genesis 6:8

However, Noah was favoured by the Lord.

## Genesis 6:9

This is the account of Noah and his family. Noah was a righteous man, blameless among his contemporaries, and he walked with God.

## Genesis 6:10

Noah was the father of three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

## Genesis 6:11

Now the earth was corrupt in God’s sight and filled with violence.

## Genesis 6:12

God looked upon the earth and saw that it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth.

## Genesis 6:13

Then God said to Noah, “The end of all flesh has come before Me, for the earth is filled with violence through them; behold, I am about to destroy them along with the earth.

## Genesis 6:14

Make yourself an ark of gopher wood; create compartments in the ark and coat it with pitch inside and out.

## Genesis 6:15

This is how you are to construct it: the ark is to be three hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high.

## Genesis 6:16

Construct a roof for the ark, finishing it to a cubit from the top; place a door on the side of the ark, and make lower, middle, and upper decks.

## Genesis 6:17

Behold, I am bringing floodwaters upon the earth to destroy all flesh in which there is the breath of life under heaven; everything on the earth shall perish.

## Genesis 6:18

Yet, I will establish My covenant with you, and you shall enter the ark—you, your sons, your wife, and your sons’ wives with you.

## Genesis 6:19

You are to bring into the ark two of every kind of living creature, male and female, to keep them alive with you.

## Genesis 6:20

Of the birds according to their kinds, of the animals according to their kinds, and of every creature that moves along the ground according to its kind, two of every kind will come to you to be kept alive.

## Genesis 6:21

You are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten and store it away as provisions for you and for them.”

## Genesis 6:22

Noah carried out everything just as God commanded.
