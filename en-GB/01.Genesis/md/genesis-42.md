# Genesis Chapter 42

## Genesis 42:1

When Jacob realised there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, “Why are you just looking at each other?”

## Genesis 42:2

He added, “I have heard there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us, so that we may live and not die.”

## Genesis 42:3

So ten of Joseph’s brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.

## Genesis 42:4

However, Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, with the others, for he feared harm might come to him.

## Genesis 42:5

Thus, the sons of Israel were among those who went to buy grain, for the famine was also in the land of Canaan.

## Genesis 42:6

Joseph was the governor of the land, the one who sold grain to all its people. When Joseph’s brothers arrived, they bowed down to him with their faces to the ground.

## Genesis 42:7

Upon seeing his brothers, Joseph recognised them, but he disguised himself and spoke harshly to them. “Where do you come from?” he asked. “From the land of Canaan,” they replied, “to buy food.”

## Genesis 42:8

Joseph knew his brothers, but they did not recognise him.

## Genesis 42:9

Joseph remembered the dreams he had about them and said, “You are spies! You have come to see where our land is unprotected.”

## Genesis 42:10

They responded, “No, my lord. We, your servants, have come to buy food.

## Genesis 42:11

We are all sons of one man. We are honest men, not spies.”

## Genesis 42:12

But he insisted, “No, you have come to see where our land is unprotected.”

## Genesis 42:13

They replied, “Your servants are twelve brothers, sons of one man in Canaan. The youngest is with our father, and one is no more.”

## Genesis 42:14

Joseph said to them, “It is as I warned: you are spies!

## Genesis 42:15

This is how you will be tested: by the life of Pharaoh, you shall not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here.

## Genesis 42:16

Send one of your number to get your brother; the rest of you will remain confined, so that your words may be tested to see if you are telling the truth. Otherwise, by the life of Pharaoh, you are spies!”

## Genesis 42:17

And he had them all held in custody for three days.

## Genesis 42:18

On the third day, Joseph said to them, “Do this and you will live, for I fear God:

## Genesis 42:19

If you are honest men, let one of your brothers stay here imprisoned, while the rest of you go and take grain back for your hungry households.

## Genesis 42:20

But you must bring your youngest brother to me, so that your words may be verified and you will not die.” And they agreed to do so.

## Genesis 42:21

They said to one another, “Surely we are being punished because of our brother. We saw his distress when he pleaded with us, but we would not listen; that is why this trouble has come upon us.”

## Genesis 42:22

Reuben responded, “Did I not tell you not to sin against the boy? But you would not listen! Now justice for his blood is required.”

## Genesis 42:23

They were unaware that Joseph could understand them, since he was using an interpreter.

## Genesis 42:24

Joseph turned away from them and wept, but then returned and spoke to them again. He took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes.

## Genesis 42:25

Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain, to put each man’s silver back in his sack, and to provide them with provisions for their journey. This was done for them.

## Genesis 42:26

They loaded their grain onto their donkeys and set out.

## Genesis 42:27

At the place where they stopped for the night, one of them opened his sack to feed his donkey, and he saw his silver in the mouth of his sack.

## Genesis 42:28

“My silver has been returned,” he said to his brothers. “Here it is in my sack.” Their hearts sank, and they turned to each other trembling, saying, “What is this that God has done to us?”

## Genesis 42:29

When they returned to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them, saying,

## Genesis 42:30

“The man who is lord over the land spoke harshly to us and treated us as though we were spies of the country.

## Genesis 42:31

But we said to him, ‘We are honest men; we are not spies.

## Genesis 42:32

We are twelve brothers, sons of one father. One is no more, and the youngest is with our father in Canaan.’

## Genesis 42:33

Then the man who is lord over the land said to us, ‘This is how I will know whether you are honest men: leave one of your brothers here with me, take grain for your starving households, and go.

## Genesis 42:34

But bring your youngest brother to me so that I will know you are not spies but honest men. Then I will give your brother back to you, and you may trade in the land.’”

## Genesis 42:35

As they were emptying their sacks, each man’s pouch of silver was in his sack. When they and their father saw the money pouches, they were afraid.

## Genesis 42:36

Their father Jacob said to them, “You have deprived me of my children. Joseph is no more, Simeon is no more, and now you want to take Benjamin. Everything is against me!”

## Genesis 42:37

Reuben said to his father, “You may put my two sons to death if I do not bring him back to you. Entrust him to my care, and I will return him to you.”

## Genesis 42:38

But Jacob said, “My son shall not go down with you; his brother is dead, and he alone is left. If harm should happen to him on the journey you are taking, you will bring my grey hair down to Sheol in sorrow.”
