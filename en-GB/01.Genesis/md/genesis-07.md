Take with you seven pairs of every kind of clean animal, a male and its female; and one pair of every kind of unclean animal, a male and its female;

## Genesis 7:3
and also seven pairs of every kind of bird, male and female, to keep their offspring alive across the face of the earth.

For in seven days, I will send rain upon the earth for forty days and forty nights, and I will wipe from the face of the land every living thing that I have made.”

In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, on the seventeenth day of the second month, on that day all the springs of the great deep burst forth, and the floodgates of the sky were opened.

## Genesis 7:12
And rain poured down upon the earth for forty days and forty nights.

All life on dry land that had the breath of life in its nostrils died.

The waters prevailed upon the earth for one hundred and fifty days.
