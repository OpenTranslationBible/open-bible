# Genesis Chapter 50

## Genesis 50:1
Joseph fell upon his father's face, weeping over him and kissing him.

## Genesis 50:2
Joseph instructed the physicians in his service to embalm his father Israel. So the physicians embalmed him.

## Genesis 50:3
The embalming took forty days, as that was the customary period required. The Egyptians mourned for him seventy days.

## Genesis 50:4
When the days of mourning were completed, Joseph spoke to Pharaoh’s household, saying, “If I have found favour in your eyes, please speak to Pharaoh on my behalf, saying,

## Genesis 50:5
‘My father made me swear an oath, saying, “Behold, I am about to die; in the grave I prepared for myself in the land of Canaan, you shall bury me there.” Now let me go up and bury my father; then I will return.’”

## Genesis 50:6
Pharaoh replied, “Go and bury your father, as he made you swear.”

## Genesis 50:7
So Joseph went up to bury his father. With him went all of Pharaoh’s officials, the elders of his household, and all the elders of Egypt,

## Genesis 50:8
along with all of Joseph’s household, his brothers, and his father’s household. Only their children, flocks, and herds were left in Goshen.

## Genesis 50:9
Chariots and horsemen also accompanied him. It was a very large company.

## Genesis 50:10
When they reached the threshing floor of Atad, beyond the Jordan, they mourned with a very great and sorrowful lamentation; Joseph observed a seven-day mourning period for his father.

## Genesis 50:11
When the Canaanites who lived there saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, “This is a solemn mourning for the Egyptians.” Therefore, the place was named Abel Mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.

## Genesis 50:12
So Jacob’s sons did for him as he had instructed them:

## Genesis 50:13
They carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave in the field of Machpelah, opposite Mamre, which Abraham had bought along with the field as a burial site from Ephron the Hittite.

## Genesis 50:14
After burying his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, along with his brothers and all who had gone up with him to bury his father.

## Genesis 50:15
When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “What if Joseph holds a grudge against us and repays us for all the wrongs we did to him?”

## Genesis 50:16
Therefore, they sent word to Joseph, saying, “Your father gave this command before he died:

## Genesis 50:17
‘This is what you are to say to Joseph: I beg you, forgive the transgressions of your brothers and their sin, for they treated you badly.’ Now please forgive the transgressions of the servants of the God of your father.” Joseph wept when they spoke to him.

## Genesis 50:18
Then his brothers also came and bowed down before him, saying, “Behold, we are your servants.”

## Genesis 50:19
But Joseph said to them, “Do not be afraid, for am I in the place of God?

## Genesis 50:20
You intended to harm me, but God used it for good, to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives.

## Genesis 50:21
So then, do not be afraid. I will provide for you and your little ones.” And he comforted them and spoke kindly to them.

## Genesis 50:22
Joseph remained in Egypt, he and his father’s household. He lived to be a hundred and ten years old.

## Genesis 50:23
He saw the third generation of Ephraim’s children, and also the children of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were born upon Joseph’s knees.

## Genesis 50:24
Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die, but God will surely come to your aid and bring you up from this land to the land He promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”

## Genesis 50:25
Then Joseph made the sons of Israel swear an oath, saying, “God will surely come to your aid, and you must carry my bones up from this place.”

## Genesis 50:26
So Joseph passed away at the age of a hundred and ten, and after they embalmed him, he was placed in a coffin in Egypt.
