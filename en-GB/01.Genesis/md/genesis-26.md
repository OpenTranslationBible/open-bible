# Genesis Chapter 26

## Genesis 26:1
Now there was a famine in the land, apart from the earlier famine that had occurred in the days of Abraham. Isaac went to Abimelech, king of the Philistines, in Gerar.

## Genesis 26:2
The Lord appeared to Isaac and said, “Do not go down to Egypt; remain in the land that I shall tell you.

## Genesis 26:3
Reside in this land for a time, and I will be with you and bless you. To you and your descendants, I will give all these lands and will establish the oath I swore to your father Abraham.

## Genesis 26:4
I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and will give them all these lands, and through your descendants, all nations on earth will be blessed,

## Genesis 26:5
because Abraham obeyed me and kept my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.”

## Genesis 26:6
So Isaac stayed in Gerar.

## Genesis 26:7
When the men of the place asked about his wife, he said, “She is my sister,” for he feared to say, “She is my wife,” thinking, “The men of this place might kill me because of Rebekah, for she is beautiful.”

## Genesis 26:8
After Isaac had been there for a long time, Abimelech, king of the Philistines, looked out of a window and saw Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah.

## Genesis 26:9
So Abimelech summoned Isaac and said, “She is indeed your wife! Why did you say, ‘She is my sister’?” Isaac replied, “Because I thought I might be killed on account of her.”

## Genesis 26:10
Then Abimelech said, “What is this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt upon us.”

## Genesis 26:11
So Abimelech commanded all the people, saying, “Anyone who harms this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.”

## Genesis 26:12
Isaac sowed crops in that land and reaped a hundredfold in the same year, because the Lord blessed him.

## Genesis 26:13
The man became rich, and his wealth continued to increase until he became very wealthy.

## Genesis 26:14
He had many flocks, herds, and servants, so much so that the Philistines envied him.

## Genesis 26:15
All the wells that his father’s servants had dug in the days of Abraham, his father, the Philistines stopped up, filling them with earth.

## Genesis 26:16
Then Abimelech said to Isaac, “Move away from us, for you have become too powerful for us.”

## Genesis 26:17
So Isaac departed from there and camped in the Valley of Gerar, where he settled.

## Genesis 26:18
Isaac reopened the wells that had been dug in the days of Abraham, his father, which the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham died, and he gave them the same names his father had given them.

## Genesis 26:19
Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and discovered a well of fresh water there.

## Genesis 26:20
But the herders of Gerar quarrelled with those of Isaac, saying, “The water is ours!” So he named the well Esek, because they disputed with him.

## Genesis 26:21
Then they dug another well, and they quarrelled over that one also; so he named it Sitnah.

## Genesis 26:22
He moved on from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it. He named it Rehoboth, saying, “Now the Lord has given us room, and we will flourish in the land.”

## Genesis 26:23
From there he went up to Beersheba.

## Genesis 26:24
That night the Lord appeared to him and said, “I am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I am with you; I will bless you and multiply your descendants for the sake of my servant Abraham.”

## Genesis 26:25
Isaac built an altar there and called upon the name of the Lord. There he pitched his tent, and there his servants dug a well.

## Genesis 26:26
Meanwhile, Abimelech came to him from Gerar, with Ahuzzath his adviser and Phicol the commander of his army.

## Genesis 26:27
Isaac said to them, “Why have you come to me, since you were hostile to me and sent me away?”

## Genesis 26:28
They replied, “We have clearly seen that the Lord has been with you; so we said, ‘Let there now be a sworn agreement between us’—between us and you. Let us make a covenant with you

## Genesis 26:29
that you will do us no harm, just as we have not touched you and have done nothing but good to you, and sent you away in peace. You are now blessed by the Lord.”

## Genesis 26:30
Then Isaac made a feast for them, and they ate and drank.

## Genesis 26:31
Early the next morning, they exchanged oaths. Then Isaac sent them on their way, and they departed peacefully.

## Genesis 26:32
That same day, Isaac’s servants came and told him about the well they had dug. They said, “We have found water!”

## Genesis 26:33
He called it Shibah; therefore, the name of the city is Beersheba to this day.

## Genesis 26:34
When Esau was forty years old, he married Judith, daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and also Basemath, daughter of Elon the Hittite.

## Genesis 26:35
They were a source of grief to Isaac and Rebekah.
