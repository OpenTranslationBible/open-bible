# Genesis Chapter 44

## Genesis 44:1
Joseph instructed the steward of his house, “Fill the men’s sacks with as much food as they can carry, and place each man’s money at the top of his sack.

## Genesis 44:2
Also, put my silver cup in the top of the youngest one’s sack, along with his money for the grain.” And the steward did as Joseph commanded.

## Genesis 44:3
As morning broke, the men set off with their donkeys.

## Genesis 44:4
They had just left the city and were not far off when Joseph said to his steward, “Go after those men immediately, and when you catch up with them, ask, ‘Why have you repaid good with evil?

## Genesis 44:5
Is this not the cup my master drinks from and uses for divination? You have committed a wrong.’”

## Genesis 44:6
When he caught up with them, he relayed these words to them.

## Genesis 44:7
They responded, “Why does my lord speak such words? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing!

## Genesis 44:8
We even brought back to you from Canaan the money we found in the mouths of our sacks. Why would we steal silver or gold from your master’s house?

## Genesis 44:9
If any of your servants is found with it, he shall die, and the rest of us will become my lord’s slaves.”

## Genesis 44:10
He replied, “Let it be as you say. Whoever is found with it will become my slave; the rest will be free from blame.”

## Genesis 44:11
Each man quickly lowered his sack to the ground and opened it.

## Genesis 44:12
The steward began to search, starting with the oldest and ending with the youngest, and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.

## Genesis 44:13
At this, they tore their clothes in grief. Each man loaded his donkey, and they returned to the city.

## Genesis 44:14
When Judah and his brothers arrived at Joseph’s house, he was still there, and they fell to the ground before him.

## Genesis 44:15
Joseph asked them, “What is this deed you have done? Do you not know that a man like me can indeed practice divination?”

## Genesis 44:16
Judah replied, “What can we say to my lord? How can we justify ourselves? God has uncovered the guilt of your servants. We are now my lord’s slaves, both we and the one found with the cup.”

## Genesis 44:17
But Joseph said, “Far be it from me to do this. Only the man found with the cup will become my slave. The rest of you, return to your father in peace.”

## Genesis 44:18
Then Judah approached him and said, “Please, my lord, let your servant speak a word in my lord’s ears, and do not be angry with your servant, for you are like Pharaoh himself.

## Genesis 44:19
My lord asked his servants, ‘Do you have a father or a brother?’

## Genesis 44:20
We answered, ‘We have an elderly father and a young son born to him in his old age. His brother is dead, and he is the only one left of his mother’s children, and his father loves him.’

## Genesis 44:21
Then you said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me so I may see him.’

## Genesis 44:22
We told my lord, ‘The boy cannot leave his father; if he leaves, his father would die.’

## Genesis 44:23
But you said to your servants, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes with you, you will not see my face again.’

## Genesis 44:24
When we returned to your servant my father, we relayed what my lord had said.

## Genesis 44:25
Our father instructed us, ‘Go back and buy a little more food.’

## Genesis 44:26
But we said, ‘We cannot go down unless our youngest brother is with us. We cannot see the man’s face unless he is with us.’

## Genesis 44:27
Your servant my father said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me two sons.

## Genesis 44:28
One left me, and I said, “He must have been torn to pieces.” I have not seen him since.

## Genesis 44:29
If you take this one from me too and harm befalls him, you will bring my grey head down to the grave in misery.’

## Genesis 44:30
Now, if the boy is not with us when I return to your servant my father, and if my father, whose life is closely tied to the boy’s life,

## Genesis 44:31
sees that the boy is not with us, he will die. Your servants will bring the grey head of our father down to the grave in sorrow.

## Genesis 44:32
Your servant guaranteed the boy’s safety to my father, saying, ‘If I do not bring him back, I will bear the blame before my father all my life.’

## Genesis 44:33
Now, please let your servant remain as my lord’s slave in place of the boy, and let the boy return with his brothers.

## Genesis 44:34
How can I return to my father if the boy is not with me? I fear to see the misery that would overtake my father.”
