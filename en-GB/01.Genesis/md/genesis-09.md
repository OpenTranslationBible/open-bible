# Genesis Chapter 9

## Genesis 9:1
Then God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth.

## Genesis 9:2
The fear and dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth and every bird of the sky, on all that moves on the ground, and on all the fish of the sea; they are given into your hands.

## Genesis 9:3
Every living thing that moves shall be food for you; just as I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything.

## Genesis 9:4
But you must not eat meat that has its lifeblood still in it.

## Genesis 9:5
And for your lifeblood I will surely require an accounting; from every animal I will require it. And from each human being, I will demand an accounting for the life of another human being.

## Genesis 9:6
Whoever sheds human blood, by humans shall their blood be shed; for in the image of God He made mankind.

## Genesis 9:7
As for you, be fruitful and multiply; increase greatly on the earth and multiply in it.”

## Genesis 9:8
Then God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying,

## Genesis 9:9
“Behold, I establish My covenant with you and your descendants after you,

## Genesis 9:10
and with every living creature that is with you: the birds, the livestock, and all the wild animals, all those that came out of the ark with you—every living creature on earth.

## Genesis 9:11
I establish My covenant with you: never again will all life be destroyed by the waters of a flood; nor shall there ever again be a flood to destroy the earth.”

## Genesis 9:12
And God said, “This is the sign of the covenant I am making between Me and you and every living creature with you, for all future generations:

## Genesis 9:13
I have set My rainbow in the clouds, and it will be the sign of the covenant between Me and the earth.

## Genesis 9:14
Whenever I bring clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds,

## Genesis 9:15
I will remember My covenant between Me and you and all living creatures of every kind. Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all flesh.

## Genesis 9:16
When the rainbow is in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and all living creatures of every kind on the earth.”

## Genesis 9:17
So God said to Noah, “This is the sign of the covenant I have established between Me and all life on the earth.”

## Genesis 9:18
The sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. (Ham was the father of Canaan.)

## Genesis 9:19
These were the three sons of Noah, and from them the whole earth was populated.

## Genesis 9:20
Noah, a man of the soil, began to plant a vineyard.

## Genesis 9:21
He drank some of the wine, became drunk, and lay uncovered inside his tent.

## Genesis 9:22
Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father’s nakedness and told his two brothers outside.

## Genesis 9:23
But Shem and Japheth took a garment, laid it across their shoulders, and walked backward to cover their father’s nakedness. Their faces were turned away so that they would not see their father’s nakedness.

## Genesis 9:24
When Noah awoke from his wine and found out what his youngest son had done to him,

## Genesis 9:25
he said, “Cursed be Canaan! The lowest of slaves shall he be to his brothers.”

## Genesis 9:26
He also said, “Blessed be the Lord, the God of Shem! May Canaan be the slave of Shem.

## Genesis 9:27
May God enlarge Japheth, and may he dwell in the tents of Shem; and may Canaan be his servant.”

## Genesis 9:28
Noah lived 350 years after the flood.

## Genesis 9:29
So all the days of Noah were 950 years, and then he died.
