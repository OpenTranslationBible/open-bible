# Genesis Chapter 4

## Genesis 4:1
Adam was intimate with his wife Eve, and she conceived and gave birth to Cain. She said, “With the help of the Lord, I have acquired a man.”

## Genesis 4:2
Later, she gave birth to Cain's brother Abel. Abel was a shepherd, while Cain was a tiller of the soil.

## Genesis 4:3
In time, Cain brought some of the produce of the land as an offering to the Lord.

## Genesis 4:4
Abel also brought an offering—fat portions from the firstborn of his flock. The Lord looked favourably upon Abel and his offering,

## Genesis 4:5
but He did not regard Cain and his offering. Cain became very angry, and his face fell.

## Genesis 4:6
The Lord asked Cain, “Why are you angry? Why is your face downcast?

## Genesis 4:7
If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must master it.”

## Genesis 4:8
Cain spoke to his brother Abel. While they were in the field, Cain rose up against Abel and killed him.

## Genesis 4:9
Then the Lord said to Cain, “Where is your brother Abel?” He replied, “I do not know. Am I my brother’s keeper?”

## Genesis 4:10
The Lord said, “What have you done? Your brother’s blood cries out to me from the ground.

## Genesis 4:11
As a result, you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.

## Genesis 4:12
When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its strength to you. You will be a wanderer and a drifter on the earth.”

## Genesis 4:13
Cain said to the Lord, “This punishment is more than I can bear!

## Genesis 4:14
Today you have driven me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a wanderer and a drifter on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.”

## Genesis 4:15
But the Lord said to him, “Not so; whoever kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over.” And the Lord placed a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him.

## Genesis 4:16
Cain departed from the presence of the Lord and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden.

## Genesis 4:17
Cain was intimate with his wife, and she conceived and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was building a city, and he named it after his son Enoch.

## Genesis 4:18
Enoch became the father of Irad, and Irad fathered Mehujael, and Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech.

## Genesis 4:19
Lamech took two wives: one named Adah and the other Zillah.

## Genesis 4:20
Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the ancestor of those who live in tents and raise livestock.

## Genesis 4:21
His brother’s name was Jubal; he was the ancestor of all who play stringed instruments and pipes.

## Genesis 4:22
Zillah also gave birth to Tubal-Cain, who forged all kinds of tools out of bronze and iron. Tubal-Cain’s sister was Naamah.

## Genesis 4:23
Lamech said to his wives, “Adah and Zillah, listen to me; wives of Lamech, hear my words. I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for striking me.

## Genesis 4:24
If Cain is avenged seven times, then Lamech will be avenged seventy-seven times.”

## Genesis 4:25
Adam was intimate with his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth, saying, “God has granted me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him.”

## Genesis 4:26
Seth also had a son, and he named him Enosh. At that time, people began to call upon the name of the Lord.
