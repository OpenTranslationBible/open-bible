# Genesis Chapter 18

## Genesis 18:1
The Lord appeared to Abraham by the oaks of Mamre, while he was sitting at the entrance of his tent in the heat of the day.

## Genesis 18:2
Abraham raised his eyes and saw three men standing nearby. When he saw them, he ran from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed low to the ground.

## Genesis 18:3
He said, “My Lord, if I have found favour in your sight, please do not pass your servant by.

## Genesis 18:4
Let a little water be brought, and you may wash your feet and rest under the tree.

## Genesis 18:5
Let me bring you a piece of bread, so you can refresh yourselves and then go on your way, now that you have come to your servant.” And they said, “Do as you have said.”

## Genesis 18:6
So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah and said, “Quickly, prepare three measures of fine flour, knead it, and make some bread.”

## Genesis 18:7
Then he ran to the herd, selected a tender and choice calf, and gave it to a servant, who hurried to prepare it.

## Genesis 18:8
He took curds, milk, and the calf that had been prepared, and set them before the men. While they ate, he stood near them under the tree.

## Genesis 18:9
They asked him, “Where is your wife Sarah?” He replied, “There, in the tent.”

## Genesis 18:10
One of them said, “I will surely return to you at this time next year, and behold, your wife Sarah will have a son.” Sarah was listening at the entrance of the tent, which was behind him.

## Genesis 18:11
Now Abraham and Sarah were old, advanced in age; Sarah was past the age of childbearing.

## Genesis 18:12
So Sarah laughed to herself, thinking, “After I am worn out and my lord is old, shall I have this pleasure?”

## Genesis 18:13
Then the Lord said to Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh and say, ‘Shall I indeed bear a child, now that I am old?’

## Genesis 18:14
Is anything too difficult for the Lord? At the appointed time next year, I will return to you, and Sarah will have a son.”

## Genesis 18:15
Sarah was afraid, so she denied it, saying, “I did not laugh.” But He said, “No, but you did laugh.”

## Genesis 18:16
When the men rose up to leave, they looked down towards Sodom, and Abraham walked with them to see them on their way.

## Genesis 18:17
The Lord considered, “Shall I keep from Abraham what I am going to do?

## Genesis 18:18
Since Abraham will surely become a great and powerful nation, and all nations on earth will be blessed through him.

## Genesis 18:19
For I have chosen him, so that he may command his children and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord by doing what is right and just, so that the Lord may bring about for Abraham what He has promised him.”

## Genesis 18:20
Then the Lord said, “The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is indeed great, and their sin is exceedingly grave.

## Genesis 18:21
I will go down now and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me. If not, I will know.”

## Genesis 18:22
The men turned and headed towards Sodom, while Abraham remained in the presence of the Lord.

## Genesis 18:23
Abraham approached Him and said, “Will you indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked?

## Genesis 18:24
Suppose there are fifty righteous people in the city; will you really sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous who are in it?

## Genesis 18:25
Far be it from you to do such a thing—to kill the righteous with the wicked, treating the righteous and the wicked alike. Far be it from you! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?”

## Genesis 18:26
The Lord said, “If I find fifty righteous people in the city of Sodom, I will spare the entire place for their sake.”

## Genesis 18:27
Then Abraham spoke up again: “Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, although I am nothing but dust and ashes,

## Genesis 18:28
suppose the fifty righteous are lacking five, will you destroy the entire city for lack of five?” He said, “I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there.”

## Genesis 18:29
He spoke to Him again, “Suppose forty are found there?” He said, “For the sake of forty, I will not do it.”

## Genesis 18:30
Then he said, “May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak; suppose thirty are found there?” He answered, “I will not do it if I find thirty there.”

## Genesis 18:31
Abraham said, “Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, suppose twenty are found there?” He said, “For the sake of twenty, I will not destroy it.”

## Genesis 18:32
Then he said, “May the Lord not be angry, but let me speak just once more; suppose ten are found there?” He answered, “For the sake of ten, I will not destroy it.”

## Genesis 18:33
When the Lord had finished speaking with Abraham, He went on His way, and Abraham returned to his place.
