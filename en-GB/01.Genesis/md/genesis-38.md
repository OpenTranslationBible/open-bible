# Genesis Chapter 38

## Genesis 38:1
At that time, Judah departed from his brothers and went to stay with a certain Adullamite named Hirah.

## Genesis 38:2
There, Judah saw the daughter of a Canaanite man named Shua; he took her as his wife and had relations with her.

## Genesis 38:3
She conceived and bore a son, and he named him Er.

## Genesis 38:4
She conceived again and gave birth to a son, whom she named Onan.

## Genesis 38:5
She bore yet another son and named him Shelah; it was at Chezib that she gave birth to him.

## Genesis 38:6
Judah found a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.

## Genesis 38:7
But Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the Lord, so the Lord put him to death.

## Genesis 38:8
Then Judah said to Onan, “Go in to your brother’s wife and perform your duty as a brother-in-law to her, to raise up offspring for your brother.”

## Genesis 38:9
But Onan knew that the offspring would not be his; so whenever he had relations with his brother’s wife, he spilled his seed on the ground to avoid providing offspring for his brother.

## Genesis 38:10
What he did was displeasing in the sight of the Lord, so the Lord put him to death as well.

## Genesis 38:11
Then Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, “Live as a widow in your father’s house until my son Shelah grows up.” For he thought, “He might die too, like his brothers.” So Tamar went to live in her father’s house.

## Genesis 38:12
After a considerable time, Judah’s wife, the daughter of Shua, died. When Judah had recovered from his grief, he went to Timnah to his sheepshearers, accompanied by his friend Hirah the Adullamite.

## Genesis 38:13
Tamar was informed, “Your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.”

## Genesis 38:14
So she removed her widow’s garments, covered herself with a veil, and sat at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah. She saw that Shelah had grown up, yet she had not been given to him as a wife.

## Genesis 38:15
When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, because she had covered her face.

## Genesis 38:16
Not realising she was his daughter-in-law, he approached her by the roadside and said, “Come now, let me have relations with you.” She asked, “What will you give me to have relations with me?”

## Genesis 38:17
He replied, “I will send you a young goat from my flock.” She asked, “Will you give me a pledge until you send it?”

## Genesis 38:18
He said, “What pledge shall I give you?” She answered, “Your seal and its cord, and the staff in your hand.” So he gave them to her and had relations with her, and she conceived by him.

## Genesis 38:19
Then she got up and left, removed her veil, and put on her widow’s garments again.

## Genesis 38:20
Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite to retrieve the pledge from the woman, but he did not find her.

## Genesis 38:21
He asked the men of the place, “Where is the temple prostitute who was by the road at Enaim?” They replied, “There has been no temple prostitute here.”

## Genesis 38:22
So he returned to Judah and said, “I did not find her, and the men of the place said, ‘There has been no temple prostitute here.’”

## Genesis 38:23
Then Judah said, “Let her keep the things, or we will become a laughingstock. After all, I sent this young goat, but you did not find her.”

## Genesis 38:24
About three months later, Judah was informed, “Your daughter-in-law Tamar has prostituted herself, and she is now pregnant.” Judah said, “Bring her out and let her be burned!”

## Genesis 38:25
As she was being brought out, she sent a message to her father-in-law, saying, “I am pregnant by the man who owns these.” She added, “Please examine and see whose signet ring, cord, and staff these are.”

## Genesis 38:26
Judah recognised them and said, “She is more righteous than I, since I did not give her to my son Shelah.” And he did not have relations with her again.

## Genesis 38:27
When it was time for her to give birth, she was carrying twins.

## Genesis 38:28
While she was giving birth, one of them put out his hand, and the midwife tied a scarlet thread on his wrist, saying, “This one came out first.”

## Genesis 38:29
But as he drew back his hand, his brother came out, and she said, “What a breach you have made for yourself!” So he was named Perez.

## Genesis 38:30
Afterwards, his brother, who had the scarlet thread on his wrist, came out, and he was named Zerah.
