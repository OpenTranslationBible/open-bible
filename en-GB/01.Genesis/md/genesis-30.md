# Genesis Chapter 30

## Genesis 30:1

Now when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, she became jealous of her sister; and she said to Jacob, “Give me children, or else I die.”

## Genesis 30:2

Then Jacob’s anger burned against Rachel, and he said, “Am I in the place of God, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?”

## Genesis 30:3

So she said, “Here is my female servant Bilhah; go in to her, that she may bear a child on my knees, so that by her I too may obtain children.”

## Genesis 30:4

So she gave him her servant Bilhah as a wife, and Jacob went in to her.

## Genesis 30:5

Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son.

## Genesis 30:6

Then Rachel said, “God has vindicated me, and has indeed heard my voice and given me a son.” Therefore she named him Dan.

## Genesis 30:7

And Rachel’s servant Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.

## Genesis 30:8

So Rachel said, “With mighty wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister, and I have indeed prevailed.” And she named him Naphtali.

## Genesis 30:9

When Leah saw that she had stopped bearing, she took her servant Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife.

## Genesis 30:10

And Leah’s servant Zilpah bore Jacob a son.

## Genesis 30:11

Then Leah said, “How fortunate!” So she named him Gad.

## Genesis 30:12

And Leah’s servant Zilpah bore Jacob a second son.

## Genesis 30:13

Then Leah said, “Happy am I! For women will call me happy.” So she named him Asher.

## Genesis 30:14

Now in the days of the wheat harvest Reuben went and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.”

## Genesis 30:15

But she said to her, “Is it not enough that you have taken my husband? Would you also take my son’s mandrakes?” So Rachel said, “Therefore he may lie with you tonight in return for your son’s mandrakes.”

## Genesis 30:16

When Jacob came in from the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, “You must come in to me, for I have hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” So he lay with her that night.

## Genesis 30:17

God listened to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son.

## Genesis 30:18

Then Leah said, “God has given me my wages because I gave my servant to my husband.” So she named him Issachar.

## Genesis 30:19

Leah conceived again and bore a sixth son to Jacob.

## Genesis 30:20

Then Leah said, “God has endowed me with a good gift; now my husband will dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons.” So she named him Zebulun.

## Genesis 30:21

Afterward she gave birth to a daughter, and named her Dinah.

## Genesis 30:22

Then God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her and opened her womb.

## Genesis 30:23

So she conceived and bore a son, and said, “God has taken away my disgrace.”

## Genesis 30:24

And she named him Joseph, saying, “May the Lord give me another son.”

## Genesis 30:25

Now it came about when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, “Send me away, that I may go to my own place and to my own country.

## Genesis 30:26

Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me go; for you yourself know my service which I have rendered you.”

## Genesis 30:27

But Laban said to him, “If now it pleases you, stay; I have divined that the Lord has blessed me on your account.”

## Genesis 30:28

And he continued, “Name me your wages, and I will give it.”

## Genesis 30:29

But Jacob said to him, “You yourself know how I have served you and how your livestock has fared with me.

## Genesis 30:30

For you had little before I came, and it has increased to a multitude, and the Lord has blessed you wherever I turned. But now, when shall I provide for my own household also?”

## Genesis 30:31

So he said, “What shall I give you?” And Jacob said, “You shall not give me anything. If you will do this one thing for me, I will again pasture and keep your flock:

## Genesis 30:32

Let me pass through your entire flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted sheep, and every black sheep among the lambs, and the spotted and speckled among the goats; and such shall be my wages.

## Genesis 30:33

So my honesty will answer for me later, when you come to check over my wages with you. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and black among the lambs, if found with me, shall be considered stolen.”

## Genesis 30:34

Laban said, “Good, let it be according to your word.”

## Genesis 30:35

So he removed on that day the striped and spotted male goats and all the speckled and spotted female goats, every one with white on it, and all the black sheep, and gave them into the care of his sons.

## Genesis 30:36

And he put a distance of three days’ journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks.

## Genesis 30:37

Then Jacob took fresh rods of poplar, almond, and plane trees, and peeled white stripes in them, exposing the white which was in the rods.

## Genesis 30:38

He set the rods which he had peeled in front of the flocks in the troughs, that is, in the watering channels where the flocks came to drink; and they mated when they came to drink.

## Genesis 30:39

So the flocks mated by the rods, and the flocks brought forth striped, speckled, and spotted offspring.

## Genesis 30:40

Jacob separated the lambs, and made the flocks face toward the striped and all the black in the flock of Laban; and he put his own herds apart and did not put them with Laban’s flock.

## Genesis 30:41

Moreover, whenever the stronger of the flock were mating, Jacob would place the rods in the sight of the flock in the watering troughs, so that they would mate by the rods.

## Genesis 30:42

But when the flock was weak, he did not put them in; so the weaker were Laban’s, and the stronger were Jacob’s.

## Genesis 30:43

So the man became exceedingly prosperous, and had large flocks, and female and male servants, and camels and donkeys.
