# Genesis Chapter 30

## Genesis 30:1
When Rachel observed that she was not bearing children for Jacob, she became envious of her sister and said to Jacob, “Give me children, or else I shall die!”

## Genesis 30:2
Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel, and he said, “Am I in the place of God, who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb?”

## Genesis 30:3
Then she said, “Here is my maid Bilhah; go in to her, that she may bear children on my behalf, so that I too may have a family through her.”

## Genesis 30:4
So she gave him her maid Bilhah as a wife, and Jacob went in to her.

## Genesis 30:5
Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son.

## Genesis 30:6
Rachel said, “God has judged me, and has indeed heard my voice and given me a son.” Therefore she named him Dan.

## Genesis 30:7
Rachel’s maid Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son.

## Genesis 30:8
Rachel said, “With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed.” So she named him Naphtali.

## Genesis 30:9
When Leah saw that she had ceased bearing children, she took her maid Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife.

## Genesis 30:10
And Leah’s maid Zilpah gave birth to a son for Jacob.

## Genesis 30:11
Leah said, “What good fortune!” So she named him Gad.

## Genesis 30:12
Leah’s maid Zilpah bore Jacob a second son.

## Genesis 30:13
Leah said, “Happy am I! For the daughters will call me blessed.” So she named him Asher.

## Genesis 30:14
During the wheat harvest, Reuben went and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.”

## Genesis 30:15
But she said to her, “Is it a small matter that you have taken my husband? Would you take my son’s mandrakes also?” Rachel replied, “Very well, he shall sleep with you tonight in exchange for your son’s mandrakes.”

## Genesis 30:16
When Jacob came in from the fields in the evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, “You must come in to me, for I have hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” So he lay with her that night.

## Genesis 30:17
God listened to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son.

## Genesis 30:18
Leah said, “God has rewarded me for giving my maid to my husband.” So she named him Issachar.

## Genesis 30:19
Leah conceived again and gave birth to a sixth son for Jacob.

## Genesis 30:20
Leah said, “God has endowed me with a good gift; now my husband will honour me, because I have borne him six sons.” So she named him Zebulun.

## Genesis 30:21
Afterwards she bore a daughter and named her Dinah.

## Genesis 30:22
Then God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her and opened her womb.

## Genesis 30:23
She conceived and bore a son, and said, “God has taken away my reproach.”

## Genesis 30:24
She named him Joseph, saying, “May the Lord add to me another son.”

## Genesis 30:25
After Rachel had given birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Allow me to leave, that I may go to my own place and to my own country.

## Genesis 30:26
Return my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me go; for you know the service I have provided.”

## Genesis 30:27
But Laban said to him, “If I have found favour in your eyes, please stay. I have learned through experience that the Lord has blessed me because of you.”

## Genesis 30:28
He said, “Name your wages, and I will pay them.”

## Genesis 30:29
Jacob said to him, “You are aware of how I have served you, and how your livestock have prospered under my care.

## Genesis 30:30
For you had little before I came, and it has increased greatly, and the Lord has blessed you wherever I turned. But now, when shall I provide for my own household also?”

## Genesis 30:31
“What shall I give you?” he asked. Jacob replied, “You shall not give me anything. If you will do this one thing for me, I will continue to shepherd your flock:

## Genesis 30:32
Let me pass through all your flock today, removing from it every speckled and spotted sheep, and every dark-coloured lamb, and the spotted and speckled among the goats; these shall be my wages.

## Genesis 30:33
So my honesty will answer for me later, when you come to check on my wages. Every one that is not speckled or spotted among the goats, or dark-coloured among the lambs, if found with me, will be considered stolen.”

## Genesis 30:34
Laban said, “Agreed, let it be as you have said.”

## Genesis 30:35
That same day he removed the streaked and spotted male goats, and all the speckled and spotted female goats, every one that had white on it, and all the dark-coloured lambs, and put them in the care of his sons.

## Genesis 30:36
He put a distance of three days’ journey between himself and Jacob, while Jacob continued to tend the rest of Laban’s flocks.

## Genesis 30:37
Jacob then took fresh rods of poplar, almond, and plane trees, and peeled white stripes in them, exposing the white of the rods.

## Genesis 30:38
He set the rods he had peeled in front of the flocks in the troughs, the watering places where the flocks came to drink, and they mated when they came to drink.

## Genesis 30:39
The flocks mated by the rods, and the flocks bore young that were streaked, speckled, and spotted.

## Genesis 30:40
Jacob separated the lambs, and made the flocks face towards the streaked and all the dark-coloured animals in Laban’s flock; and he put his own herds apart, and did not put them with Laban’s flock.

## Genesis 30:41
Whenever the stronger females were in heat, Jacob would place the rods in the troughs in front of the animals, so they would mate near the rods;

## Genesis 30:42
but when the animals were weak, he would not put them there. So the weak animals went to Laban and the strong ones to Jacob.

## Genesis 30:43
In this way the man became exceedingly prosperous, and had large flocks, and female and male servants, and camels and donkeys.
