# Genesis Chapter 24

## Genesis 24:1

Now Abraham was old, advanced in age; and the Lord had blessed Abraham in every way.

## Genesis 24:2

Abraham said to his servant, the oldest of his household, who was in charge of all that he owned, “Place your hand under my thigh,

## Genesis 24:3

And I will make you swear by the Lord, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I live;

## Genesis 24:4

But you shall go to my country and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son Isaac.”

## Genesis 24:5

The servant said to him, “Suppose the woman is not willing to follow me to this land; should I take your son back to the land from where you came?”

## Genesis 24:6

Then Abraham said to him, “Beware that you do not take my son back there!

## Genesis 24:7

The Lord, the God of heaven, who took me from my father’s house and from the land of my birth, and who spoke to me and swore to me, saying, ‘To your descendants I will give this land,’ He will send His angel before you, and you will take a wife for my son from there.

## Genesis 24:8

But if the woman is not willing to follow you, then you will be free from this oath of mine; only do not take my son back there.”

## Genesis 24:9

So the servant placed his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore to him concerning this matter.

## Genesis 24:10

Then the servant took ten camels from the camels of his master, and set out with a variety of good things of his master’s in his hand; and he went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.

## Genesis 24:11

He made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at evening time, the time when women go out to draw water.

## Genesis 24:12

He said, “Lord, God of my master Abraham, please grant me success today, and show kindness to my master Abraham.

## Genesis 24:13

Behold, I am standing by the spring, and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water;

## Genesis 24:14

Now may it be that the girl to whom I say, ‘Please let down your jar so that I may drink,’ and she says, ‘Drink, and I will water your camels also’—may she be the one whom You have appointed for Your servant Isaac; and by this I will know that You have shown kindness to my master.”

## Genesis 24:15

Before he had finished speaking, behold, Rebekah, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Abraham’s brother Nahor, came out with her jar on her shoulder.

## Genesis 24:16

The girl was very beautiful, a virgin; no man had had relations with her. She went down to the spring, filled her jar, and came up.

## Genesis 24:17

Then the servant ran to meet her and said, “Please let me drink a little water from your jar.”

## Genesis 24:18

So she said, “Drink, my lord”; and she quickly lowered her jar to her hand and gave him a drink.

## Genesis 24:19

Now when she had finished giving him a drink, she said, “I will also draw water for your camels until they have finished drinking.”

## Genesis 24:20

So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough, and ran back to the well to draw, and she drew for all his camels.

## Genesis 24:21

Meanwhile, the man was taking a close look at her in silence, to find out whether the Lord had made his journey successful or not.

## Genesis 24:22

When the camels had finished drinking, the man took a gold ring weighing a half-shekel, and two bracelets for her wrists weighing ten shekels in gold,

## Genesis 24:23

And said, “Whose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room for us to stay overnight at your father’s house?”

## Genesis 24:24

She said to him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.”

## Genesis 24:25

Again she said to him, “We have plenty of both straw and feed, and room to stay overnight.”

## Genesis 24:26

Then the man bowed low and worshipped the Lord.

## Genesis 24:27

And he said, “Blessed be the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, who has not abandoned His kindness and His truth toward my master. As for me, the Lord has guided me on the way to the house of my master’s brothers.”

## Genesis 24:28

Then the girl ran and told her mother’s household about these things.

## Genesis 24:29

Now Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban; and Laban ran outside to the man at the spring.

## Genesis 24:30

When he saw the ring and the bracelets on his sister’s wrists, and when he heard the words of his sister Rebekah, saying, “This is what the man said to me,” he went to the man; and behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring.

## Genesis 24:31

And he said, “Come in, blessed of the Lord! Why do you stand outside, since I have prepared the house, and a place for the camels?”

## Genesis 24:32

So the man entered the house. Then Laban unloaded the camels, and he gave straw and feed to the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.

## Genesis 24:33

But when food was set before him to eat, he said, “I will not eat until I have stated my business.” And Laban said, “Speak on.”

## Genesis 24:34

So he said, “I am Abraham’s servant.

## Genesis 24:35

The Lord has greatly blessed my master, so that he has become rich; and He has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, servants and maids, camels and donkeys.

## Genesis 24:36

Now my master’s wife Sarah bore a son to my master in her old age, and he has given him all that he has.

## Genesis 24:37

My master made me swear, saying, ‘You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live;

## Genesis 24:38

But you shall go to my father’s house and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son.’

## Genesis 24:39

Then I said to my master, ‘Suppose the woman does not follow me.’

## Genesis 24:40

And he said to me, ‘The Lord, before whom I have walked, will send His angel with you to make your journey successful, and you will take a wife for my son from my relatives and from my father’s house;

## Genesis 24:41

Then you will be free from my oath, when you come to my relatives; and if they do not give her to you, you will be free from my oath.’

## Genesis 24:42

So I came today to the spring, and said, ‘Lord, God of my master Abraham, if now You will make my journey successful,

## Genesis 24:43

Behold, I am standing by the spring, and may it be that the maiden who comes out to draw, and to whom I say, “Please let me drink a little water from your jar,”

## Genesis 24:44

And she says to me, “You drink, and I will also draw for your camels,” let her be the woman whom the Lord has appointed for my master’s son.’

## Genesis 24:45

Before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder, and went down to the spring and drew water. So I said to her, ‘Please let me drink.’

## Genesis 24:46

She quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder and said, ‘Drink, and I will also water your camels.’ So I drank, and she also watered the camels.

## Genesis 24:47

Then I asked her, and said, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ And she said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore to him.’ And I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her wrists.

## Genesis 24:48

And I bowed low and worshipped the Lord, and blessed the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, who had guided me in the right way to take the daughter of my master’s relative for his son.

## Genesis 24:49

So now if you are going to deal kindly and truthfully with my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, so that I may turn to the right or the left.”

## Genesis 24:50

Then Laban and Bethuel replied, “The matter has come from the Lord; so we cannot speak to you bad or good.

## Genesis 24:51

Here is Rebekah before you; take her and go, and let her be the wife of your master’s son, as the Lord has spoken.”

## Genesis 24:52

When Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed himself to the ground before the Lord.

## Genesis 24:53

And the servant brought out articles of silver and articles of gold, and garments, and gave them to Rebekah; he also gave precious things to her brother and to her mother.

## Genesis 24:54

Then he and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night. When they got up in the morning, he said, “Send me away to my master.”

## Genesis 24:55

But her brother and her mother said, “Let the girl stay with us a few days, say ten; afterward she may go.”

## Genesis 24:56

And he said to them, “Do not delay me, since the Lord has made my journey successful. Send me away so that I may go to my master.”

## Genesis 24:57

And they said, “We will call the girl and ask her.”

## Genesis 24:58

Then they called Rebekah and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” And she said, “I will go.”

## Genesis 24:59

So they sent away their sister Rebekah and her nurse with Abraham’s servant and his men.

## Genesis 24:60

And they blessed Rebekah and said to her,

> “May you, our sister, become thousands of ten thousands,  
> And may your descendants possess the gate of those who hate them.”

## Genesis 24:61

Then Rebekah got up with her female attendants, and they mounted the camels and followed the man. So the servant took Rebekah and departed.

## Genesis 24:62

Now Isaac had come from going to Beer-lahai-roi; for he was living in the land of the Negev.

## Genesis 24:63

Isaac went out to meditate in the field toward evening; and he raised his eyes and looked, and behold, camels were coming.

## Genesis 24:64

Rebekah raised her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she dismounted from the camel.

## Genesis 24:65

She said to the servant, “Who is that man walking in the field to meet us?” And the servant said, “He is my master.” Then she took her veil and covered herself.

## Genesis 24:66

The servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.

## Genesis 24:67

Then Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and he took Rebekah, and she became his wife, and he loved her; so Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.
