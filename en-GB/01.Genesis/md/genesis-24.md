# Genesis Chapter 24

## Genesis 24:1
Abraham was now old, well advanced in years, and the Lord had blessed him in every aspect.

## Genesis 24:2
Abraham said to the senior servant of his household, who managed all he owned, “Please place your hand under my thigh,

## Genesis 24:3
and I will have you swear by the Lord, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you will not choose a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell;

## Genesis 24:4
but you shall go to my homeland and to my family, and find a wife for my son Isaac.”

## Genesis 24:5
The servant asked him, “What if the woman is not willing to return with me to this land? Should I then take your son back to the land you came from?”

## Genesis 24:6
“Be careful not to take my son back there,” Abraham replied.

## Genesis 24:7
“The Lord, the God of heaven, who brought me from my father's house and from my native land, and who spoke to me and swore to me, saying, ‘To your descendants I will give this land’—He will send His angel before you, and you shall take a wife for my son from there.

## Genesis 24:8
But if the woman is not willing to follow you, then you will be released from this oath of mine; only do not take my son back there.”

## Genesis 24:9
So the servant placed his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore an oath to him concerning this matter.

## Genesis 24:10
Then the servant took ten of his master’s camels and departed, taking with him a variety of good things from his master. He set out and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.

## Genesis 24:11
He made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at evening time, the time when women go out to draw water.

## Genesis 24:12
And he prayed, “Lord, God of my master Abraham, please grant me success today, and show kindness to my master Abraham.

## Genesis 24:13
See, I am standing by the spring, and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water.

## Genesis 24:14
Let it be that the young woman to whom I say, ‘Please let down your jar that I may drink,’ and who replies, ‘Drink, and I will also water your camels’—let her be the one You have appointed for Your servant Isaac. By this I will know that You have shown kindness to my master.”

## Genesis 24:15
Before he had finished praying, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Abraham’s brother Nahor.

## Genesis 24:16
The young woman was very beautiful, a virgin; no man had lain with her. She went down to the spring, filled her jar, and came up.

## Genesis 24:17
The servant hurried to meet her and said, “Please give me a little water from your jar.”

## Genesis 24:18
“Drink, my lord,” she said, and quickly lowered her jar to her hands and gave him a drink.

## Genesis 24:19
After she had given him a drink, she said, “I will draw water for your camels too, until they have finished drinking.”

## Genesis 24:20
So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough, ran back to the well to draw more water, and drew enough for all his camels.

## Genesis 24:21
The man watched her closely in silence to see whether the Lord had made his journey successful or not.

## Genesis 24:22
When the camels had finished drinking, the man took out a gold nose ring weighing a half-shekel, and two gold bracelets weighing ten shekels.

## Genesis 24:23
Then he asked, “Whose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room in your father’s house for us to spend the night?”

## Genesis 24:24
She replied, “I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son Milcah bore to Nahor.”

## Genesis 24:25
And she added, “We have plenty of straw and feed, as well as room to spend the night.”

## Genesis 24:26
Then the man bowed down and worshipped the Lord,

## Genesis 24:27
saying, “Blessed be the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, who has not abandoned His kindness and faithfulness to my master. As for me, the Lord has led me on the journey to the house of my master’s relatives.”

## Genesis 24:28
The young woman ran and told her mother’s household about these things.

## Genesis 24:29
Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and he ran out to the man at the spring.

## Genesis 24:30
As soon as he saw the nose ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s arms, and heard Rebekah’s account of what the man said to her, he went out to the man and found him standing by the camels near the spring.

## Genesis 24:31
“Come, you who are blessed by the Lord,” he said. “Why are you standing out here? I have prepared the house and a place for the camels.”

## Genesis 24:32
So the man went to the house, and the camels were unloaded. Straw and feed were brought for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.

## Genesis 24:33
Food was set before him, but he said, “I will not eat until I have told you what I have to say.” “Speak on,” Laban said.

## Genesis 24:34
So he said, “I am Abraham’s servant.

## Genesis 24:35
The Lord has greatly blessed my master, and he has become wealthy. He has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male and female servants, and camels and donkeys.

## Genesis 24:36
My master’s wife Sarah bore him a son in her old age, and he has given him everything he owns.

## Genesis 24:37
My master made me swear an oath, saying, ‘You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live;

## Genesis 24:38
but you shall go to my father’s family and to my own clan, and find a wife for my son.’

## Genesis 24:39
Then I asked my master, ‘What if the woman does not follow me?’

## Genesis 24:40
He replied, ‘The Lord, before whom I have walked, will send His angel with you and make your journey successful, so that you can find a wife for my son from my own clan and from my father’s family.

## Genesis 24:41
You will be released from my oath if, when you go to my family, they refuse to give her to you—then you will be released from my oath.’

## Genesis 24:42
“When I came to the spring today, I prayed, ‘Lord, God of my master Abraham, if You will, please grant success to the journey on which I have come.

## Genesis 24:43
Behold, I am standing by the spring. If a young woman comes out to draw water and I say to her, “Please let me drink a little water from your jar,”

## Genesis 24:44
and she replies, “Drink, and I will draw water for your camels too,” let her be the one the Lord has chosen for my master’s son.’

## Genesis 24:45
“Before I had finished praying in my heart, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder. She went down to the spring and drew water, and I said to her, ‘Please give me a drink.’

## Genesis 24:46
She quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder and said, ‘Drink, and I will water your camels too.’ So I drank, and she watered the camels also.

## Genesis 24:47
I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ She said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, son of Nahor, whom Milcah bore to him.’ Then I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her wrists.

## Genesis 24:48
I bowed down and worshipped the Lord. I praised the Lord, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me on the right path to take the daughter of my master’s brother for his son.

## Genesis 24:49
Now if you will show kindness and faithfulness to my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, so I may know which way to turn.”

## Genesis 24:50
Laban and Bethuel answered, “This matter is from the Lord; we cannot speak to you good or bad.

## Genesis 24:51
Here is Rebekah; take her and go, and let her become the wife of your master’s son, as the Lord has spoken.”

## Genesis 24:52
When Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed down to the ground before the Lord.

## Genesis 24:53
Then the servant brought out silver and gold jewellery and garments and gave them to Rebekah; he also gave precious gifts to her brother and her mother.

## Genesis 24:54
Then he and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night there. When they rose in the morning, he said, “Send me on my way to my master.”

## Genesis 24:55
But her brother and her mother said, “Let the young woman stay with us a few days, say ten; then she may go.”

## Genesis 24:56
But he said to them, “Do not delay me, now that the Lord has granted success to my journey. Send me on my way so I may go to my master.”

## Genesis 24:57
Then they said, “Let us call the young woman and ask her.”

## Genesis 24:58
So they called Rebekah and asked her, “Will you go with this man?” She said, “I will go.”

## Genesis 24:59
So they sent their sister Rebekah on her way, along with her nurse and Abraham’s servant and his men.

## Genesis 24:60
And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, “Our sister, may you become thousands of ten thousands; may your descendants possess the gates of those who hate them.”

## Genesis 24:61
Then Rebekah and her attendants got ready and mounted the camels and followed the man. So the servant took Rebekah and departed.

## Genesis 24:62
Now Isaac had come from Beer Lahai Roi, for he was dwelling in the Negev.

## Genesis 24:63
He went out to the field one evening to meditate, and as he looked up, he saw camels approaching.

## Genesis 24:64
Rebekah also looked up and saw Isaac. She dismounted from her camel

## Genesis 24:65
and asked the servant, “Who is that man in the field coming to meet us?” The servant replied, “He is my master.” So she took her veil and covered herself.

## Genesis 24:66
Then the servant recounted to Isaac all he had done.

## Genesis 24:67
Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah, and he married Rebekah. She became his wife, and he loved her; and Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.
