The Lord said to Abram, “Leave your country, your relatives, and your father’s household, and go to the land I will show you.

## Genesis 12:2
I will make you a great nation, and I will bless you. I will make your name renowned, and you shall be a blessing.

## Genesis 12:3
I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse; and through you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.”

## Genesis 12:4
So Abram departed as the Lord had instructed him, and Lot accompanied him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he left Haran.

## Genesis 12:5
He took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, all their possessions they had gathered, and the people they had acquired in Haran, and they set out for Canaan. When they arrived in Canaan,

## Genesis 12:6
Abram journeyed through the land to the site of the great tree of Moreh at Shechem. During that period, the Canaanites inhabited the land.

## Genesis 12:7
The Lord appeared to Abram and said, “To your descendants I will give this land.” So he built an altar there to the Lord, who had revealed Himself to him.

## Genesis 12:8
From there, he moved on to the hill country east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. There he built an altar to the Lord and called upon the name of the Lord.

## Genesis 12:9
Then Abram set out and continued his journey towards the Negev.

## Genesis 12:10
There was a famine in the land, so Abram went down to Egypt to live there for a while, because the famine was severe.

## Genesis 12:11
As he was about to enter Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, “I know you are a beautiful woman.

## Genesis 12:12
When the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘This is his wife.’ Then they will kill me but let you live.

## Genesis 12:13
Please say you are my sister, so that I will be treated well for your sake and my life will be spared because of you.”

## Genesis 12:14
When Abram entered Egypt, the Egyptians saw that Sarai was very beautiful.

## Genesis 12:15
Pharaoh’s officials saw her and praised her to Pharaoh, and she was taken into his palace.

## Genesis 12:16
He treated Abram well for her sake, and Abram acquired sheep, oxen, male donkeys, male and female servants, female donkeys, and camels.

## Genesis 12:17
But the Lord afflicted Pharaoh and his household with serious plagues because of Sarai, Abram’s wife.

## Genesis 12:18
So Pharaoh summoned Abram and said, “What have you done to me? Why did you not tell me she was your wife?

## Genesis 12:19
Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her to be my wife? Now, here is your wife. Take her and go!”

## Genesis 12:20
Pharaoh gave orders concerning Abram to his men, and they sent him away with his wife and all that he had.
