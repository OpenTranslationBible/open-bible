# Genesis Chapter 49

## Genesis 49:1

Then Jacob summoned his sons and said,  
“Assemble yourselves, so that I may tell you what will happen to you in the days to come.

## Genesis 49:2

Gather together and listen, sons of Jacob;  
And listen to Israel your father.

## Genesis 49:3

Reuben, you are my firstborn,  
My might and the beginning of my strength,  
Preeminent in dignity and preeminent in power.

## Genesis 49:4

Uncontrollable as water, you shall not have preeminence,  
Because you went up to your father’s bed;  
Then you defiled it—he went up to my couch.

## Genesis 49:5

Simeon and Levi are brothers;  
Their swords are implements of violence.

## Genesis 49:6

May my soul not enter their council;  
May my glory not be united with their assembly,  
Because in their anger they killed men,  
And in their self-will they lamed oxen.

## Genesis 49:7

Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce;  
And their wrath, for it is cruel.  
I will disperse them in Jacob,  
And scatter them in Israel.

## Genesis 49:8

Judah, your brothers shall praise you;  
Your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies;  
Your father’s sons shall bow down to you.

## Genesis 49:9

Judah is a lion’s cub;  
From the prey, my son, you have gone up.  
He crouches, he lies down as a lion,  
And as a lion, who dares to stir him up?

## Genesis 49:10

The sceptre will not depart from Judah,  
Nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet,  
Until Shiloh comes,  
And to him shall be the obedience of the peoples.

## Genesis 49:11

He ties his foal to the vine,  
And his donkey’s colt to the choice vine;  
He washes his garments in wine,  
And his robes in the blood of grapes.

## Genesis 49:12

His eyes are dull from wine,  
And his teeth white from milk.

## Genesis 49:13

Zebulun will reside at the seashore;  
And he shall be a haven for ships,  
And his flank shall be toward Sidon.

## Genesis 49:14

Issachar is a strong donkey,  
Lying down between the sheepfolds.

## Genesis 49:15

When he saw that a resting place was good,  
And that the land was pleasant,  
He bowed his shoulder to carry burdens,  
And became a slave at forced labour.

## Genesis 49:16

Dan shall judge his people,  
As one of the tribes of Israel.

## Genesis 49:17

Dan shall be a serpent in the way,  
A viper on the path,  
That bites the horse’s heels,  
So that its rider falls backward.

## Genesis 49:18

For Your salvation I wait, Lord.

## Genesis 49:19

As for Gad, a band of raiders shall attack him,  
But he will attack at their heels.

## Genesis 49:20

As for Asher, his food shall be rich,  
And he will yield royal delicacies.

## Genesis 49:21

Naphtali is a doe let loose;  
He utters beautiful words.

## Genesis 49:22

Joseph is a fruitful branch,  
A fruitful branch by a spring;  
Its branches run over a wall.

## Genesis 49:23

The archers provoked him,  
And shot at him and harassed him;

## Genesis 49:24

But his bow remained firm,  
And his arms were agile,  
From the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob  
(From there is the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel),

## Genesis 49:25

From the God of your father who helps you,  
And by the Almighty who blesses you  
With blessings of heaven above,  
Blessings of the deep that lies beneath,  
Blessings of the breasts and of the womb.

## Genesis 49:26

The blessings of your father  
Have surpassed the blessings of my ancestors  
Up to the furthest boundary of the everlasting hills;  
May they be on the head of Joseph,  
And on the crown of the head of the one distinguished among his brothers.

## Genesis 49:27

Benjamin is a ravenous wolf;  
In the morning he devours the prey,  
And in the evening he divides the spoils.”

## Genesis 49:28

All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father said to them when he blessed them. He blessed them, every one with the blessing appropriate to him.

## Genesis 49:29

Then he commanded them and said to them, “I am about to be gathered to my people; bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,

## Genesis 49:30

In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is opposite Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought along with the field from Ephron the Hittite as a burial site.

## Genesis 49:31

There they buried Abraham and his wife Sarah, there they buried Isaac and his wife Rebekah, and there I buried Leah—

## Genesis 49:32

The field and the cave that is in it, purchased from the sons of Heth.”

## Genesis 49:33

When Jacob finished commanding his sons, he drew his feet into the bed and breathed his last, and was gathered to his people.
