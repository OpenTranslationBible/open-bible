# Genesis Chapter 1

## Genesis 1:1

In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.

## Genesis 1:2

Now the earth was a formless void, and darkness covered the surface of the deep, while the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.

## Genesis 1:3

And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.

## Genesis 1:4

God saw that the light was good, and He distinguished the light from the darkness.

## Genesis 1:5

God named the light “day,” and the darkness He named “night.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.

## Genesis 1:6

Then God said, “Let there be an expanse between the waters to separate water from water.”

## Genesis 1:7

So God made the expanse and separated the waters beneath it from the waters above it. And it was so.

## Genesis 1:8

God called the expanse “sky.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day.

## Genesis 1:9

And God said, “Let the waters under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear.” And it was so.

## Genesis 1:10

God named the dry ground “land,” and the gathered waters He named “seas.” And God observed that it was good.

## Genesis 1:11

Then God said, “Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, each according to its kind.” And it was so.

## Genesis 1:12

The land brought forth vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God observed that it was good.

## Genesis 1:13

And so, with evening and morning, there concluded the third day, .

## Genesis 1:14

And God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark sacred times, and for days and years,

## Genesis 1:15

and let them be lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth.” And it was so.

## Genesis 1:16

God fashioned two great lights—the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars.

## Genesis 1:17

God set them in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth,

## Genesis 1:18

to govern the day and the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God observed that it was good.

## Genesis 1:19

And so, with evening and morning, there concluded the fourth day.

## Genesis 1:20

And God said, “Let the waters teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky.”

## Genesis 1:21

So God created the great sea creatures and every living thing with which the waters teem and that moves about in it, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God observed that it was good.

## Genesis 1:22

God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let the birds multiply on the earth.”

## Genesis 1:23

And so, with evening and morning, there concluded the fifth day.

## Genesis 1:24

And God said, “Let the land bring forth living creatures according to their kinds: the livestock, the creatures that move along the ground, and the wild animals, each according to its kind.” And it was so.

## Genesis 1:25

God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God observed that it was good.

## Genesis 1:26

Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may have dominion over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.”

## Genesis 1:27

So God fashioned mankind in His own image, in the image of God He created them; male and female He created them.

## Genesis 1:28

God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Have dominion over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground.”

## Genesis 1:29

Then God said, “I provide you with every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food.

## Genesis 1:30

And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds in the sky and all the creatures that move along the ground—everything that has the breath of life in it—I provide every green plant for food.” And it was so.

## Genesis 1:31

God saw all that He had made, and it was exceedingly good. Thus concluded the sixth day, with evening and morning.
