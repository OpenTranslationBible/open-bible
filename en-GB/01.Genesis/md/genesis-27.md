# Genesis Chapter 27

## Genesis 27:1
When Isaac was old and his eyes were too dim to see, he called for Esau his elder son and said to him, “My son.” And he replied, “Here I am.”

## Genesis 27:2
Isaac said, “Behold, I am now old and do not know the day of my death.

## Genesis 27:3
Now then, take your gear, your quiver and bow, and go out to the open country to hunt some game for me.

## Genesis 27:4
Prepare a delicious meal for me, such as I love, and bring it to me to eat, so that I may bless you before I die.”

## Genesis 27:5
Now Rebekah was listening as Isaac spoke to his son Esau. So when Esau went to the field to hunt game to bring home,

## Genesis 27:6
Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “Behold, I overheard your father speak to your brother Esau, saying,

## Genesis 27:7
‘Bring me some game and prepare a delightful meal for me, so that I may eat and bless you in the presence of the Lord before my death.’

## Genesis 27:8
Now, my son, listen carefully to what I command you:

## Genesis 27:9
Go to the flock and bring me two choice young goats, so that I may prepare them as a delicious meal for your father, just the way he likes it.

## Genesis 27:10
Then take it to your father to eat, so that he may bless you before his death.”

## Genesis 27:11
Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “But my brother Esau is a hairy man while I have smooth skin.”

## Genesis 27:12
Perhaps my father will touch me, and I will seem to him like a deceiver, and I will bring upon myself a curse rather than a blessing.”

## Genesis 27:13
His mother said to him, “Your curse be on me, my son; only obey my voice and go, get them for me.”

## Genesis 27:14
So he went and got them and brought them to his mother, and she prepared a delicious meal, just the way his father loved.

## Genesis 27:15
Then Rebekah took the best garments of her elder son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them on her younger son Jacob.

## Genesis 27:16
She also covered his hands and the smooth part of his neck with the skins of the goats.

## Genesis 27:17
Then she handed to her son Jacob the delicious meal and the bread she had made.

## Genesis 27:18
He went to his father and said, “My father.” And he said, “Here I am. Who are you, my son?”

## Genesis 27:19
Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Please sit up and eat of my game, so that you may bless me.”

## Genesis 27:20
Isaac asked his son, “How did you find it so quickly, my son?” And he replied, “Because the Lord your God gave me success.”

## Genesis 27:21
Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Please come near, so that I may feel you, my son, to know whether you really are my son Esau or not.”

## Genesis 27:22
Jacob went close to his father Isaac, who touched him and said, “The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are those of Esau.”

## Genesis 27:23
He did not recognise him, for his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau; so he blessed him.

## Genesis 27:24
“Are you truly my son Esau?” he asked. “I am,” he replied.

## Genesis 27:25
Then he said, “Bring it to me, and I will eat of my son’s game, that I may bless you.” And he brought it to him, and he ate; he also brought him wine and he drank.

## Genesis 27:26
Then his father Isaac said to him, “Please come close and kiss me, my son.”

## Genesis 27:27
So he came close and kissed him; and when Isaac caught the smell of his garments, he blessed him and said, “See, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field which the Lord has blessed.

## Genesis 27:28
May God give you of the dew of heaven and the richness of the earth—an abundance of grain and new wine.

## Genesis 27:29
May nations serve you and peoples bow down to you. Be master over your brothers, and may your mother’s sons bow down to you. Cursed be those who curse you, and blessed be those who bless you.”

## Genesis 27:30
Now it came about, as soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob had scarcely left his father’s presence, that his brother Esau came in from his hunting.

## Genesis 27:31
He too prepared a delicious meal and brought it to his father. Then he said to him, “Let my father arise and eat of his son’s game, that you may bless me.”

## Genesis 27:32
His father Isaac asked him, “Who are you?” And he said, “I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.”

## Genesis 27:33
Then Isaac trembled violently and said, “Who then was it that hunted game and brought it to me? I ate it all before you came and I blessed him—and indeed he shall be blessed!”

## Genesis 27:34
When Esau heard his father’s words, he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry and said to his father, “Bless me, me as well, my father!”

## Genesis 27:35
But he said, “Your brother came deceitfully and has taken away your blessing.”

## Genesis 27:36
Esau said, “Is he not rightly named Jacob? For he has betrayed me these two times: He took away my birthright, and now he has taken away my blessing.” Then he asked, “Have you not reserved a blessing for me?”

## Genesis 27:37
Isaac replied to Esau, “Behold, I have made him your master, and I have given all his relatives as servants to him; and with grain and new wine I have sustained him. What then can I do for you, my son?”

## Genesis 27:38
Esau said to his father, “Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me, me as well, my father!” Then Esau raised his voice and wept.

## Genesis 27:39
His father Isaac answered him, “Behold, away from the richness of the earth shall be your dwelling, and away from the dew of heaven above.

## Genesis 27:40
By your sword you shall live, and you shall serve your brother. But when you grow restless, you will break his yoke from your neck.”

## Genesis 27:41
So Esau held a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him. Esau said to himself, “The days of mourning for my father are near; then I will kill my brother Jacob.”

## Genesis 27:42
When the words of her elder son Esau were reported to Rebekah, she sent for her younger son Jacob and said to him, “Behold, your brother Esau is consoling himself by planning to kill you.

## Genesis 27:43
Now then, my son, obey my voice and flee at once to my brother Laban in Haran.

## Genesis 27:44
Stay with him for a time until your brother’s anger subsides.

## Genesis 27:45
When your brother is no longer angry with you and forgets what you did to him, I will send word for you to come back from there. Why should I lose both of you in one day?”

## Genesis 27:46
And Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am tired of living because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob takes a wife from among the daughters of Heth, like these from the daughters of the land, what good will my life be to me?”
