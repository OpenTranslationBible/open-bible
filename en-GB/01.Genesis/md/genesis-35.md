# Genesis Chapter 35

## Genesis 35:1
Then God instructed Jacob, “Arise, go up to Bethel and reside there, and construct an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau.”

## Genesis 35:2
So Jacob told his household and all who were with him, “Remove the foreign gods that are among you, purify yourselves, and change your garments.”

## Genesis 35:3
“Let us arise and go up to Bethel, where I will build an altar to God, who answered me in my time of distress and has been with me wherever I have travelled.”

## Genesis 35:4
They handed over to Jacob all the foreign gods they possessed and the rings in their ears, and Jacob buried them beneath the oak near Shechem.

## Genesis 35:5
As they journeyed, a great terror from God fell upon the towns surrounding them, so no one pursued the sons of Jacob.

## Genesis 35:6
Jacob and all the people with him arrived at Luz (that is, Bethel) in the land of Canaan.

## Genesis 35:7
He built an altar there and named the place El-bethel, because it was there that God had revealed Himself to him when he fled from his brother.

## Genesis 35:8
Now Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, passed away and was buried beneath the oak below Bethel; it was named Allon-bacuth.

## Genesis 35:9
God once more revealed Himself to Jacob after his return from Paddan-aram, and He blessed him.

## Genesis 35:10
God said to him, “Your name is Jacob, but you shall no longer be called Jacob; Israel shall be your name.” Thus He named him Israel.

## Genesis 35:11
God also said to him, “I am God Almighty; be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a multitude of nations shall come from you, and kings shall emerge from you.”

## Genesis 35:12
“The land I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you, and I will grant this land to your descendants after you.”

## Genesis 35:13
Then God departed from him at the place where He had spoken with him.

## Genesis 35:14
Jacob set up a stone pillar at the place where God had spoken with him, and he poured out a drink offering on it and also poured oil on it.

## Genesis 35:15
Jacob called the place where God had spoken with him Bethel.

## Genesis 35:16
Then they departed from Bethel. When they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel went into labour and experienced severe difficulties.

## Genesis 35:17
During her intense labour, the midwife said to her, “Do not fear, for you have another son.”

## Genesis 35:18
As she breathed her last—for she was dying—she named her son Ben-oni, but his father called him Benjamin.

## Genesis 35:19
So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).

## Genesis 35:20
Jacob set up a pillar over her grave; it is the pillar of Rachel’s grave to this day.

## Genesis 35:21
Israel journeyed on and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder.

## Genesis 35:22
While Israel was residing in that land, Reuben went and lay with his father’s concubine Bilhah, and Israel heard of it. Now Jacob had twelve sons:

## Genesis 35:23
Leah's sons were Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn, and Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.

## Genesis 35:24
The sons of Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin.

## Genesis 35:25
The sons of Rachel’s maidservant Bilhah were Dan and Naphtali.

## Genesis 35:26
The sons of Leah’s maidservant Zilpah were Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob, born to him in Paddan-aram.

## Genesis 35:27
Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre, near Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had stayed.

## Genesis 35:28
Isaac reached the age of one hundred and eighty years.

## Genesis 35:29
Then he breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people, old and full of years. His sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
