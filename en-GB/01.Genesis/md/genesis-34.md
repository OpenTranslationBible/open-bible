# Genesis Chapter 34

## Genesis 34:1

Dinah, the daughter of Leah, whom she had borne to Jacob, went out to visit the daughters of the land.

## Genesis 34:2

When Shechem, the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her, he took her and lay with her, violating her.

## Genesis 34:3

His heart was drawn to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the young woman and spoke tenderly to her.

## Genesis 34:4

So Shechem said to his father Hamor, “Get me this young woman as my wife.”

## Genesis 34:5

When Jacob heard that his daughter Dinah had been defiled, his sons were with his livestock in the fields, so he held his peace until they returned.

## Genesis 34:6

Then Hamor, the father of Shechem, went out to speak with Jacob.

## Genesis 34:7

Now Jacob’s sons came in from the fields when they heard about it; they were grieved and very angry, because Shechem had done a disgraceful thing in Israel by lying with Jacob’s daughter—a thing that ought not to be done.

## Genesis 34:8

But Hamor spoke with them, saying, “The soul of my son Shechem longs for your daughter. Please give her to him as his wife.

## Genesis 34:9

Intermarry with us; give your daughters to us and take our daughters for yourselves.

## Genesis 34:10

You can live among us; the land is open to you. Dwell in it, trade in it, and acquire property in it.”

## Genesis 34:11

Shechem addressed Dinah’s father and brothers, “Grant me favour in your eyes, and I will give you whatever you ask.

## Genesis 34:12

Set the bridal price and gift as high as you like, and I will pay whatever you ask me. Only give me the young woman as my wife.”

## Genesis 34:13

Jacob’s sons answered Shechem and his father Hamor deceitfully, because he had defiled their sister Dinah.

## Genesis 34:14

They said to them, “We cannot do such a thing—to give our sister to a man who is uncircumcised would be a disgrace to us.

## Genesis 34:15

We will consent to you only on this condition: that you become like us by circumcising all your males.

## Genesis 34:16

Then we will give you our daughters and take your daughters for ourselves. We will dwell among you and become one people.

## Genesis 34:17

But if you will not agree to be circumcised, we will take our sister and go.”

## Genesis 34:18

Hamor and his son Shechem found the proposal agreeable.

## Genesis 34:19

The young man, who was more respected than all his father’s household, did not delay in doing what they said, because he was delighted with Jacob’s daughter.

## Genesis 34:20

So Hamor and his son Shechem went to the city gate to speak to the men of their city.

## Genesis 34:21

“These men are friendly with us,” they said. “Let them dwell in the land and trade in it; the land is large enough for them. We can take their daughters as wives and give our daughters to them.

## Genesis 34:22

But the men will consent to live with us as one people only on the condition that every male among us is circumcised, as they are.

## Genesis 34:23

Will not their livestock, their property and all their animals become ours? Let us agree to their terms, and they will settle among us.”

## Genesis 34:24

All who went out of the city gate agreed with Hamor and his son Shechem, and every male in the city was circumcised.

## Genesis 34:25

Three days later, while they were still in pain, two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, took their swords and attacked the unsuspecting city, killing every male.

## Genesis 34:26

They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with the sword and took Dinah from Shechem’s house and departed.

## Genesis 34:27

Jacob’s sons came upon the slain and looted the city, because their sister had been defiled.

## Genesis 34:28

They seized their flocks and herds and donkeys and everything else of theirs in the city and in the fields.

## Genesis 34:29

They carried off all their wealth and all their little ones and their wives, taking as plunder everything in the houses.

## Genesis 34:30

Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have brought trouble on me by making me obnoxious to the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites and Perizzites. We are few in number, and if they join forces against me and attack me, I and my household will be destroyed.”

## Genesis 34:31

But they replied, “Should he have treated our sister with such gross dishonour?”
