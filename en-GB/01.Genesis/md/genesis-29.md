# Genesis Chapter 29

## Genesis 29:1
Jacob continued his journey and arrived in the land of the eastern people.

## Genesis 29:2
He noticed a well in the field, with three flocks of sheep lying nearby, as the flocks were watered from that well. The stone covering the well's mouth was large.

## Genesis 29:3
When all the flocks were gathered, the shepherds would roll the stone away from the well's mouth and water the sheep, then replace the stone over the well's mouth.

## Genesis 29:4
Jacob asked the shepherds, “My brothers, where do you come from?” They replied, “We are from Haran.”

## Genesis 29:5
He asked them, “Do you know Laban, the grandson of Nahor?” They answered, “We know him.”

## Genesis 29:6
Jacob inquired further, “Is he well?” They said, “Yes, he is well, and here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep.”

## Genesis 29:7
Jacob said, “Look, it is still broad daylight; it is not yet time to gather the livestock. Water the sheep and take them back to pasture.”

## Genesis 29:8
But they replied, “We cannot do so until all the flocks are gathered and the stone is rolled away from the well's mouth; then we will water the sheep.”

## Genesis 29:9
While he was still speaking with them, Rachel arrived with her father's sheep, for she was a shepherdess.

## Genesis 29:10
When Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of his uncle Laban, and Laban’s sheep, he approached and rolled the stone away from the well's mouth and watered his uncle’s sheep.

## Genesis 29:11
Then Jacob kissed Rachel and wept aloud.

## Genesis 29:12
Jacob explained to Rachel that he was a relative of her father and a son of Rebekah. She ran and informed her father.

## Genesis 29:13
When Laban heard the news about Jacob, his sister’s son, he hurried to meet him. He embraced him, kissed him, and brought him to his home, where Jacob recounted all these events.

## Genesis 29:14
Laban said to him, “Surely you are my own flesh and blood.” And Jacob stayed with him for a month.

## Genesis 29:15
Then Laban said to Jacob, “Because you are my relative, should you work for me for nothing? Tell me what your wages should be.”

## Genesis 29:16
Laban had two daughters; the elder was named Leah, and the younger was named Rachel.

## Genesis 29:17
Leah had gentle eyes, while Rachel was lovely in form and appearance.

## Genesis 29:18
Jacob was in love with Rachel and said, “I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel.”

## Genesis 29:19
Laban replied, “It is better that I give her to you than to another man. Stay here with me.”

## Genesis 29:20
Jacob served seven years for Rachel, but they seemed like only a few days to him because of his love for her.

## Genesis 29:21
Then Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife, for my time is fulfilled, that I may be with her.”

## Genesis 29:22
So Laban gathered the people of the place and prepared a feast.

## Genesis 29:23
But when evening came, he took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob, and Jacob was with her.

## Genesis 29:24
Laban gave his servant Zilpah to his daughter Leah as her maid.

## Genesis 29:25
When morning came, there was Leah! So Jacob said to Laban, “What have you done to me? Was it not for Rachel that I served you? Why have you tricked me?”

## Genesis 29:26
Laban said, “It is not our custom here to give the younger daughter in marriage before the elder one.

## Genesis 29:27
Complete this one's bridal week, and we will give you the other also, in return for another seven years of work.”

## Genesis 29:28
Jacob did so. He completed the week with Leah, and then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel as his wife.

## Genesis 29:29
Laban gave his servant Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her maid.

## Genesis 29:30
Jacob was also with Rachel, and he loved Rachel more than Leah. He worked for Laban another seven years.

## Genesis 29:31
When the Lord saw that Leah was unloved, he enabled her to conceive, but Rachel remained childless.

## Genesis 29:32
Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Reuben, for she said, “The Lord has seen my misery. Surely my husband will love me now.”

## Genesis 29:33
She conceived again and gave birth to a son, saying, “Because the Lord heard that I am unloved, he has given me this one too.” So she named him Simeon.

## Genesis 29:34
She conceived again and gave birth to a son, saying, “Now at last my husband will become attached to me, because I have borne him three sons.” So he was named Levi.

## Genesis 29:35
She conceived again and gave birth to a son, saying, “This time I will praise the Lord.” So she named him Judah. Then she stopped having children.
