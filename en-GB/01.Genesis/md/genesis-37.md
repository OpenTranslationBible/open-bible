# Genesis Chapter 37

## Genesis 37:1
Jacob dwelt in the land where his father had resided as a foreigner, in the land of Canaan.

## Genesis 37:2
These are the records of Jacob’s family line. Joseph, at the age of seventeen, was shepherding the flock with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father’s wives. Joseph brought a bad report about them to their father.

## Genesis 37:3
Israel loved Joseph more than all his other sons, as he was the son of his old age; and he made him a coat of many colours.

## Genesis 37:4
When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all of them, they hated him and could not speak to him in friendly terms.

## Genesis 37:5
Joseph had a dream, and when he recounted it to his brothers, they hated him even more.

## Genesis 37:6
He said to them, “Please listen to this dream I have had:

## Genesis 37:7
We were binding sheaves in the field, and suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright, while your sheaves gathered around and bowed down to my sheaf.”

## Genesis 37:8
His brothers said to him, “Do you really think you will reign over us? Will you indeed rule over us?” So they hated him even more for his dreams and his words.

## Genesis 37:9
Then he had another dream and told it to his brothers. “Listen,” he said, “I have had another dream, and this time the sun, the moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to me.”

## Genesis 37:10
When he told his father and his brothers, his father rebuked him and said, “What is this dream you have had? Shall your mother and I and your brothers actually come to bow down to the ground before you?”

## Genesis 37:11
His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind.

## Genesis 37:12
His brothers went to graze their father’s flock near Shechem.

## Genesis 37:13
Israel said to Joseph, “Are your brothers not grazing the flock near Shechem? Come, I will send you to them.” Joseph replied, “I will go.”

## Genesis 37:14
He said to him, “Go now and see if it is well with your brothers and with the flock, and bring word back to me.” So he sent him from the Valley of Hebron, and he arrived at Shechem.

## Genesis 37:15
A man found him wandering in the fields and asked him, “What are you looking for?”

## Genesis 37:16
He replied, “I am looking for my brothers; can you tell me where they are grazing the flock?”

## Genesis 37:17
The man said, “They have moved on from here; I heard them say, ‘Let’s go to Dothan.’” So Joseph went after his brothers and found them at Dothan.

## Genesis 37:18
When they saw him from a distance, before he reached them, they plotted to kill him.

## Genesis 37:19
They said to each other, “Here comes this dreamer!

## Genesis 37:20
Come now, let’s kill him and throw him into one of these pits; we can say a wild animal devoured him. Then we will see what becomes of his dreams.”

## Genesis 37:21
But Reuben heard this and tried to save him from their hands. “Let’s not take his life,” he said.

## Genesis 37:22
“Do not shed blood. Throw him into this pit here in the wilderness, but do not lay a hand on him.” Reuben said this to rescue him from them and return him to his father.

## Genesis 37:23
When Joseph reached his brothers, they stripped him of his coat, the coat of many colours he was wearing.

## Genesis 37:24
They took him and threw him into the pit. The pit was empty, without water.

## Genesis 37:25
As they sat down to eat a meal, they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead, with their camels carrying spices, balm, and myrrh, on their way to Egypt.

## Genesis 37:26
Judah said to his brothers, “What profit is there if we kill our brother and cover up his blood?

## Genesis 37:27
Come, let’s sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay our hands on him; for he is our brother, our own flesh.” His brothers agreed.

## Genesis 37:28
When the Midianite traders passed by, they pulled Joseph out of the pit and sold him for twenty shekels of silver to the Ishmaelites, who took him to Egypt.

## Genesis 37:29
When Reuben returned to the pit and saw that Joseph was not there, he tore his garments.

## Genesis 37:30
He returned to his brothers and said, “The boy is not there! Where can I go now?”

## Genesis 37:31
They took Joseph’s coat, slaughtered a goat, and dipped the coat in the blood.

## Genesis 37:32
They brought the coat of many colours to their father and said, “We found this. Examine it to see whether it is your son’s coat.”

## Genesis 37:33
He recognised it and said, “It is my son’s coat! A wild animal has devoured him. Joseph has surely been torn to pieces.”

## Genesis 37:34
Jacob tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, and mourned for his son for many days.

## Genesis 37:35
All his sons and daughters came to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. “No,” he said, “I will go down to the grave mourning for my son.” So his father wept for him.

## Genesis 37:36
In Egypt, the Midianites sold Joseph to Potiphar, a high-ranking official of Pharaoh, who was the captain of the guard.
