# Genesis Chapter 39

## Genesis 39:1
Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt, and Potiphar, an Egyptian officer of Pharaoh and captain of the guard, purchased him from the Ishmaelites who had brought him there.

## Genesis 39:2
The Lord was with Joseph, and he became a prosperous man, living in the house of his Egyptian master.

## Genesis 39:3
His master observed that the Lord was with him and that the Lord granted success to everything he undertook.

## Genesis 39:4
Joseph gained favour in his master's sight and became his personal attendant. Potiphar appointed him over his household, entrusting him with all he possessed.

## Genesis 39:5
From the time he made him overseer of his house and all he owned, the Lord blessed the Egyptian's household for Joseph's sake. The Lord's blessing was on everything he had, both in the house and in the fields.

## Genesis 39:6
So Potiphar left everything he had in Joseph's care, and with Joseph in charge, he concerned himself only with the food he ate. Now Joseph was handsome in form and appearance.

## Genesis 39:7
After some time, his master's wife took notice of Joseph and said, “Lie with me.”

## Genesis 39:8
But he refused and said to his master's wife, “With me in charge, my master does not concern himself with anything in the house; he has entrusted everything he owns to my care.

## Genesis 39:9
There is no one greater in this house than I am. My master has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How then could I do such a wicked thing and sin against God?”

## Genesis 39:10
Though she spoke to Joseph day after day, he did not heed her request to lie beside her or to be with her.

## Genesis 39:11
One day he went into the house to perform his duties, and none of the household servants was present.

## Genesis 39:12
She caught him by his garment and said, “Lie with me!” But he left his garment in her hand and fled outside.

## Genesis 39:13
When she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled outside,

## Genesis 39:14
she called to her household servants and said, “Look, this Hebrew has been brought to us to mock us! He came in to lie with me, but I screamed.

## Genesis 39:15
When he heard me raise my voice and scream, he left his garment beside me and fled outside.”

## Genesis 39:16
She kept his garment beside her until his master returned home.

## Genesis 39:17
Then she recounted the incident to him, saying, “The Hebrew slave you brought us came to me to mock me.

## Genesis 39:18
But as soon as I raised my voice and screamed, he left his garment beside me and fled outside.”

## Genesis 39:19
When his master heard the story his wife told him, saying, “This is what your slave did to me,” he was furious.

## Genesis 39:20
Joseph's master took him and placed him in the prison where the king's prisoners were confined. And he remained there in the prison.

## Genesis 39:21
But the Lord was with Joseph, showing him steadfast love and granting him favour in the sight of the prison warden.

## Genesis 39:22
The warden put Joseph in charge of all the prisoners held there, and he was responsible for all that was done in the prison.

## Genesis 39:23
The warden paid no attention to anything under Joseph's charge, because the Lord was with him and made whatever he did prosper.
