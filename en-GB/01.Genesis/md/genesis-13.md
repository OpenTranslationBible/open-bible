# Genesis Chapter 13

## Genesis 13:1
So Abram went up from Egypt to the Negev, with his wife and all his possessions, and Lot went with him.

## Genesis 13:2
Abram was very wealthy in livestock, silver, and gold.

## Genesis 13:3
He journeyed from the Negev as far as Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the start, between Bethel and Ai,

## Genesis 13:4
to the site of the altar he had made there before; and there Abram called upon the name of the Lord.

## Genesis 13:5
Lot, who travelled with Abram, also had flocks, herds, and tents.

## Genesis 13:6
But the land could not support them while they stayed together, for their possessions were so numerous that they could not remain together.

## Genesis 13:7
And there was conflict between the herdsmen of Abram’s livestock and those of Lot. At that time the Canaanites and Perizzites were dwelling in the land.

## Genesis 13:8
So Abram said to Lot, “Let there be no conflict between you and me, or between my herdsmen and yours, for we are kinsmen.

## Genesis 13:9
Is not the whole land before you? Please part from me; if you go to the left, I will go to the right; or if you go to the right, I will go to the left.”

## Genesis 13:10
Lot looked up and saw that the whole plain of the Jordan was well watered everywhere, like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt, as you go to Zoar. (This was before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.)

## Genesis 13:11
So Lot chose for himself the entire plain of the Jordan, and set out eastward. Thus they parted company.

## Genesis 13:12
Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, while Lot dwelt among the cities of the plain and pitched his tents near Sodom.

## Genesis 13:13
Now the people of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinned greatly against the Lord.

## Genesis 13:14
The Lord said to Abram, after Lot had parted from him, “Lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are, northward and southward, eastward and westward;

## Genesis 13:15
for all the land that you see I will give to you and your descendants forever.

## Genesis 13:16
I will make your descendants as numerous as the dust of the earth, so that if anyone could count the dust, then your descendants could also be counted.

## Genesis 13:17
Arise, walk through the land in its length and breadth, for I will give it to you.”

## Genesis 13:18
So Abram moved his tent and came and settled by the great trees of Mamre, which are in Hebron; and there he built an altar to the Lord.
