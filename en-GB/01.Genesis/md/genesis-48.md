# Genesis Chapter 48

## Genesis 48:1
After these events, Joseph was informed, “Your father is unwell.” So he took his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, with him.

## Genesis 48:2
When Jacob was told, “Your son Joseph has come to you,” Israel gathered his strength and sat up in bed.

## Genesis 48:3
Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me,

## Genesis 48:4
saying to me, ‘I will make you fruitful and multiply your descendants. I will make you a multitude of peoples, and I will give this land to your descendants as an everlasting possession.’

## Genesis 48:5
“Now your two sons, born to you in Egypt before I arrived here, will be considered as mine; Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine, just as Reuben and Simeon are.

## Genesis 48:6
Any offspring born to you after them will be yours; they will be recorded under the names of their brothers in their inheritance.

## Genesis 48:7
As I was returning from Paddan, Rachel died in the land of Canaan, to my sorrow, while we were still on the journey, a little distance from Ephrath. So I buried her there on the way to Ephrath” (that is, Bethlehem).

## Genesis 48:8
When Israel saw Joseph’s sons, he asked, “Who are these?”

## Genesis 48:9
Joseph said to his father, “They are my sons, whom God has given me here.” Then Israel said, “Bring them to me, please, so that I may bless them.”

## Genesis 48:10
Now Israel’s eyes were failing due to old age, and he could hardly see. So Joseph brought them near, and his father kissed and embraced them.

## Genesis 48:11
Israel said to Joseph, “I never expected to see your face again, and now God has allowed me to see your children too.”

## Genesis 48:12
Then Joseph removed them from Israel’s knees and bowed down with his face to the ground.

## Genesis 48:13
Joseph took both of them, Ephraim with his right hand towards Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh with his left hand towards Israel’s right hand, and brought them close to him.

## Genesis 48:14
But Israel stretched out his right hand and placed it on Ephraim’s head, who was the younger, and crossing his arms, he placed his left hand on Manasseh’s head, even though Manasseh was the firstborn.

## Genesis 48:15
Then he blessed Joseph and said, “The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has been my shepherd all my life to this day,

## Genesis 48:16
the angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the boys. May my name be perpetuated in them, and the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and may they grow into a multitude on the earth.”

## Genesis 48:17
When Joseph saw his father placing his right hand on Ephraim’s head, it displeased him; so he took hold of his father’s hand to move it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head.

## Genesis 48:18
Joseph said to his father, “Not so, my father, for this one is the firstborn. Place your right hand on his head.”

## Genesis 48:19
But his father refused and said, “I know, my son, I know. He too will become a people, and he too will be great. However, his younger brother will be greater than he, and his descendants will become a multitude of nations.”

## Genesis 48:20
He blessed them that day, saying, “By you Israel will pronounce blessings, saying, ‘May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.’” Thus he put Ephraim before Manasseh.

## Genesis 48:21
Then Israel said to Joseph, “I am about to die, but God will be with you and will bring you back to the land of your fathers.

## Genesis 48:22
And I give you one portion more than your brothers, which I took from the Amorites with my sword and my bow.”
