# Genesis Chapter 32

## Genesis 32:1
As Jacob continued on his journey, the angels of God encountered him.

## Genesis 32:2
Upon seeing them, Jacob declared, “This is the camp of God!” Thus, he named the place Mahanaim.

## Genesis 32:3
Jacob dispatched messengers ahead to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the region of Edom.

## Genesis 32:4
He instructed them, “This is what you are to say to my lord Esau: ‘Your servant Jacob reports: I have been residing with Laban and have stayed until now.

## Genesis 32:5
I possess oxen, donkeys, flocks, and male and female servants. I am sending this message to my lord, hoping to find favour in your sight.’”

## Genesis 32:6
The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, “We went to your brother Esau, and he is coming to meet you with four hundred men.”

## Genesis 32:7
Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed, so he divided the people with him, along with the flocks, herds, and camels, into two groups.

## Genesis 32:8
He reasoned, “If Esau attacks one group, the other group may escape.”

## Genesis 32:9
Jacob prayed, “O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, Lord, you who told me, ‘Return to your homeland and relatives, and I will make you prosper,’

## Genesis 32:10
I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness you have shown your servant. I crossed this Jordan with only my staff, and now I have become two camps.

## Genesis 32:11
Please deliver me from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid he will attack me, as well as the mothers with their children.

## Genesis 32:12
Yet you have promised, ‘I will surely make you prosper and make your descendants as numerous as the sand of the sea, which cannot be counted.’”

## Genesis 32:13
He spent the night there and selected a gift for his brother Esau from what he had with him:

## Genesis 32:14
two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,

## Genesis 32:15
thirty milking camels with their young, forty cows and ten bulls, and twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.

## Genesis 32:16
He placed them under the care of his servants, each herd by itself, and instructed them, “Go ahead of me and keep some distance between the herds.”

## Genesis 32:17
He directed the one leading, “When my brother Esau meets you and asks, ‘To whom do you belong, and where are you going, and who owns all these animals in front of you?’

## Genesis 32:18
you are to reply, ‘They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift sent to my lord Esau, and he is following us.’”

## Genesis 32:19
He instructed the second, the third, and all who followed the herds, “You are to say the same thing to Esau when you meet him.

## Genesis 32:20
And be sure to say, ‘Your servant Jacob is coming behind us.’” For he thought, “I will appease him with these gifts I am sending ahead; afterward, when I see him, perhaps he will accept me.”

## Genesis 32:21
So Jacob’s gifts went ahead of him, while he stayed in the camp that night.

## Genesis 32:22
That night Jacob arose, took his two wives, his two female servants, and his eleven sons, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.

## Genesis 32:23
Once he had sent them across the stream, he also sent over all his belongings.

## Genesis 32:24
Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him until daybreak.

## Genesis 32:25
When the man realized he could not prevail against him, he touched the socket of Jacob’s hip, causing it to be wrenched as they wrestled.

## Genesis 32:26
Then the man said, “Let me go, for it is daybreak.” But Jacob replied, “I will not release you unless you bless me.”

## Genesis 32:27
The man asked him, “What is your name?” “Jacob,” he replied.

## Genesis 32:28
Then the man said, “Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with men and have prevailed.”

## Genesis 32:29
Jacob said, “Please tell me your name.” But he replied, “Why do you ask my name?” And he blessed him there.

## Genesis 32:30
So Jacob named the place Peniel, saying, “It is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared.”

## Genesis 32:31
The sun rose upon him as he passed Peniel, and he was limping because of his hip.

## Genesis 32:32
For this reason, to this day, the Israelites refrain from eating the tendon attached to the hip socket, because Jacob’s hip was touched near the tendon.
