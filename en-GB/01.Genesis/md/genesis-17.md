# Genesis Chapter 17

## Genesis 17:1
When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the Lord appeared to him and said, “I am God Almighty; walk before Me and be blameless.

## Genesis 17:2
I will establish My covenant between Me and you, and I will multiply your descendants greatly.”

## Genesis 17:3
Abram fell on his face, and God spoke with him, saying,

## Genesis 17:4
“As for Me, this is My covenant with you: You shall be the father of a multitude of nations.

## Genesis 17:5
No longer shall your name be Abram, but your name shall be Abraham, for I have made you the father of many nations.

## Genesis 17:6
I will make you exceedingly fruitful; I will make nations of you, and kings shall come from you.

## Genesis 17:7
I will establish My covenant as an everlasting covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you throughout their generations, to be your God and the God of your descendants after you.

## Genesis 17:8
I will give to you and your descendants after you the land where you are residing as a foreigner, all the land of Canaan, as an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.”

## Genesis 17:9
God said further to Abraham, “As for you, you shall keep My covenant, you and your descendants after you throughout their generations.

## Genesis 17:10
This is My covenant which you shall keep, between Me and you and your descendants after you: every male among you shall be circumcised.

## Genesis 17:11
You shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin, and it shall be the sign of the covenant between Me and you.

## Genesis 17:12
Every male among you who is eight days old shall be circumcised throughout your generations, including those born in your house or bought with money from any foreigner, who are not your descendants.

## Genesis 17:13
A slave born in your house or bought with your money shall be circumcised. Thus My covenant shall be in your flesh as an everlasting covenant.

## Genesis 17:14
Any uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin shall be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant.”

## Genesis 17:15
Then God said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her Sarai, but Sarah shall be her name.

## Genesis 17:16
I will bless her, and indeed I will give you a son by her. I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of peoples shall come from her.”

## Genesis 17:17
Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said in his heart, “Shall a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old? And shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?”

## Genesis 17:18
And Abraham said to God, “Oh that Ishmael might live under Your blessing!”

## Genesis 17:19
But God said, “No, but your wife Sarah shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name Isaac; and I will establish My covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him.

## Genesis 17:20
As for Ishmael, I have heard you; I will bless him and make him fruitful and multiply him greatly. He shall father twelve princes, and I will make him into a great nation.

## Genesis 17:21
But I will establish My covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear to you at this time next year.”

## Genesis 17:22
When He had finished speaking with Abraham, God went up from him.

## Genesis 17:23
Then Abraham took his son Ishmael and all those born in his house or bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s household, and circumcised them on that very day, as God had instructed him.

## Genesis 17:24
Now Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.

## Genesis 17:25
And his son Ishmael was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.

## Genesis 17:26
On that very day Abraham and his son Ishmael were circumcised.

## Genesis 17:27
And all the men of his household, those born in the house or bought with money from a foreigner, were circumcised with him.
