# Genesis Chapter 43

## Genesis 43:1

Now the famine was severe in the land.

## Genesis 43:2

So it came about, when they had finished eating the grain which they had brought from Egypt, that their father said to them, “Go back, buy us a little food.”

## Genesis 43:3

But Judah spoke to him, saying, “The man explicitly warned us, saying, ‘You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.’

## Genesis 43:4

If you send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you food.

## Genesis 43:5

But if you do not send him, we will not go down; for the man said to us, ‘You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.’”

## Genesis 43:6

Then Israel said, “Why did you treat me so badly, by telling the man whether you still had another brother?”

## Genesis 43:7

But they said, “The man specifically asked about us and our relatives, saying, ‘Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?’ So we answered his questions. Could we possibly have known that he would say, ‘Bring your brother down’?”

## Genesis 43:8

Then Judah said to his father Israel, “Send the boy with me and we will arise and go, so that we may live and not die—we as well as you and our little ones.

## Genesis 43:9

I myself will take responsibility for him! You may demand him back from me. If I do not bring him back to you and present him to you, then you can let me take the blame forever.

## Genesis 43:10

For if we had not delayed, we could have returned twice by now.”

## Genesis 43:11

Then their father Israel said to them, “If it must be so, then do this: take some of the best products of the land in your bags, and bring the man a gift—a little balsam and a little honey, labdanum resin and myrrh, pistachio nuts and almonds.

## Genesis 43:12

And take double the money in your hand, and take back in your hand the money that was returned in the opening of your sacks; perhaps it was a mistake.

## Genesis 43:13

Take your brother also, and arise, return to the man;

## Genesis 43:14

And may God Almighty grant you compassion in the sight of the man, so that he will release to you your other brother and Benjamin.  
And as for me, if I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved!”

## Genesis 43:15

So the men took this gift, and they took double the money in their hand, and Benjamin; then they set out and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.

## Genesis 43:16

When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to his house steward, “Bring the men into the house, and slaughter an animal and prepare it; for the men are to dine with me at noon.”

## Genesis 43:17

So the man did as Joseph said, and brought the men to Joseph’s house.

## Genesis 43:18

Now the men were afraid, because they had been brought to Joseph’s house; and they said, “It is because of the money that was returned in our sacks the first time that we are being brought in, so that he may attack us and overpower us, and take us as slaves with our donkeys.”

## Genesis 43:19

So they approached Joseph’s house steward, and spoke to him at the entrance of the house,

## Genesis 43:20

And said, “Oh, my lord, we indeed came down the first time to buy food;

## Genesis 43:21

But it happened that when we came to the overnight campsite, we opened our sacks, and behold, each man’s money was in the opening of his sack, our money in full. So we have brought it back in our hand.

## Genesis 43:22

We have also brought down other money in our hand to buy food. We do not know who put our money in our sacks.”

## Genesis 43:23

But he said, “Peace to you, do not be afraid. Your God and the God of your father has given you treasure in your sacks; your money was in fact received.”  
Then he brought Simeon out to them.

## Genesis 43:24

Then the man brought the men into Joseph’s house and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their donkeys feed.

## Genesis 43:25

So they prepared the gift for Joseph’s arrival at noon; for they had heard that they were to eat a meal there.

## Genesis 43:26

When Joseph came into the house, they brought him the gift which was in their hand into the house, and bowed to the ground before him.

## Genesis 43:27

Then he asked them about their welfare, and said, “Is your old father well, of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?”

## Genesis 43:28

And they said, “Your servant our father is well; he is still alive.”  
Then they bowed down again in homage.

## Genesis 43:29

And as he raised his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son, he said, “Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me?”  
Then he said, “May God be gracious to you, my son.”

## Genesis 43:30

Joseph hurried out, for he was deeply stirred over his brother, and he looked for a place to weep; so he entered his chamber and wept there.

## Genesis 43:31

Then he washed his face and came out; and he controlled himself and said, “Serve the meal.”

## Genesis 43:32

Then they served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians could not eat bread with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.

## Genesis 43:33

Now they were seated before him, the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth, and the men looked at one another in astonishment.

## Genesis 43:34

He took portions to them from his own table, but Benjamin’s portion was five times as much as any of theirs.  
So they drank freely with him.
