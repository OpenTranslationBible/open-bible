# Genesis Chapter 43

## Genesis 43:1
The famine continued to be severe in the land.

## Genesis 43:2
When they had consumed all the grain they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, “Return and purchase a little more food for us.”

## Genesis 43:3
Judah replied to him, “The man sternly warned us, ‘You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.’

## Genesis 43:4
If you allow our brother to accompany us, we will go down and buy food for you.

## Genesis 43:5
But if you do not send him, we will not go down, for the man said to us, ‘You shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.’”

## Genesis 43:6
Israel asked, “Why did you bring this trouble upon me by telling the man you had another brother?”

## Genesis 43:7
They said, “The man questioned us closely about ourselves and our family, asking, ‘Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?’ We answered his questions. How could we have known he would say, ‘Bring your brother down here’?”

## Genesis 43:8
Then Judah said to his father Israel, “Send the boy with me, and we will set out at once, so that we, you, and our children may live and not die.

## Genesis 43:9
I will personally vouch for his safety; you may hold me accountable. If I do not bring him back and present him to you, I will bear the blame forever.

## Genesis 43:10
If we had not delayed, we could have gone and returned twice by now.”

## Genesis 43:11
Then their father Israel said, “If it must be so, then do this: take some of the best products of the land in your bags and carry them down to the man as a gift—a little balm, a little honey, some spices and myrrh, pistachio nuts, and almonds.

## Genesis 43:12
Take double the money with you, and return the money that was placed back in the mouths of your sacks. Perhaps it was an oversight.

## Genesis 43:13
Take your brother as well, and return to the man without delay.

## Genesis 43:14
And may God Almighty grant you compassion in the sight of the man, so that he will release your other brother and Benjamin to you. As for me, if I am bereaved, I am bereaved.”

## Genesis 43:15
So the men took the gifts and double the money, and Benjamin also. They hurried down to Egypt and stood before Joseph.

## Genesis 43:16
When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, “Take these men to my house, slaughter an animal, and prepare a meal; they are to dine with me at noon.”

## Genesis 43:17
The steward did as Joseph instructed and brought the men to Joseph’s house.

## Genesis 43:18
The men were afraid when they were brought to Joseph’s house. They thought, “We are brought here because of the money that was returned in our sacks the first time. He intends to attack us, overpower us, and seize us as slaves, along with our donkeys.”

## Genesis 43:19
So they approached Joseph’s steward and spoke to him at the entrance of the house.

## Genesis 43:20
They said, “Pardon us, my lord, we indeed came down here the first time to buy food.

## Genesis 43:21
But when we reached our campsite, we opened our sacks and found each man’s money in the mouth of his sack—our money in full. So we have brought it back with us.

## Genesis 43:22
We have also brought additional money with us to buy food. We do not know who put our money in our sacks.”

## Genesis 43:23
The steward said, “Peace be with you; do not be afraid. Your God and the God of your father has given you treasure in your sacks; I received your money.” Then he brought Simeon out to them.

## Genesis 43:24
The steward brought the men into Joseph’s house, gave them water to wash their feet, and provided fodder for their donkeys.

## Genesis 43:25
They prepared their gifts for Joseph’s arrival at noon, for they had heard they were to dine there.

## Genesis 43:26
When Joseph came home, they presented to him the gifts they had brought into the house, and they bowed down to the ground before him.

## Genesis 43:27
He asked them about their welfare, and said, “Is your elderly father, of whom you spoke, still alive?”

## Genesis 43:28
They replied, “Your servant our father is still alive and well.” And they bowed down in homage.

## Genesis 43:29
As he looked around and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son, he asked, “Is this your youngest brother, the one you told me about?” And he said, “May God be gracious to you, my son.”

## Genesis 43:30
Deeply moved at the sight of his brother, Joseph hurried out and sought a place to weep. He entered his private chamber and wept there.

## Genesis 43:31
After washing his face, he came out and, controlling himself, said, “Serve the meal.”

## Genesis 43:32
They served him by himself, the brothers by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because Egyptians could not eat with Hebrews, for that is detestable to them.

## Genesis 43:33
The men were seated before him in the order of their ages, from the firstborn to the youngest, and they looked at one another in astonishment.

## Genesis 43:34
When portions were served to them from Joseph’s table, Benjamin’s serving was five times larger than anyone else’s. So they feasted and drank freely with him.
