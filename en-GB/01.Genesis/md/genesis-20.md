# Genesis Chapter 20

## Genesis 20:1
Now Abraham travelled from there toward the region of the Negev and settled between Kadesh and Shur; he stayed for a time in Gerar.

## Genesis 20:2
And Abraham said of his wife Sarah, “She is my sister.” So Abimelech, the king of Gerar, sent for Sarah and took her.

## Genesis 20:3
But God came to Abimelech in a dream during the night and said to him, “Behold, you are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken; she is a married woman.”

## Genesis 20:4
Now Abimelech had not approached her, and he said, “Lord, will you destroy a nation, even if it is innocent?

## Genesis 20:5
Did he not himself say to me, ‘She is my sister’? And she herself said, ‘He is my brother.’ I have done this with a clear conscience and innocent hands.”

## Genesis 20:6
Then God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know that you did this with a clear conscience, and I have kept you from sinning against me. That is why I did not let you touch her.

## Genesis 20:7
Now return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not return her, be assured that you and all who belong to you will surely die.”

## Genesis 20:8
So Abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants, and told them all these things; and the men were greatly afraid.

## Genesis 20:9
Then Abimelech summoned Abraham and said to him, “What have you done to us? How have I wronged you that you have brought such a great sin upon me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that should not be done.”

## Genesis 20:10
And Abimelech asked Abraham, “What prompted you to do this?”

## Genesis 20:11
Abraham replied, “I thought, surely there is no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.

## Genesis 20:12
Besides, she truly is my sister, the daughter of my father but not of my mother; and she became my wife.

## Genesis 20:13
And when God caused me to wander from my father’s house, I said to her, ‘This is the kindness you can show to me: Everywhere we go, say of me, “He is my brother.”’”

## Genesis 20:14
Then Abimelech took sheep and cattle and male and female servants, and gave them to Abraham, and returned his wife Sarah to him.

## Genesis 20:15
And Abimelech said, “Behold, my land is before you; settle wherever you please.”

## Genesis 20:16
To Sarah he said, “I have given your brother a thousand shekels of silver. This is to cover any offence against you before all who are with you; you are completely vindicated.”

## Genesis 20:17
Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his female slaves so that they could bear children again,

## Genesis 20:18
for the Lord had closed all the wombs of the household of Abimelech because of Sarah, Abraham’s wife.
