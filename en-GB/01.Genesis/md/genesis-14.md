and the Horites in their hill country of Seir, as far as El Paran near the wilderness.

## Genesis 14:7
Then they turned back and came to En Mishpat (which is Kadesh), and conquered the whole territory of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites who dwelt in Hazezon Tamar.

against Kedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goiim, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar—four kings against five.

## Genesis 14:10
Now the Valley of Siddim was full of tar pits, and when the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some fell into them, while the rest fled to the hills.

The four kings seized all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their provisions, and then departed.

## Genesis 14:12
They also took Lot, Abram’s nephew, and his possessions, for he was residing in Sodom.

## Genesis 14:13
Then a survivor came and informed Abram the Hebrew. He was living by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and Aner, who were allies with Abram.

When Abram heard that his kinsman had been captured, he mustered the 318 trained men born in his household and pursued as far as Dan.

During the night, Abram divided his forces to attack them, and he defeated them, pursuing them as far as Hobah, north of Damascus.

After Abram returned from defeating Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him, the king of Sodom came out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh (which is the King’s Valley).

## Genesis 14:18
Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine; he was a priest of God Most High.

## Genesis 14:19
He blessed Abram, saying, “Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth.

## Genesis 14:20
And praised be God Most High, who has handed your enemies over to you.” Then Abram gave him a tenth of everything.

## Genesis 14:21
The king of Sodom said to Abram, “Return the people to me and keep the goods for yourself.”

## Genesis 14:22
But Abram said to the king of Sodom, “I have sworn an oath to the Lord, God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth,

## Genesis 14:23
that I will not take anything belonging to you, not even a thread or a sandal strap, so that you may never say, ‘I made Abram rich.’

## Genesis 14:24
I will accept nothing but what my men have eaten and the share that belongs to the men who went with me—Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre. Let them take their share.”
