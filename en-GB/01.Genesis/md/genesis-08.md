# Genesis Chapter 8

## Genesis 8:1

But God remembered Noah and all the animals and livestock that were with him in the ark, and He sent a wind across the earth, causing the waters to subside.

## Genesis 8:2

The fountains of the deep and the floodgates of the heavens were closed, and the rain from the sky was restrained.

## Genesis 8:3

The waters receded steadily from the earth, and by the end of one hundred and fifty days, the waters had decreased.

## Genesis 8:4

On the seventeenth day of the seventh month, the ark settled on the mountains of Ararat.

## Genesis 8:5

The waters continued to decrease until the tenth month, and on the first day of the tenth month, the tops of the mountains became visible.

## Genesis 8:6

After forty days, Noah opened the window of the ark he had constructed.

## Genesis 8:7

He sent out a raven, and it flew back and forth until the waters had dried up from the earth.

## Genesis 8:8

Then he sent out a dove to determine if the waters had receded from the surface of the ground.

## Genesis 8:9

But the dove found no place to rest its foot, so it returned to him in the ark, for the waters were still over the surface of the earth. He reached out his hand, took the dove, and brought it back into the ark.

## Genesis 8:10

He waited another seven days and sent the dove out from the ark once more.

## Genesis 8:11

The dove returned to him in the evening, and there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf. So Noah knew that the waters had receded from the earth.

## Genesis 8:12

He waited yet another seven days and sent the dove out again, but it did not return to him.

## Genesis 8:13

In the six hundred and first year, on the first day of the first month, the waters had dried up from the earth. Noah removed the covering of the ark and saw that the surface of the ground was dry.

## Genesis 8:14

By the twenty-seventh day of the second month, the earth was thoroughly dry.

## Genesis 8:15

Then God spoke to Noah, saying,

## Genesis 8:16

“Leave the ark, you and your wife, your sons, and your sons’ wives with you.

## Genesis 8:17

Bring out every living creature that is with you—the birds, the animals, and every creature that moves on the ground—so they may breed abundantly on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply.”

## Genesis 8:18

Thus, Noah departed with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives.

## Genesis 8:19

Every animal, every crawling creature, and every bird, everything that moves on the earth, went out of the ark, one kind after another.

## Genesis 8:20

Then Noah built an altar to the Lord and took some of every clean animal and bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.

## Genesis 8:21

The Lord smelled the pleasing aroma and said to Himself, “Never again will I curse the ground because of humans, even though every inclination of the human heart is evil from youth. Nor will I ever again destroy every living creature as I have done.

## Genesis 8:22

For while the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night will not cease.”
