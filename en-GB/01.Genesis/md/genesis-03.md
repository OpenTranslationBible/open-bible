# Genesis Chapter 3

## Genesis 3:1
Now the serpent was more cunning than any of the wild animals that the Lord God had made. He said to the woman, “Did God indeed say, ‘You shall not eat from any tree in the garden’?”

## Genesis 3:2
The woman replied to the serpent, “We may eat the fruit from the trees in the garden,

## Genesis 3:3
but God did say, ‘You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the centre of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.’”

## Genesis 3:4
The serpent said to the woman, “You will certainly not die!

## Genesis 3:5
For God knows that when you eat from it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”

## Genesis 3:6
When the woman saw that the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some of its fruit and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it.

## Genesis 3:7
Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realised they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves coverings.

## Genesis 3:8
Then they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden.

## Genesis 3:9
But the Lord God called to the man, and said to him, “Where are you?”

## Genesis 3:10
He replied, “I heard you in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid myself.”

## Genesis 3:11
And He said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree from which I commanded you not to eat?”

## Genesis 3:12
The man said, “The woman you put here with me—she gave me some fruit from the tree, and I ate it.”

## Genesis 3:13
Then the Lord God said to the woman, “What is this you have done?” The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”

## Genesis 3:14
So the Lord God said to the serpent, “Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and all wild animals! You will crawl on your belly and eat dust all the days of your life.

## Genesis 3:15
And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.”

## Genesis 3:16
To the woman He said, “I will greatly increase your pain in childbirth; with painful labour you will give birth to children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you.”

## Genesis 3:17
To Adam He said, “Because you listened to your wife and ate fruit from the tree about which I commanded you, ‘You shall not eat from it,’ cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat food from it all the days of your life.

## Genesis 3:18
It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you shall eat the plants of the field.

## Genesis 3:19
By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground, since from it you were taken; for you are dust, and to dust you shall return.”

## Genesis 3:20
The man named his wife Eve, because she was the mother of all the living.

## Genesis 3:21
The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them.

## Genesis 3:22
And the Lord God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of Us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever.”

## Genesis 3:23
Therefore the Lord God sent him out of the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he was taken.

## Genesis 3:24
So He drove the man out; and at the east of the Garden of Eden He placed cherubim and a flaming sword that turned every direction to guard the way to the tree of life.
