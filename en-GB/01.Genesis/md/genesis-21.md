# Genesis Chapter 21

## Genesis 21:1

The Lord was attentive to Sarah as He had spoken, and the Lord fulfilled for Sarah what He had promised.

## Genesis 21:2

Sarah conceived and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the time God had specified to him.

## Genesis 21:3

Abraham named his son Isaac, the son whom Sarah had borne to him.

## Genesis 21:4

Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, following God's command.

## Genesis 21:5

Abraham was a century old when his son Isaac came into the world.

## Genesis 21:6

Sarah declared, “God has brought me laughter, and everyone who hears will share in my joy.”

## Genesis 21:7

She also said, “Who would have told Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have given him a son in his old age.”

## Genesis 21:8

The child grew and was weaned, and Abraham celebrated with a great feast on the day Isaac was weaned.

## Genesis 21:9

Sarah observed the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking.

## Genesis 21:10

She said to Abraham, “Expel this slave woman and her son, for the son of this slave shall not share the inheritance with my son Isaac.”

## Genesis 21:11

This matter troubled Abraham greatly because of his son.

## Genesis 21:12

But God said to Abraham, “Do not be distressed about the boy and your slave woman. Listen to Sarah, for through Isaac your descendants will be named.

## Genesis 21:13

I will also make the son of the slave woman into a nation, because he is your descendant.”

## Genesis 21:14

Early the next morning, Abraham took bread and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar, placing them on her shoulder, and sent her away with the boy. She departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.

## Genesis 21:15

When the water in the skin was exhausted, she placed the boy under one of the bushes.

## Genesis 21:16

She went and sat down opposite him, about a bowshot away, saying, “I cannot watch the boy die.” And she sat there, raising her voice and weeping.

## Genesis 21:17

God heard the boy's cries, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven, “What troubles you, Hagar? Do not fear, for God has heard the boy's voice where he is.

## Genesis 21:18

Arise, lift up the boy, and hold him by the hand, for I will make him into a great nation.”

## Genesis 21:19

God enabled her to see a well of water. She went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.

## Genesis 21:20

God was with the boy as he grew up. He lived in the wilderness and became an archer.

## Genesis 21:21

He lived in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother found him a wife from Egypt.

## Genesis 21:22

During that period, Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, said to Abraham, “God is with you in all your endeavours.

## Genesis 21:23

Now swear to me here before God that you will not deceive me or my descendants. Show the same kindness to me and the land where you reside as I have shown to you.”

## Genesis 21:24

Abraham said, “I do so swear it.”

## Genesis 21:25

Then Abraham complained to Abimelech about a well of water that Abimelech’s servants had seized.

## Genesis 21:26

Abimelech replied, “I do not know who has done this. You did not inform me, and I only heard about it today.”

## Genesis 21:27

So Abraham took sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelech, and the two men made a covenant.

## Genesis 21:28

Abraham selected seven ewe lambs from the flock.

## Genesis 21:29

Abimelech asked Abraham, “What is the significance of these seven ewe lambs you have set apart?”

## Genesis 21:30

He replied, “Accept these seven lambs from my hand as a testimony that I dug this well.”

## Genesis 21:31

Therefore, that place was called Beersheba, because there the two of them swore an oath.

## Genesis 21:32

After making a covenant at Beersheba, Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, returned to the land of the Philistines.

## Genesis 21:33

Abraham established a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he invoked the name of the Lord, the Everlasting God.

## Genesis 21:34

And Abraham resided in the land of the Philistines for a long period.
