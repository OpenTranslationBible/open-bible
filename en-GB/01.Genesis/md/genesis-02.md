# Genesis Chapter 2

## Genesis 2:1
Thus the heavens and the earth were completed, along with all their array of lights.

## Genesis 2:2
By the seventh day, God had completed His work which He had been doing; so He rested on the seventh day from all His work.

## Genesis 2:3
Then God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it He rested from all the work of creation He had accomplished.

## Genesis 2:4
This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens.

## Genesis 2:5
Now no shrub of the field had yet appeared on the earth, and no plant of the field had yet sprouted, for the Lord God had not sent rain upon the earth, and there was no one to work the ground.

## Genesis 2:6
But a mist used to rise from the earth and water the whole surface of the ground.

## Genesis 2:7
Then the Lord God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.

## Genesis 2:8
The Lord God planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there He placed the man He had formed.

## Genesis 2:9
Out of the ground, the Lord God caused every tree to grow that is pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

## Genesis 2:10
A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it divided and became four headwaters.

## Genesis 2:11
The name of the first is Pishon; it winds through the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.

## Genesis 2:12
The gold of that land is good; aromatic resin and onyx are also found there.

## Genesis 2:13
The name of the second river is Gihon; it flows through the whole land of Cush.

## Genesis 2:14
The name of the third river is Tigris; it flows east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.

## Genesis 2:15
The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to cultivate it and keep it.

## Genesis 2:16
And the Lord God commanded the man, “You may freely eat from any tree in the garden;

## Genesis 2:17
but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will surely die.”

## Genesis 2:18
The Lord God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.”

## Genesis 2:19
Now the Lord God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.

## Genesis 2:20
So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky, and all the wild animals. But for Adam, no suitable helper was found.

## Genesis 2:21
So the Lord God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, He took one of the man’s ribs and closed up the place with flesh.

## Genesis 2:22
Then the Lord God fashioned a woman from the rib He had taken out of the man, and brought her to the man.

## Genesis 2:23
The man said, “This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called ‘woman,’ for she was taken out of man.”

## Genesis 2:24
For this reason, a man shall leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.

## Genesis 2:25
The man and his wife were both naked, yet they felt no shame.
