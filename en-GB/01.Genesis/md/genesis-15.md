# Genesis Chapter 15

## Genesis 15:1
After these events, the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision, saying, “Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield; your reward will be exceedingly great.”

## Genesis 15:2
But Abram said, “Lord God, what can you give me, since I remain childless, and the heir of my household is Eliezer of Damascus?”

## Genesis 15:3
And Abram said, “You have given me no offspring; so a servant born in my house will be my heir.”

## Genesis 15:4
Then the word of the Lord came to him, saying, “This man shall not be your heir, but a son who is your own flesh and blood shall be your heir.”

## Genesis 15:5
He took him outside and said, “Look up at the heavens and count the stars, if you are able to count them.” Then he said to him, “So shall your descendants be.”

## Genesis 15:6
Abram believed the Lord, and it was credited to him as righteousness.

## Genesis 15:7
And He said to him, “I am the Lord, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to possess.”

## Genesis 15:8
But Abram said, “Lord God, how can I know that I will possess it?”

## Genesis 15:9
So the Lord said to him, “Bring me a three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old goat, a three-year-old ram, a dove, and a young pigeon.”

## Genesis 15:10
Abram brought all these to Him, cut them in two, and arranged the halves opposite each other; but he did not cut the birds.

## Genesis 15:11
Then birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, but Abram drove them away.

## Genesis 15:12
As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and a dreadful and great darkness came over him.

## Genesis 15:13
Then the Lord said to Abram, “Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a land not their own, where they will be enslaved and oppressed for four hundred years.

## Genesis 15:14
But I will judge the nation they serve, and afterward they will come out with great possessions.

## Genesis 15:15
As for you, you will go to your ancestors in peace and be buried at a good old age.

## Genesis 15:16
In the fourth generation, your descendants will return here, for the sin of the Amorites has not yet reached its full measure.”

## Genesis 15:17
When the sun had set and it was dark, a smoking firepot with a blazing torch appeared and passed between the pieces.

## Genesis 15:18
On that day, the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, “To your descendants I have given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates—

## Genesis 15:19
the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites,

## Genesis 15:20
Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites,

## Genesis 15:21
Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites, and Jebusites.”
