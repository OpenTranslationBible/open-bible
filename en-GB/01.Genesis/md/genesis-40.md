# Genesis Chapter 40

## Genesis 40:1
Some time later, the cupbearer and the baker for the king of Egypt offended their lord, the king of Egypt.

## Genesis 40:2
Pharaoh became very angry with his two officials, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker.

## Genesis 40:3
He put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the same prison where Joseph was confined.

## Genesis 40:4
The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he attended to them; they were in custody for some time.

## Genesis 40:5
The cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison, each had a dream the same night, and each dream had its own meaning.

## Genesis 40:6
When Joseph came to them in the morning, he noticed that they were dejected.

## Genesis 40:7
So he asked the officials of Pharaoh who were in custody with him in his master’s house, “Why do you appear downcast today?”

## Genesis 40:8
They replied, “We have had dreams, and there is no one to interpret them.” Joseph said to them, “Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell me your dreams, please.”

## Genesis 40:9
So the chief cupbearer recounted his dream to Joseph, saying, “In my dream, there was a vine in front of me,

## Genesis 40:10
and on the vine were three branches. As it budded, its blossoms opened, and its clusters ripened into grapes.

## Genesis 40:11
Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, squeezed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and placed the cup in his hand.”

## Genesis 40:12
Joseph said to him, “This is the interpretation: the three branches are three days.

## Genesis 40:13
Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your position, and you will put Pharaoh’s cup in his hand, just as you did when you were his cupbearer.

## Genesis 40:14
But when it goes well with you, remember me and show me kindness; mention me to Pharaoh and get me out of this prison.

## Genesis 40:15
I was forcibly taken from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing to deserve being put in a dungeon.”

## Genesis 40:16
When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable, he said to Joseph, “I also had a dream: on my head were three baskets of bread.

## Genesis 40:17
In the top basket were all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating them from the basket on my head.”

## Genesis 40:18
Joseph answered, “This is the interpretation: the three baskets are three days.

## Genesis 40:19
Within three days Pharaoh will lift off your head and hang you on a pole, and the birds will eat your flesh.”

## Genesis 40:20
On the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, he held a feast for all his officials. He lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker in the presence of his officials:

## Genesis 40:21
He restored the chief cupbearer to his position, so that he once again placed the cup into Pharaoh’s hand;

## Genesis 40:22
but he executed the chief baker, just as Joseph had interpreted to them.

## Genesis 40:23
Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph; he forgot about him.
