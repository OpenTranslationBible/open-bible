# Genesis Chapter 33

## Genesis 33:1
Jacob lifted his eyes and saw Esau approaching with four hundred men. He divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two maidservants.

## Genesis 33:2
He placed the maidservants and their children in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph at the back.

## Genesis 33:3
Jacob himself went ahead and bowed to the ground seven times as he drew near to his brother.

## Genesis 33:4
Esau ran to meet Jacob, embraced him, fell on his neck, and kissed him, and they both wept.

## Genesis 33:5
Esau looked up and noticed the women and children, asking, “Who are these with you?” Jacob replied, “These are the children God has graciously given to your servant.”

## Genesis 33:6
Then the maidservants and their children came forward and bowed down.

## Genesis 33:7
Leah and her children also came forward and bowed down. Finally, Joseph and Rachel approached and bowed down.

## Genesis 33:8
Esau inquired, “What do you mean by all these droves I met?” Jacob answered, “To find favour in your sight, my lord.”

## Genesis 33:9
Esau said, “I have plenty, my brother. Let what you have remain yours.”

## Genesis 33:10
Jacob insisted, “No, please, if I have found favour in your sight, accept this gift from me, for seeing your face is like seeing the face of God, now that you have received me favourably.”

## Genesis 33:11
“Please accept the present brought to you, for God has been gracious to me and I have all I need.” Because Jacob urged him, Esau accepted.

## Genesis 33:12
Esau suggested, “Let us set out and go, and I will accompany you.”

## Genesis 33:13
Jacob said, “My lord knows the children are frail, and I must care for the nursing flocks and herds. If driven hard for a day, the animals will perish.”

## Genesis 33:14
“Please let my lord go ahead of his servant. I will move at a gentle pace, according to the livestock and children, until I come to my lord in Seir.”

## Genesis 33:15
Esau offered, “Let me leave some of my men with you.” But Jacob said, “Why do that? Let me find favour in the sight of my lord.”

## Genesis 33:16
So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.

## Genesis 33:17
Jacob, however, travelled to Succoth, where he built a house and shelters for his livestock. Hence, the place is called Succoth.

## Genesis 33:18
Jacob arrived safely at the city of Shechem in Canaan, coming from Paddan-aram, and camped before the city.

## Genesis 33:19
He purchased the plot of land where he had pitched his tent from the sons of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for a hundred pieces of silver.

## Genesis 33:20
There he set up an altar and named it El-Elohe-Israel.
