# Genesis Chapter 41

## Genesis 41:1

After two complete years, Pharaoh dreamed that he was standing by the River Nile.

## Genesis 41:2

And from the river, seven cows came up, well-fed and sleek, and they grazed in the marsh grass.

## Genesis 41:3

Then seven other cows emerged after them from the Nile, ugly and thin, and they stood by the other cows on the riverbank.

## Genesis 41:4

The thin, ugly cows consumed the seven well-fed, sleek cows. Then Pharaoh awoke.

## Genesis 41:5

He fell asleep again and had a second dream: seven ears of grain, full and good, were growing on a single stalk.

## Genesis 41:6

Then seven other ears, thin and scorched by the east wind, sprouted after them.

## Genesis 41:7

The thin ears swallowed up the seven full ears. Then Pharaoh awoke, and it was a dream.

## Genesis 41:8

In the morning, his spirit was troubled, so he summoned all the magicians and wise men of Egypt. Pharaoh recounted his dreams to them, but none could interpret them for him.

## Genesis 41:9

Then the chief cupbearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying, “Today I remember my faults.

## Genesis 41:10

Pharaoh was angry with his servants and put me in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, both me and the chief baker.

## Genesis 41:11

We each had a dream the same night, and each dream had its own interpretation.

## Genesis 41:12

A young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. We told him our dreams, and he interpreted them for us, giving each man the interpretation of his dream.

## Genesis 41:13

And things turned out just as he interpreted: I was restored to my position, and the other man was hanged.”

## Genesis 41:14

So Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and they brought him quickly out of the dungeon. After he had shaved and changed his clothes, he came before Pharaoh.

## Genesis 41:15

Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I have had a dream, and no one can interpret it. But I have heard it said of you that you can understand a dream to interpret it.”

## Genesis 41:16

Joseph replied to Pharaoh, “It is not in me; God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.”

## Genesis 41:17

Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “In my dream, I was standing on the bank of the Nile,

## Genesis 41:18

when seven cows, fat and sleek, came up out of the river and grazed in the marsh grass.

## Genesis 41:19

Then seven other cows came up after them, poor, very ugly and thin, such as I had never seen in all the land of Egypt.

## Genesis 41:20

The thin, ugly cows consumed the seven fat cows that came up first.

## Genesis 41:21

But when they had eaten them, no one could tell that they had done so; they looked just as ugly as before. Then I awoke.

## Genesis 41:22

In my dream, I also saw seven ears of grain, full and good, growing on a single stalk.

## Genesis 41:23

Then seven ears, withered, thin, and scorched by the east wind, sprouted after them.

## Genesis 41:24

The thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears. I told this to the magicians, but none could explain it to me.”

## Genesis 41:25

Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, “Pharaoh's dreams are one and the same. God has revealed to Pharaoh what He intends to do.

## Genesis 41:26

The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; it is one and the same dream.

## Genesis 41:27

The seven thin and ugly cows that came up after them are seven years, and so are the seven worthless ears scorched by the east wind: they are seven years of famine.

## Genesis 41:28

It is just as I said to Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what He intends to do.

## Genesis 41:29

Seven years of great abundance are to come, through all the land of Egypt,

## Genesis 41:30

but seven years of famine will follow them. Then all the abundance in Egypt will be forgotten, and the famine will devastate the land.

## Genesis 41:31

The prosperity in the land will fade from memory because the famine that follows it will be extremely severe.

## Genesis 41:32

The reason the dream was given to Pharaoh in two forms is that the matter has been firmly decided by God, and He will carry it out soon.

## Genesis 41:33

Now let Pharaoh look for a discerning and wise man and put him in charge of the land of Egypt.

## Genesis 41:34

Let Pharaoh appoint overseers over the land and take a fifth of the harvest of Egypt during the seven years of abundance.

## Genesis 41:35

They should collect all the food of these good years that are coming and store up the grain under Pharaoh’s authority, to be kept in the cities for food.

## Genesis 41:36

This food should be held in reserve for the country, to be used during the seven years of famine that will come upon Egypt, so that the country may not be devastated by the famine.”

## Genesis 41:37

The plan seemed favourable to Pharaoh and to all his officials.

## Genesis 41:38

So Pharaoh asked them, “Can we find anyone like this man, one who possesses the spirit of God?”

## Genesis 41:39

Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since God has made all this known to you, there is no one as insightful and wise as you.

## Genesis 41:40

You shall oversee my palace, and all my people will follow your commands. Only in regard to the throne will I be greater than you.”

## Genesis 41:41

So Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I hereby appoint you over the whole land of Egypt.”

## Genesis 41:42

Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his finger and placed it on Joseph’s finger. He dressed him in robes of fine linen and adorned him with a gold chain around his neck.

## Genesis 41:43

He had him ride in his second chariot, and people shouted before him, “Bow the knee!” Thus he put him in charge of the whole land of Egypt.

## Genesis 41:44

Then Pharaoh declared to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh, yet without your consent, no one shall do anything in all Egypt.”

## Genesis 41:45

Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-Paneah and gave him Asenath, daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, to be his wife. And Joseph journeyed throughout the land of Egypt.

## Genesis 41:46

Joseph was thirty years old when he began serving Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from Pharaoh’s presence and travelled throughout Egypt.

## Genesis 41:47

Throughout the seven years of abundance, the land yielded generously.

## Genesis 41:48

Joseph gathered all the food produced in those seven years of abundance in Egypt and stored it in the cities. In each city, he placed the food grown in the fields surrounding it.

## Genesis 41:49

Joseph stored up huge quantities of grain, like the sand of the sea; it was so much that he stopped measuring it because it was beyond measure.

## Genesis 41:50

Before the years of famine arrived, Joseph had two sons with Asenath, daughter of Potiphera, priest of On.

## Genesis 41:51

Joseph named his firstborn Manasseh and said, “It is because God has made me forget all my hardship and all my father’s household.”

## Genesis 41:52

The second son he named Ephraim and said, “It is because God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.”

## Genesis 41:53

The seven years of abundance in Egypt concluded,

## Genesis 41:54

and the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had foretold. There was famine in all the other lands, but in the entire land of Egypt, there was food.

## Genesis 41:55

When all Egypt began to feel the famine, the people cried to Pharaoh for food. Then Pharaoh instructed all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph and do what he tells you.”

## Genesis 41:56

As the famine spread across the entire country, Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe throughout Egypt.

## Genesis 41:57

And people from all over the world came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph, because the famine was severe everywhere.
