# Genesis Chapter 16

## Genesis 16:1
Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, had borne him no children. But she had an Egyptian maidservant named Hagar.

## Genesis 16:2
So she said to Abram, “The Lord has kept me from having children. Go, sleep with my servant; perhaps I can build a family through her.” And Abram agreed to what Sarai said.

## Genesis 16:3
So after Abram had been living in Canaan for ten years, Sarai took her Egyptian servant Hagar and gave her to her husband to be his wife.

## Genesis 16:4
He slept with Hagar, and she conceived. When she realised she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress.

## Genesis 16:5
Then Sarai said to Abram, “You are responsible for the wrong I am suffering. I gave my servant into your arms, and now that she knows she is pregnant, she despises me. May the Lord judge between you and me.”

## Genesis 16:6
Abram replied, “Your servant is in your hands. Do with her whatever you think best.” Then Sarai mistreated Hagar; so she fled from her.

## Genesis 16:7
The angel of the Lord found Hagar near a spring in the desert; it was the spring beside the road to Shur.

## Genesis 16:8
And he said, “Hagar, servant of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?” “I’m running away from my mistress Sarai,” she answered.

## Genesis 16:9
Then the angel of the Lord told her, “Go back to your mistress and submit to her.”

## Genesis 16:10
The angel added, “I will increase your descendants so much that they will be too numerous to count.”

## Genesis 16:11
The angel of the Lord also said to her: “You are now pregnant and will give birth to a son. You shall name him Ishmael, for the Lord has heard of your misery.

## Genesis 16:12
He will be a wild donkey of a man; his hand will be against everyone and everyone’s hand against him, and he will live in hostility toward all his brothers.”

## Genesis 16:13
She gave this name to the Lord who spoke to her: “You are the God who sees me,” for she said, “I have now seen the One who sees me.”

## Genesis 16:14
That is why the well was called Beer Lahai Roi; it is still there, between Kadesh and Bered.

## Genesis 16:15
So Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son she had borne.

## Genesis 16:16
Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore him Ishmael.
