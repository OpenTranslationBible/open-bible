# Genesis Chapter 16

## Genesis 16:1
Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, had not borne him any children, but she had an Egyptian slave named Hagar.

## Genesis 16:2
Sarai said to Abram, “The Lord has prevented me from having children. Please have relations with my slave; perhaps I can build a family through her.” Abram listened to Sarai.

## Genesis 16:3
After Abram had lived ten years in Canaan, Sarai, Abram’s wife, took her Egyptian slave Hagar and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.

## Genesis 16:4
He had relations with Hagar, and she conceived. When she realised she was pregnant, she began to look down on her mistress.

## Genesis 16:5
Sarai said to Abram, “You are responsible for the wrong I am suffering. I put my slave into your arms, and now that she knows she is pregnant, she despises me. May the Lord judge between you and me.”

## Genesis 16:6
Abram replied to Sarai, “Your slave is in your hands; do with her whatever you think best.” Then Sarai treated Hagar harshly, and she fled from her.

## Genesis 16:7
The angel of the Lord found Hagar by a spring in the wilderness; it was the spring on the way to Shur.

## Genesis 16:8
He said, “Hagar, slave of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?” She replied, “I am fleeing from my mistress Sarai.”

## Genesis 16:9
The angel of the Lord said to her, “Return to your mistress and submit to her authority.”

## Genesis 16:10
The angel added, “I will greatly increase your descendants so that they will be too numerous to count.”

## Genesis 16:11
The angel of the Lord said further to her, “You are pregnant and will give birth to a son. You shall name him Ishmael, for the Lord has heard of your misery.

## Genesis 16:12
He will be a wild donkey of a man; his hand will be against everyone, and everyone’s hand against him, and he will live in hostility towards all his brothers.”

## Genesis 16:13
She called the name of the Lord who spoke to her, “You are the God who sees me,” for she said, “I have now seen the One who sees me.”

## Genesis 16:14
That is why the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; it is still there, between Kadesh and Bered.

## Genesis 16:15
Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram named the son she bore Ishmael.

## Genesis 16:16
Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to him.
