# Genesis Chapter 47

## Genesis 47:1
Joseph went to Pharaoh and said, “My father and brothers, along with their flocks, herds, and all they possess, have come from Canaan and are now in Goshen.”

## Genesis 47:2
He selected five of his brothers to present before Pharaoh.

## Genesis 47:3
Pharaoh inquired of them, “What is your occupation?” They answered, “Your servants are shepherds, as were our ancestors.”

## Genesis 47:4
They continued, “We have come to reside here temporarily, for the famine in Canaan is severe and there is no pasture for our flocks. Please allow your servants to dwell in Goshen.”

## Genesis 47:5
Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, “Your father and brothers have come to you.

## Genesis 47:6
The land of Egypt is at your disposal; settle your family in the best part of the land. Let them reside in Goshen. If any among them are capable, put them in charge of my livestock.”

## Genesis 47:7
Joseph then brought his father Jacob to Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.

## Genesis 47:8
Pharaoh asked Jacob, “How many years have you lived?”

## Genesis 47:9
Jacob responded, “The years of my sojourning are 130. My years have been few and difficult, not reaching the lifespan of my ancestors during their sojourning.”

## Genesis 47:10
Jacob blessed Pharaoh again and departed from his presence.

## Genesis 47:11
Joseph settled his father and brothers in Egypt, granting them property in the best part of the land, the region of Rameses, as Pharaoh commanded.

## Genesis 47:12
Joseph also provided food for his father, brothers, and all his father’s household, according to the number of their dependents.

## Genesis 47:13
There was no food in the entire region due to the severity of the famine; Egypt and Canaan languished because of it.

## Genesis 47:14
Joseph gathered all the money found in Egypt and Canaan in exchange for grain, and he brought it to Pharaoh’s house.

## Genesis 47:15
When all the money in Egypt and Canaan was exhausted, the Egyptians approached Joseph, saying, “Give us food. Why should we perish before you? Our money is spent.”

## Genesis 47:16
Joseph replied, “Bring your livestock, and I will provide food in exchange for them, since your money is gone.”

## Genesis 47:17
They brought their livestock to Joseph, and he supplied them with food in exchange for their horses, sheep, goats, cattle, and donkeys. He sustained them through that year with food for their livestock.

## Genesis 47:18
When that year concluded, they returned the following year and said, “We cannot hide from our lord that our money is gone and our livestock belongs to you. There is nothing left for our lord but our bodies and our land.

## Genesis 47:19
Why should we perish before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land in exchange for food, and we will become Pharaoh’s servants. Provide us with seed so we may live and not die, and so the land does not become desolate.”

## Genesis 47:20
Joseph acquired all the land in Egypt for Pharaoh. Every Egyptian sold his field because the famine was severe, and the land became Pharaoh’s.

## Genesis 47:21
Joseph relocated the people to the cities from one end of Egypt to the other.

## Genesis 47:22
However, he did not purchase the land of the priests, as they received a regular allotment from Pharaoh and lived off it, so they did not sell their land.

## Genesis 47:23
Joseph told the people, “Today I have bought you and your land for Pharaoh. Here is seed for you to sow the land.

## Genesis 47:24
At harvest, you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and the remaining four-fifths will be yours for seed for the fields and for food for yourselves, your households, and your children.”

## Genesis 47:25
They said, “You have saved our lives! May we find favour in the eyes of our lord; we will be Pharaoh’s servants.”

## Genesis 47:26
Joseph established a law concerning the land of Egypt, still in force today, that a fifth of the produce belongs to Pharaoh. Only the land of the priests did not become Pharaoh’s.

## Genesis 47:27
The Israelites settled in Egypt, in the region of Goshen. They acquired property and were fruitful, multiplying greatly.

## Genesis 47:28
Jacob lived in Egypt for seventeen years, and his lifespan was 147 years.

## Genesis 47:29
When the time approached for Israel to die, he summoned his son Joseph and said, “If I have found favour in your sight, place your hand under my thigh and promise to show me kindness and faithfulness. Do not bury me in Egypt,

## Genesis 47:30
but when I rest with my fathers, carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burial place.” Joseph said, “I will do as you say.”

## Genesis 47:31
“Swear to me,” Jacob insisted. So Joseph swore to him, and Israel worshipped as he leaned on the top of his staff.
