# Zechariah Chapter 11

## Zechariah 11:1

> Open your doors, Lebanon,  
> So that fire may consume your cedars.

## Zechariah 11:2

> Wail, juniper, because the cedar has fallen,  
> For the glorious trees have been destroyed;  
> Wail, oaks of Bashan,  
> For the impenetrable forest has come down.

## Zechariah 11:3

> There is a sound of the shepherds’ wail,  
> For their glory is destroyed;  
> There is a sound of the roaring of young lions,  
> For the pride of the Jordan is ruined.

## Zechariah 11:4

This is what the Lord my God says:  
“Pasture the flock doomed to slaughter.

## Zechariah 11:5

Those who buy them slaughter them and go unpunished,  
And each of those who sell them says, ‘Blessed be the Lord, for I have become rich!’  
And their own shepherds do not spare them.

## Zechariah 11:6

For I will no longer spare the inhabitants of the land,” declares the Lord.  
“But behold, I am going to turn the people over,  
Each one into the hand of his neighbour and into the hand of his king;  
And they will crush the land,  
And I will not rescue them from their hand.”

## Zechariah 11:7

So I pastured the flock doomed to slaughter, thereby the afflicted of the flock. And I took for myself two staffs: the one I called Favour, and the other I called Union. So I pastured the flock.

## Zechariah 11:8

Then I eliminated the three shepherds in one month, for my soul was impatient with them, and their souls also were tired of me.

## Zechariah 11:9

Then I said,  
“I will not pasture you.  
What is to die, let it die,  
And what is to perish, let it perish;  
And let those who are left eat one another’s flesh.”

## Zechariah 11:10

And I took my staff Favour and cut it in pieces, to break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples.

## Zechariah 11:11

So it was broken on that day, and so the afflicted of the flock who were watching me realised that it was the word of the Lord.

## Zechariah 11:12

And I said to them,  
“If it is good in your sight, give me my wages; but if not, never mind!”  
So they weighed out thirty shekels of silver as my wages.

## Zechariah 11:13

Then the Lord said to me,  
“Throw it to the potter, that valuable price at which I was valued by them.”  
So I took the thirty shekels of silver and threw them to the potter in the house of the Lord.

## Zechariah 11:14

Then I cut in pieces my second staff Union, to break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.

## Zechariah 11:15

And the Lord said to me,  
“Take again for yourself the equipment of a foolish shepherd.

## Zechariah 11:16

For behold, I am going to raise up a shepherd in the land who will not care for the perishing,  
Seek the scattered, heal the broken, or sustain the one standing,  
But will devour the flesh of the fat sheep and tear off their hoofs.

## Zechariah 11:17

> Woe to the worthless shepherd  
> Who abandons the flock!  
> A sword will be on his arm  
> And on his right eye!  
> His arm will be totally withered,  
> And his right eye will be blind.”
