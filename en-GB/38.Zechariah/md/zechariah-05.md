# Zechariah Chapter 5

## Zechariah 5:1
I lifted my eyes once more and saw, and behold, there was a flying scroll.

## Zechariah 5:2
And he said to me, “What do you see?” I replied, “I see a flying scroll; its length is twenty cubits and its width ten cubits.”

## Zechariah 5:3
Then he said to me, “This is the curse that is going out over the entire land; for everyone who steals will be removed according to the writing on one side, and everyone who swears falsely will be removed according to the writing on the other side.

## Zechariah 5:4
‘I will send it forth,’ declares the Lord of Hosts, ‘and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of the one who swears falsely by my name. It will remain in that house and destroy it with its timber and stones.’”

## Zechariah 5:5
Then the angel who was speaking with me came forward and said, “Lift your eyes now and see what this is that is going forth.”

## Zechariah 5:6
And I asked, “What is it?” He replied, “This is the basket going forth.” And he added, “This is their iniquity throughout the land.”

## Zechariah 5:7
And behold, a lead cover was lifted up, and there was a woman sitting inside the basket.

## Zechariah 5:8
He said, “This is Wickedness,” and he pushed her back into the basket and cast the lead weight over its opening.

## Zechariah 5:9
Then I looked up and saw two women coming out with the wind in their wings; they had wings like those of a stork, and they lifted the basket between the earth and the heavens.

## Zechariah 5:10
I asked the angel who was speaking with me, “Where are they taking the basket?”

## Zechariah 5:11
He replied, “To build a house for it in the land of Shinar; and when it is ready, it will be set there on its own base.”
