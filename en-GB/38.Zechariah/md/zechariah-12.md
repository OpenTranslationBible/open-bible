# Zechariah Chapter 12

## Zechariah 12:1
A declaration: The word of the Lord concerning Israel. The Lord, who stretches out the heavens, who lays the foundation of the earth, and who forms the spirit of a person within him, proclaims:

## Zechariah 12:2
“Behold, I am going to make Jerusalem a cup that causes all the surrounding peoples to stagger. Judah will also be besieged alongside Jerusalem.

## Zechariah 12:3
On that day, when all the nations of the earth are gathered against her, I will make Jerusalem an immovable stone for all the peoples. All who attempt to lift it will severely injure themselves.

## Zechariah 12:4
On that day,” declares the Lord, “I will strike every horse with panic and its rider with madness. I will keep a watchful eye over the house of Judah, while I blind every horse of the nations.

## Zechariah 12:5
Then the clans of Judah will say in their hearts, ‘The inhabitants of Jerusalem are strong through the Lord Almighty, their God.’

## Zechariah 12:6
“On that day I will make the clans of Judah like a firepot among wood, like a flaming torch among sheaves. They will consume all the surrounding peoples on the right and on the left, while the inhabitants of Jerusalem remain in their place in Jerusalem.

## Zechariah 12:7
The Lord will save the dwellings of Judah first, so that the glory of the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will not surpass that of Judah.

## Zechariah 12:8
On that day the Lord will protect the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the feeblest among them will be like David, and the house of David will be like God, like the angel of the Lord before them.

## Zechariah 12:9
On that day I will set out to destroy all the nations that rise against Jerusalem.

## Zechariah 12:10
“And I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit of grace and supplication. They will look upon me whom they have pierced, and they will mourn for him as one mourns for an only child, and grieve bitterly for him as one grieves for a firstborn.

## Zechariah 12:11
On that day the mourning in Jerusalem will be as great as the mourning of Hadad Rimmon in the plain of Megiddo.

## Zechariah 12:12
The land will mourn, every family by itself, with their wives by themselves: the family of the house of David by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself and their wives by themselves;

## Zechariah 12:13
the family of the house of Levi by itself and their wives by themselves; the family of Shimei by itself and their wives by themselves;

## Zechariah 12:14
and all the remaining families, every family by itself, and their wives by themselves.
