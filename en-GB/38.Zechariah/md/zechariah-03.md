# Zechariah Chapter 3

## Zechariah 3:1
Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord, with Satan standing at his right side to accuse him.

## Zechariah 3:2
The Lord said to Satan, “The Lord rebuke you, Satan! The Lord, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked from the fire?”

## Zechariah 3:3
Now Joshua was dressed in filthy garments as he stood before the angel.

## Zechariah 3:4
The angel said to those who were standing before him, “Remove his filthy garments.” Then he said to Joshua, “See, I have taken away your iniquity, and I will clothe you with rich robes.”

## Zechariah 3:5
Then I said, “Place a clean turban on his head.” So they placed a clean turban on his head and clothed him, while the angel of the Lord stood by.

## Zechariah 3:6
The angel of the Lord gave this charge to Joshua:

## Zechariah 3:7
“This is what the Lord of hosts says: ‘If you will walk in my ways and keep my charge, then you will govern my house and have charge of my courts, and I will give you access among these who stand here.

## Zechariah 3:8
“‘Listen, High Priest Joshua, you and your companions seated before you, who are men symbolic of things to come: I am going to bring my servant, the Branch.

## Zechariah 3:9
See, the stone I have set before Joshua! On that one stone are seven eyes, and I will engrave an inscription on it,’ says the Lord of hosts, ‘and I will remove the iniquity of this land in a single day.

## Zechariah 3:10
“‘In that day,’ declares the Lord of hosts, ‘each of you will invite your neighbour to sit under his vine and fig tree.’”
