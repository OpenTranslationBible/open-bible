# Zechariah Chapter 6

## Zechariah 6:1

Now I raised my eyes again and looked, and behold, four chariots were coming out from between the two mountains; and the mountains were bronze mountains.

## Zechariah 6:2

With the first chariot were red horses, with the second chariot black horses,

## Zechariah 6:3

With the third chariot white horses, and with the fourth chariot strong spotted horses.

## Zechariah 6:4

So I responded and said to the angel who was speaking with me,  
“What are these, my lord?”

## Zechariah 6:5

The angel replied to me,  
“These are the four spirits of heaven, going out after taking their stand before the Lord of all the earth,

## Zechariah 6:6

With one of which the black horses are going out to the north country;  
And the white ones go out after them,  
While the spotted ones go out to the south country.”

## Zechariah 6:7

When the strong ones went out, they were eager to go to patrol the earth. And He said,  
“Go, patrol the earth.”  
So they patrolled the earth.

## Zechariah 6:8

Then He called out to me and spoke to me, saying,  
“See, those who are going to the land of the north have appeased My wrath in the land of the north.”

## Zechariah 6:9

The word of the Lord also came to me, saying,

## Zechariah 6:10

“Take an offering from the exiles, from Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah; and you are to go to the same day and enter the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have arrived from Babylon.

## Zechariah 6:11

And take silver and gold, make an ornate crown, and place it on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest.

## Zechariah 6:12

Then say to him, ‘This is what the Lord of armies says:  
“Behold, there is a Man whose name is Branch,  
For He will branch out from where He is;  
And He will build the temple of the Lord.

## Zechariah 6:13

Yes, it is He who will build the temple of the Lord,  
And He who will bear honour and sit and rule on His throne.  
So He will be a priest on His throne,  
And the counsel of peace will be between the two offices.”’

## Zechariah 6:14

Now the crown will become a reminder in the temple of the Lord to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah, and Hen the son of Zephaniah.

## Zechariah 6:15

Those who are far away will come and build the temple of the Lord.”  
Then you will know that the Lord of armies has sent me to you. And it will take place if you fully obey the Lord your God.
