# Zechariah Chapter 8

## Zechariah 8:1
The word of the Lord of hosts came to me, saying,

## Zechariah 8:2
This is what the Lord of hosts says: “I am exceedingly jealous for Zion; I am burning with great jealousy for her.”

## Zechariah 8:3
This is what the Lord says: “I will return to Zion and dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. Then Jerusalem will be called the City of Truth, and the mountain of the Lord of hosts will be called the Holy Mountain.”

## Zechariah 8:4
This is what the Lord of hosts says: “Once again, old men and women will sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each with a staff in hand because of their age.

## Zechariah 8:5
And the city squares will be filled with boys and girls playing there.”

## Zechariah 8:6
This is what the Lord of hosts says: “If it seems marvellous to the remnant of this people in those days, will it also seem marvellous to me?” declares the Lord of hosts.

## Zechariah 8:7
This is what the Lord of hosts says: “I will save my people from the lands of the east and the west.

## Zechariah 8:8
I will bring them back to live in Jerusalem; they will be my people, and I will be their God in truth and righteousness.”

## Zechariah 8:9
This is what the Lord of hosts says: “Let your hands be strong, you who hear these words spoken by the prophets who were present when the foundation of the house of the Lord of hosts was laid, so that the temple might be built.

## Zechariah 8:10
Before those days, there were no wages for people or hire for animals. No one could go about their business safely because of their enemies, for I had set everyone against their neighbour.

## Zechariah 8:11
But now I will not treat the remnant of this people as in the former days,” declares the Lord of hosts.

## Zechariah 8:12
“For the seed will be prosperous: the vine will yield its fruit, the land will produce its crops, and the heavens will give their dew. I will give all these things as an inheritance to the remnant of this people.

## Zechariah 8:13
Just as you have been a curse among the nations, house of Judah and house of Israel, so I will save you, and you will be a blessing. Do not fear, but let your hands be strong.”

## Zechariah 8:14
This is what the Lord of hosts says: “Just as I had determined to bring disaster upon you when your ancestors provoked me to anger,” says the Lord of hosts,

## Zechariah 8:15
“so I have determined to do good again to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Do not fear.

## Zechariah 8:16
These are the things you shall do: speak the truth to each other, and render true and sound judgement in your gates;

## Zechariah 8:17
do not plot evil against each other, and do not love perjury. I hate all these things,” declares the Lord.

## Zechariah 8:18
The word of the Lord of hosts came to me, saying,

## Zechariah 8:19
This is what the Lord of hosts says: “The fasts of the fourth, fifth, seventh, and tenth months will become joyful and glad occasions and happy festivals for the house of Judah. Therefore, love truth and peace.”

## Zechariah 8:20
This is what the Lord of hosts says: “Many peoples and the inhabitants of many cities will yet come,

## Zechariah 8:21
and the inhabitants of one city will go to another, saying, ‘Let us go at once to entreat the favour of the Lord and to seek the Lord of hosts. I myself am going.’

## Zechariah 8:22
So many peoples and mighty nations will come to Jerusalem to seek the Lord of hosts and to entreat his favour.”

## Zechariah 8:23
This is what the Lord of hosts says: “In those days, ten people from all languages and nations will take firm hold of one Jew by the hem of his garment and say, ‘Let us go with you, because we have heard that God is with you.’”
