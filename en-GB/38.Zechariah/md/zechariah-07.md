# Zechariah Chapter 7

## Zechariah 7:1
During the fourth year of King Darius, a message from the Lord came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, known as Kislev.

## Zechariah 7:2
The people of Bethel sent Sharezer and Regem-Melek, along with their men, to seek the favour of the Lord,

## Zechariah 7:3
by speaking to the priests of the house of the Lord Almighty and the prophets, asking, “Should I mourn and fast in the fifth month, as I have done for so many years?”

## Zechariah 7:4
Then the word of the Lord Almighty came to me, saying,

## Zechariah 7:5
“Tell all the people of the land and the priests, ‘When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months for these seventy years, was it truly for me that you fasted?

## Zechariah 7:6
And when you eat and drink, do you not eat and drink for yourselves?

## Zechariah 7:7
Are these not the words the Lord proclaimed through the former prophets, when Jerusalem and its surrounding towns were inhabited and prosperous, and the Negev and the foothills were settled?’”

## Zechariah 7:8
And the word of the Lord came again to Zechariah, saying,

## Zechariah 7:9
“This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘Administer true justice; show kindness and compassion to one another.

## Zechariah 7:10
Do not oppress the widow or the orphan, the foreigner or the poor. Do not plot evil against each other in your hearts.’

## Zechariah 7:11
But they refused to listen; they turned a stubborn shoulder and stopped their ears from hearing.

## Zechariah 7:12
They made their hearts as hard as stone, so they would not hear the law or the words that the Lord Almighty had sent by His Spirit through the former prophets. Therefore, great wrath came from the Lord Almighty.

## Zechariah 7:13
“‘When I called, they did not listen; therefore, when they called, I did not respond,’ says the Lord Almighty.

## Zechariah 7:14
‘I scattered them with a storm wind among all the nations they did not know. The land they left behind was so desolate that no one travelled through it. This is how they made the pleasant land desolate.’”
