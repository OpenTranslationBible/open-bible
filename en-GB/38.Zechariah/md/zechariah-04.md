# Zechariah Chapter 4

## Zechariah 4:1
Then the angel who had been conversing with me returned and roused me, as one who is awakened from sleep.

## Zechariah 4:2
He asked me, “What do you see?” I replied, “I see a lampstand made entirely of gold with a bowl on its top and seven lamps on it, with seven channels for the lamps on the top.

## Zechariah 4:3
Also, there are two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl and the other on its left.”

## Zechariah 4:4
I inquired of the angel who was speaking with me, “What are these, my lord?”

## Zechariah 4:5
The angel who was speaking with me responded, “Do you not know what these are?” I said, “No, my lord.”

## Zechariah 4:6
So he said to me, “This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel: ‘Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit,’ declares the Lord of Hosts.

## Zechariah 4:7
‘What are you, mighty mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become level ground. He will bring forth the capstone with shouts of “Grace, grace to it!”’”

## Zechariah 4:8
The message from the Lord came to me, saying,

## Zechariah 4:9
“The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands will also complete it. Then you will know that the Lord of Hosts has sent me to you.

## Zechariah 4:10
For who has despised the day of small things? These seven will rejoice when they see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel—they are the eyes of the Lord which range throughout the earth.”

## Zechariah 4:11
Then I asked him, “What are these two olive trees on the right and left of the lampstand?”

## Zechariah 4:12
And I asked again, “What are these two olive branches beside the two golden pipes that pour out the golden oil?”

## Zechariah 4:13
He replied, “Do you not know what these are?” I said, “No, my lord.”

## Zechariah 4:14
Then he said, “These are the two anointed ones who stand by the Lord of the whole earth.”
