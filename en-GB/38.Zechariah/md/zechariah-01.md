# Zechariah Chapter 1

## Zechariah 1:1

In the eighth month of the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Zechariah, son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, saying:

## Zechariah 1:2

“The Lord was exceedingly angry with your forefathers.

## Zechariah 1:3

Therefore, say to them: This is what the Lord of Hosts says: ‘Return to Me,’ declares the Lord of Hosts, ‘and I will return to you,’ says the Lord of Hosts.

## Zechariah 1:4

Do not be like your forefathers, to whom the former prophets proclaimed: This is what the Lord of Hosts says: ‘Turn from your evil ways and your evil deeds.’ But they did not listen or heed Me,” declares the Lord.

## Zechariah 1:5

“Your forefathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever?

## Zechariah 1:6

But did not My words and My statutes, which I commanded My servants the prophets, overtake your forefathers? Then they repented and said, ‘As the Lord of Hosts has determined to do to us according to our ways and deeds, so He has dealt with us.’”

## Zechariah 1:7

On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Zechariah, son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, as follows:

## Zechariah 1:8

I saw during the night, and behold, a man riding on a red horse, standing among the myrtle trees in the ravine, with red, sorrel, and white horses behind him.

## Zechariah 1:9

Then I said, “What are these, my lord?” And the angel who was speaking with me said, “I will show you what these are.”

## Zechariah 1:10

The man standing among the myrtle trees answered, “These are the ones the Lord has sent to patrol the earth.”

## Zechariah 1:11

And they reported to the angel of the Lord who was standing among the myrtle trees, “We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth is still and quiet.”

## Zechariah 1:12

Then the angel of the Lord said, “Lord of Hosts, how long will You withhold mercy from Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, with which You have been angry these seventy years?”

## Zechariah 1:13

And the Lord responded to the angel who was speaking with me with gracious and comforting words.

## Zechariah 1:14

So the angel who was speaking with me said, “Proclaim, saying: This is what the Lord of Hosts says: ‘I am very jealous for Jerusalem and Zion,

## Zechariah 1:15

and I am exceedingly angry with the nations that are at ease; for while I was only a little angry, they furthered the disaster.’

## Zechariah 1:16

Therefore, this is what the Lord says: ‘I will return to Jerusalem with compassion; My house will be rebuilt in it,’ declares the Lord of Hosts, ‘and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem.’

## Zechariah 1:17

Proclaim further, saying: This is what the Lord of Hosts says: ‘My cities will again overflow with prosperity, and the Lord will again comfort Zion and choose Jerusalem.’”

## Zechariah 1:18

Then I lifted my eyes and looked, and behold, there were four horns.

## Zechariah 1:19

So I asked the angel who was speaking with me, “What are these?” And he said, “These are the horns that have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.”

## Zechariah 1:20

And the Lord showed me four craftsmen.

## Zechariah 1:21

I asked, “What are these coming to do?” And he said, “These are the horns that have scattered Judah so that no one raises his head; but the craftsmen have come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations who have lifted up their horns against the land of Judah to scatter it.”
