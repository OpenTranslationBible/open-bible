> And I will remove the arrogance of the Philistines.

## Zechariah 9:7

> And I will take away their blood from their mouth

> Then they too will belong to our God,  
> And be like a family in Judah,  
> And Ekron like a Jebusite.

## Zechariah 9:8

> Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey.

## Zechariah 9:10

> And I will remove the chariot from Ephraim  
> And the horse from Jerusalem;

> And from the Euphrates River to the ends of the earth.

> This very day I am declaring that I will restore double to you.

## Zechariah 9:13

> I will fill the bow with Ephraim.  
> And I will rouse your sons, Zion, against your sons, Greece;  
> And I will make you like a warrior’s sword.

> And they will devour and trample the slingstones;  
> And they will drink and be exuberant as with wine;  
> And they will be filled like a sacrificial basin,  
> Drenched like the corners of the altar.

## Zechariah 9:16

> And the Lord their God will deliver them on that day  
> As the flock of His people;  
> For they are like the precious stones of a crown,  
> Sparkling on His land.

## Zechariah 9:17

> For how great is His goodness,  
> And how great is His beauty!  
> Grain will make the young men flourish,  
> And new wine, the maidens.
