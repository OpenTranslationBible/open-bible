## Zechariah 9:1

The pronouncement

> Of the word of the Lord is against the land of Hadrach, with Damascus as its resting place—  
> For the eyes of mankind, especially of all the tribes of Israel, are toward the Lord—

## Zechariah 9:2

> And Hamath also, which borders on it;  
> Tyre and Sidon, because they are very wise.

## Zechariah 9:3

> For Tyre built herself a fortress,  
> And piled up silver like dust,  
> And gold like the mud of the streets.

## Zechariah 9:4

> Behold, the Lord will dispossess her  
> And throw her wealth into the sea;  
> And she will be consumed with fire.

## Zechariah 9:5

> Ashkelon will see it and be afraid.  
> Gaza too will writhe in great pain,  
> Also Ekron, because her hope has been ruined.  
> Moreover, the king will perish from Gaza,  
> And Ashkelon will not be inhabited.

## Zechariah 9:6

> And a people of mixed origins will live in Ashdod,  
> And I will eliminate the pride of the Philistines.

## Zechariah 9:7

> And I will remove their blood from their mouth  
> And their detestable things from between their teeth.  
> Then they also will be a remnant for our God,  
> And be like a clan in Judah,  
> And Ekron like a Jebusite.

## Zechariah 9:8

> But I will camp around My house because of an army,  
> Because of one who passes by and returns;  
> And no oppressor will pass over them anymore,  
> For now I have seen with My eyes.

## Zechariah 9:9

> Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion!  
> Shout in triumph, daughter of Jerusalem!  
> Behold, your king is coming to you;  
> He is righteous and endowed with salvation,  
> Humble, and mounted on a donkey,  
> Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey.

## Zechariah 9:10

> And I will eliminate the chariot from Ephraim  
> And the horse from Jerusalem;  
> And the bow of war will be eliminated.  
> And He will speak peace to the nations;  
> And His dominion will be from sea to sea,  
> And from the Euphrates River to the ends of the earth.

## Zechariah 9:11

> As for you also, because of the blood of My covenant with you,  
> I have set your prisoners free from the waterless pit.

## Zechariah 9:12

> Return to the stronghold, you prisoners who have the hope;  
> This very day I am declaring that I will restore double to you.

## Zechariah 9:13

> For I will bend Judah as My bow,  
> I will fill the bow with Ephraim.  
> And I will stir up your sons, Zion, against your sons, Greece;  
> And I will make you like a warrior’s sword.

## Zechariah 9:14

> Then the Lord will appear over them,  
> And His arrow will go forth like lightning;  
> And the Lord God will blow the trumpet,  
> And march in the storm winds of the south.

## Zechariah 9:15

> The Lord of armies will protect them.  
> And they will devour and trample the slingstones;  
> And they will drink and be boisterous as with wine;  
> And they will be filled like a sacrificial basin,  
> Drenched like the corners of the altar.

## Zechariah 9:16

> And the Lord their God will save them on that day  
> As the flock of His people;  
> For they are like the precious stones of a crown,  
> Sparkling on His land.

## Zechariah 9:17

> For how great is His goodness,  
> And how great is His beauty!  
> Grain will make the young men flourish,  
> And new wine, the virgins.
