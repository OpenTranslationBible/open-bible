# Zechariah Chapter 14

## Zechariah 14:1
Behold, a day is approaching for the Lord when your possessions will be plundered and divided within your midst.

## Zechariah 14:2
I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle; the city will be captured, the houses looted, and the women violated. Half of the city will go into exile, but the remainder of the people will not be removed from the city.

## Zechariah 14:3
Then the Lord will go forth and fight against those nations, as He fights on a day of battle.

## Zechariah 14:4
On that day, His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, east of Jerusalem, and the Mount of Olives will be split in two from east to west, forming a vast valley, with one half of the mountain moving north and the other half moving south.

## Zechariah 14:5
You will flee through My mountain valley, for it will extend to Azel. You will flee as you fled from the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the Lord my God will come, and all the holy ones with Him.

## Zechariah 14:6
On that day, there will be no light; the luminaries will dwindle.

## Zechariah 14:7
It will be a unique day, known only to the Lord, without distinction between day and night. When evening comes, there will be light.

## Zechariah 14:8
On that day, living waters will flow out from Jerusalem, half towards the eastern sea and half towards the western sea, in both summer and winter.

## Zechariah 14:9
The Lord will be king over the whole earth. On that day, the Lord will be the only one, and His name the only one.

## Zechariah 14:10
The whole land will be transformed into a plain from Geba to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem. But Jerusalem will be elevated and remain on its site from Benjamin’s Gate to the site of the First Gate, to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king’s winepresses.

## Zechariah 14:11
It will be inhabited, and there will be no more destruction; Jerusalem will dwell in security.

## Zechariah 14:12
This will be the plague with which the Lord will strike all the peoples who fought against Jerusalem: their flesh will rot while they stand on their feet, their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths.

## Zechariah 14:13
On that day, a great panic from the Lord will fall upon them. They will seize each other by the hand and raise their hands against one another.

## Zechariah 14:14
Judah too will fight in Jerusalem, and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be gathered—gold, silver, and garments in great abundance.

## Zechariah 14:15
A similar plague will strike the horses, mules, camels, donkeys, and all the animals in those camps.

## Zechariah 14:16
Then the survivors from all the nations that attacked Jerusalem will go up year after year to worship the King, the Lord of Hosts, and to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles.

## Zechariah 14:17
If any of the families of the earth do not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the Lord of Hosts, they will have no rain.

## Zechariah 14:18
If the family of Egypt does not go up and enter, they will receive no rain. This will be the plague with which the Lord strikes the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles.

## Zechariah 14:19
This will be the punishment of Egypt and the punishment of all the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles.

## Zechariah 14:20
On that day, “Holy to the Lord” will be inscribed on the bells of the horses, and the cooking pots in the Lord’s house will be like the sacred bowls before the altar.

## Zechariah 14:21
Every pot in Jerusalem and Judah will be holy to the Lord of Hosts, and all who come to sacrifice will take some of them and cook in them. On that day, there will no longer be a Canaanite in the house of the Lord of Hosts.
