## 2 Chronicles 29:32

The number of the burnt offerings which the assembly brought was seventy bulls, a hundred rams, and two hundred lambs;  
all these were for a burnt offering to the Lord.

## 2 Chronicles 29:33

And the offerings set apart were six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep.

## 2 Chronicles 29:34

But the priests were too few,  
so that they could not skin all the burnt offerings;  
therefore their brothers the Levites helped them until the work was completed and until the priests had consecrated themselves.  
For the Levites were more conscientious to consecrate themselves than the priests.

## 2 Chronicles 29:35

because the thing came about suddenly.
