# 2 Chronicles Chapter 33

## 2 Chronicles 33:1

Manasseh was twelve years old when he ascended to the throne, and he ruled for fifty-five years in Jerusalem.

## 2 Chronicles 33:2

He did evil in the sight of the Lord, in accordance with the abominations of the nations whom the Lord dispossessed before the sons of Israel.

## 2 Chronicles 33:3

For he rebuilt the high places which his father Hezekiah had torn down;  
he also erected altars for the Baals and made Asherim, and he worshiped all the heavenly lights and served them.

## 2 Chronicles 33:4

He constructed altars in the house of the Lord, about which the Lord had declared, “My name shall be in Jerusalem forever.”

## 2 Chronicles 33:5

He made altars for all the heavenly lights in the two courtyards of the house of the Lord.

## 2 Chronicles 33:6

He also made his sons pass through the fire in the Valley of Ben-hinnom;  
and he practiced witchcraft, used divination, practiced sorcery, and dealt with mediums and spiritists.  
He did great evil in the sight of the Lord, provoking Him to anger.

## 2 Chronicles 33:7

Then he put the carved image of the idol which he had made in the house of God,  
of which God had said to David and to his son Solomon,  
“In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel,  
I will put My name forever;

## 2 Chronicles 33:8

and I will no longer remove the foot of Israel from the land which I have appointed for your fathers,  
if only they will be careful to do all that I have commanded them according to all the Law, the statutes, and the ordinances given through Moses.”

## 2 Chronicles 33:9

So Manasseh misled Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to do more evil than the nations whom the Lord eliminated before the sons of Israel.

---

## 2 Chronicles 33:10

So the Lord communicated with Manasseh and his people, but they disregarded Him.

## 2 Chronicles 33:11

As a result, the Lord allowed the commanders of the army of the king of Assyria to come against them,  
and they captured Manasseh with hooks, bound him with bronze chains, and took him to Babylon.

## 2 Chronicles 33:12

When he was in distress, he sought to appease the Lord his God and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers.

## 2 Chronicles 33:13

When he prayed to Him, He was moved by his entreaty and heard his plea,  
and brought him back to Jerusalem to his kingdom.  
Then Manasseh knew that the Lord alone is God.

---

## 2 Chronicles 33:14

After this he built the outer wall of the city of David on the west side of Gihon, in the valley,  
even to the entrance of the Fish Gate; and he encircled the Ophel with it and made it very high.  
Then he put army commanders in all the fortified cities in Judah.

## 2 Chronicles 33:15

He also took away the foreign gods and the idol from the house of the Lord,  
as well as all the altars which he had built on the mountain of the house of the Lord and in Jerusalem,  
and he cast them outside the city.

## 2 Chronicles 33:16

He restored the altar of the Lord and offered peace offerings and thanksgiving offerings on it;  
and he instructed Judah to serve the Lord God of Israel.

## 2 Chronicles 33:17

Nevertheless, the people still sacrificed on the high places, although only to the Lord their God.

---

## 2 Chronicles 33:18

Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, including his prayer to his God,  
and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of the Lord God of Israel,  
behold, they are among the records of the kings of Israel.

## 2 Chronicles 33:19

His prayer also and how God was moved by him, and all his sin, his unfaithfulness,  
and the sites on which he built high places and erected the Asherim and the carved images,  
before he humbled himself, behold, they are written in the records of the Hozai.

## 2 Chronicles 33:20

So Manasseh lay down with his fathers, and they buried him in his house,  
and his son Amon became king in his place.

---

## 2 Chronicles 33:21

Amon was twenty-two years old when he ascended to the throne, and he ruled for two years in Jerusalem.

## 2 Chronicles 33:22

He did evil in the sight of the Lord, just as his father Manasseh had done.  
And Amon worshipped all the carved images which his father Manasseh had made, and he served them.

## 2 Chronicles 33:23

Moreover, he did not humble himself before the Lord as his father Manasseh had humbled himself,  
but Amon multiplied his guilt.

## 2 Chronicles 33:24

Ultimately, his servants conspired against him and put him to death in his own house.

## 2 Chronicles 33:25

However, the people of the land struck down all the conspirators against King Amon,  
and the people of the land made his son Josiah king in his place.
