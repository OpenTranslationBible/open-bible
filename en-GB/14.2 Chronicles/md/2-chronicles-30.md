# 2 Chronicles Chapter 30

## 2 Chronicles 30:1

Now Hezekiah sent word to all Israel and Judah, and he also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh,  
inviting them to come to the house of the Lord in Jerusalem,  
to celebrate the Passover to the Lord God of Israel.

## 2 Chronicles 30:2

For the king and his officials and all the assembly in Jerusalem had decided to celebrate the Passover in the second month,

## 2 Chronicles 30:3

since they could not celebrate it at that time, because not enough priests had consecrated themselves,  
and the people had not been gathered to Jerusalem.

## 2 Chronicles 30:4

The decision was right in the sight of the king and all the assembly.

## 2 Chronicles 30:5

So they established a decree to circulate a proclamation throughout all Israel,  
from Beersheba even to Dan, that they were to come to celebrate the Passover to the Lord God of Israel in Jerusalem.  
For they had not celebrated it in great numbers as it was prescribed.

## 2 Chronicles 30:6

The couriers went throughout Israel and Judah with the letters from the hand of the king and his officials,  
even according to the command of the king, saying,

“Sons of Israel, return to the Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel,  
so that He may return to those of you who are left, who have escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria.

## 2 Chronicles 30:7

Do not be like your fathers and your brothers,  
who were unfaithful to the Lord God of their fathers,  
so that He made them an object of horror, just as you see.

## 2 Chronicles 30:8

Now do not stiffen your neck like your fathers,  
but yield to the Lord and enter His sanctuary which He has consecrated forever,  
and serve the Lord your God, so that His burning anger may turn away from you.

## 2 Chronicles 30:9

For if you return to the Lord,  
your brothers and your sons will find compassion before those who led them captive and will return to this land.  
For the Lord your God is gracious and compassionate,  
and will not turn His face away from you if you return to Him.”

## 2 Chronicles 30:10

So the couriers passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, and as far as Zebulun,  
but they laughed at them with scorn and mocked them.

## 2 Chronicles 30:11

Nevertheless, some men from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem.

## 2 Chronicles 30:12

The hand of God was also on Judah to give them one heart to do what the king and the officials commanded by the word of the Lord.

## 2 Chronicles 30:13

Now many people were gathered at Jerusalem to celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month,  
a very large assembly.

## 2 Chronicles 30:14

They got up and removed the altars which were in Jerusalem;  
they also removed all the incense altars and threw them into the brook Kidron.

## 2 Chronicles 30:15

Then they slaughtered the Passover lambs on the fourteenth day of the second month.  
And the priests and Levites were ashamed of themselves, and consecrated themselves, and brought burnt offerings to the house of the Lord.

## 2 Chronicles 30:16

They took their places at their posts according to the Law of Moses the man of God;  
the priests sprinkled the blood received from the hand of the Levites.

## 2 Chronicles 30:17

Since there were many in the assembly who had not consecrated themselves,  
the Levites were responsible for slaughtering the Passover lambs for everyone who was unclean,  
so that they might consecrate them to the Lord.

## 2 Chronicles 30:18

For a large number of the people, many from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun,  
had not purified themselves, yet they ate the Passover contrary to what was written.  
For Hezekiah prayed for them, saying,  
“May the good Lord pardon

## 2 Chronicles 30:19

everyone who prepares his heart to seek God, the Lord God of his fathers,  
though not according to the purification rules of the sanctuary.”

## 2 Chronicles 30:20

So the Lord heard Hezekiah and healed the people.

## 2 Chronicles 30:21

The sons of Israel who were present in Jerusalem celebrated the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with great joy,  
and the Levites and the priests praised the Lord day after day with loud instruments to the Lord.

---

## 2 Chronicles 30:22

Then Hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites who showed good insight in the things of the Lord.  
So they ate for the appointed seven days, sacrificing peace offerings and giving thanks to the Lord God of their fathers.

---

## 2 Chronicles 30:23

Then the whole assembly decided to celebrate the feast another seven days,  
so they celebrated the seven days with joy.

## 2 Chronicles 30:24

For Hezekiah king of Judah had contributed for the assembly a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep,  
and the leaders had contributed for the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep;  
and a large number of priests consecrated themselves.

## 2 Chronicles 30:25

All the assembly of Judah rejoiced, with the priests and the Levites and all the assembly that came from Israel,  
both the strangers who came from the land of Israel and those living in Judah.

## 2 Chronicles 30:26

So there was great joy in Jerusalem,  
because there was nothing like this in Jerusalem since the days of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel.

## 2 Chronicles 30:27

Then the Levitical priests stood and blessed the people;  
and their voice was heard, and their prayer came to His holy dwelling place, to heaven.
