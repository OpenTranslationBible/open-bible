Joash acted rightly in the eyes of the Lord throughout the lifetime of Jehoiada the priest.

And he gathered the priests and Levites and said to them,  
“Go out to the cities of Judah and collect money from all Israel to repair the house of your God annually, and you shall do the work quickly.”  
But the Levites did not act quickly.

## 2 Chronicles 24:6

So the king summoned Jehoiada the chief priest and said to him,

Whenever the chest was brought in to the king’s officer by the Levites, and when they saw that there was a large amount of money,  
the king’s scribe and the chief priest’s officer would come and empty the chest, then take it and return it to its place.  
They did this daily, and collected a large amount of money.

---

## 2 Chronicles 24:12

The king and Jehoiada gave it to those who did the work of the service of the house of the Lord.

So the workmen laboured, and the restoration work progressed in their hands,  
and they restored the house of God according to its specifications, and strengthened it.

---

## 2 Chronicles 24:14

When they had finished, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada,  
and it was made into utensils for the house of the Lord—utensils for the service and for the burnt offering, and pans and utensils of gold and silver.  
And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the Lord continually all the days of Jehoiada.

---

## 2 Chronicles 24:15

But Jehoiada grew old and died, being full of days; he was 130 years old at his death.

---

---

## 2 Chronicles 24:17

However, after Jehoiada's death, the officials of Judah came and bowed down to the king, and the king heeded their advice.

---

## 2 Chronicles 24:18

They abandoned the house of the Lord, the God of their fathers, and served the Asherim and the idols;  
so wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this guilt of theirs.

---

## 2 Chronicles 24:19

Yet He sent prophets to them to bring them back to the Lord;  
though they testified against them, they would not listen.

---

## 2 Chronicles 24:20

Then the Spirit of God came on Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest; and he stood above the people and said to them,  
“This is what God has said: ‘Why do you break the commandments of the Lord and do not prosper? Because you have abandoned the Lord, He has also abandoned you.’”

---

## 2 Chronicles 24:21

So they plotted against him, and by the king's command, they stoned him to death in the courtyard of the temple of the Lord.

---

## 2 Chronicles 24:22

So King Joash did not remember the kindness which his father Jehoiada had shown him,  
but he killed his son. And as he was dying, he said,  
“May the Lord see and avenge!”

---

## 2 Chronicles 24:23

Now it happened at the turn of the year that the army of the Arameans came up against Joash,  
and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, destroyed all the officials of the people from among the people, and sent all their spoils to the king of Damascus.

---

## 2 Chronicles 24:24

Indeed, the army of the Arameans came with a small number of men;  
yet the Lord handed over a very great army to them, because they had abandoned the Lord, the God of their fathers.  
So they executed judgment on Joash.

---

## 2 Chronicles 24:25

When they had left him—because they left him very sick—his own servants conspired against him because of the blood of the son of Jehoiada the priest,  
and they murdered him on his bed. So he died, and they buried him in the city of David, but they did not bury him in the tombs of the kings.

---

## 2 Chronicles 24:26

Now these are those who conspired against him:  
Zabad the son of Shimeath the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith the Moabitess.

## 2 Chronicles 24:27

As to his sons, the many oracles against him, and the restoration of the house of God, behold, they are written in the treatise of the Book of the Kings.  
Then his son Amaziah became king in his place.
