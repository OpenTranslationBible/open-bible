‘This is what the Lord declares:  
Behold, I am bringing calamity on this place and on its inhabitants,  
all the curses written in the book which they have read in the presence of the king of Judah,

## 2 Chronicles 34:25

because they have abandoned Me and have burned incense to other gods,  
so that they would provoke Me to anger with all the works of their hands;  
therefore My wrath will be poured out on this place, and it will not be quenched.’

## 2 Chronicles 34:26

But to the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of the Lord, this is what you shall say to him:  
‘This is what the Lord, the God of Israel says regarding the words which you have heard:

## 2 Chronicles 34:27

Because your heart was tender and you humbled yourself before God when you heard His words against this place and its inhabitants,  
and because you humbled yourself before Me, tore your clothes, and wept before Me,  
I truly have heard you,’ declares the Lord.

## 2 Chronicles 34:28

‘Behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you will be gathered to your grave in peace,  
and your eyes will not see all the evil which I am bringing on this place and on its inhabitants.’”
