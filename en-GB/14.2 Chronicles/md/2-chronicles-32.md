When Hezekiah realised that Sennacherib had come and planned to make war against Jerusalem,

## 2 Chronicles 32:3

he decided with his officers and his warriors to block off the water supply from the springs which were outside the city, and they helped him.

## 2 Chronicles 32:4

Therefore, a large assembly gathered and blocked all the springs and the stream that flowed through the land, saying,  
“Why should the kings of Assyria come and find an abundance of water?”

## 2 Chronicles 32:5

And he took courage and rebuilt all the wall that had been broken down, and erected towers on it,  
and built another outside wall and strengthened the Millo in the city of David, and made weapons and shields in great numbers.

Hezekiah appointed military officers over the people, gathered them to him in the square at the city gate, and spoke to them with encouragement, saying,

## 2 Chronicles 32:7

“Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or discouraged because of the king of Assyria nor because of all the multitude that is with him;  
for the One with us is greater than the one with him.

## 2 Chronicles 32:8

With him is only human strength, but with us is the Lord our God,  
to help us and to fight our battles.”  
And the people relied on the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.

## 2 Chronicles 32:10

“This is what Sennacherib king of Assyria says:  
‘On what are you trusting, that you are remaining in Jerusalem under siege?

## 2 Chronicles 32:11

Is Hezekiah not deceiving you to surrender yourselves to die by hunger and by thirst, saying,  
“The Lord our God will save us from the hand of the king of Assyria”?

## 2 Chronicles 32:12

Has the same Hezekiah not taken away His high places and His altars,  
and said to Judah and Jerusalem,  
“You shall worship before one altar, and on it you shall burn incense”?

## 2 Chronicles 32:13

Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands?  
Were the gods of the nations of the lands able at all to save their land from my hand?

## 2 Chronicles 32:14

Who was there among all the gods of these nations which my fathers utterly destroyed  
who could save his people from my hand,  
that your God would be able to save you from my hand?

## 2 Chronicles 32:15

Now then, do not let Hezekiah deceive you or mislead you in this way,  
and do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to save his people from my hand or from the hand of my fathers.  
How much less will your God save you from my hand?’”

His servants said even more against the Lord God and against His servant Hezekiah.

## 2 Chronicles 32:17

He also wrote letters to taunt the Lord God of Israel,

“As the gods of the nations of the lands have not saved their people from my hand,  
so the God of Hezekiah will not save His people from my hand.”

## 2 Chronicles 32:18

They shouted this with a loud voice in the language of Judah to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall,  
to frighten and terrify them, so that they might capture the city.

## 2 Chronicles 32:19

They spoke of the God of Jerusalem as of the gods of the peoples of the earth,  
the work of human hands.

However, King Hezekiah and Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, prayed about this and cried out to heaven.

## 2 Chronicles 32:21

And the Lord sent an angel who eliminated every mighty warrior, commander, and officer in the camp of the king of Assyria.  
So he returned in shame to his own land.  
And when he had entered the temple of his god, some of his own children killed him there with the sword.

and from the hand of all others, and guided them on every side.

## 2 Chronicles 32:23

In those days Hezekiah became seriously ill; and he prayed to the Lord,  
and the Lord spoke to him and gave him a sign.

## 2 Chronicles 32:25

But Hezekiah did not respond appropriately to the benefit he received, because his heart was proud;  
therefore wrath came on him and on Judah and Jerusalem.

## 2 Chronicles 32:26

Nevertheless, Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem humbled themselves,  
and thus the wrath of the Lord did not come upon them during Hezekiah's lifetime.

Hezekiah possessed immense riches and honour; and he made for himself treasuries for silver, gold, precious stones, spices, shields, and all kinds of valuable articles,

He also made cities for himself, and acquired flocks and herds in abundance,  
because God had given him very great wealth.

It was Hezekiah who stopped the upper outlet of the waters of Gihon  
and directed them to the west side of the city of David.  
And Hezekiah succeeded in everything that he did.

## 2 Chronicles 32:31

Even in the matter of the envoys of the rulers of Babylon,  
who were sent to him to inquire of the wonder that had happened in the land,  
God left him alone only to test him, so that He might know everything that was in his heart.

## 2 Chronicles 32:32

Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his deeds of devotion, behold,  
they are recorded in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz,  
in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.

## 2 Chronicles 32:33

So Hezekiah lay down with his fathers, and they buried him in the upper section of the tombs of the sons of David;  
and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem honoured him at his death.  
And his son Manasseh became king in his place.
