Now when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and that he intended to wage war against Jerusalem,

## 2 Chronicles 32:3

he decided with his officers and his warriors to block off the water supply from the springs which were outside the city, and they helped him.

## 2 Chronicles 32:4

So many people assembled and stopped up all the springs and the stream which flowed through the region, saying,  
“Why should the kings of Assyria come and find abundant water?”

## 2 Chronicles 32:5

And he took courage and rebuilt all the wall that had been broken down, and erected towers on it,  
and built another outside wall and strengthened the Millo in the city of David, and made weapons and shields in great numbers.

## 2 Chronicles 32:7

“Be strong and courageous, do not fear or be dismayed because of the king of Assyria nor because of all the multitude that is with him;  
for the One with us is greater than the one with him.

## 2 Chronicles 32:8

With him is only an arm of flesh, but with us is the Lord our God,  
to help us and to fight our battles.”

## 2 Chronicles 32:10

“This is what Sennacherib king of Assyria says:  
‘On what are you trusting, that you are remaining in Jerusalem under siege?

## 2 Chronicles 32:11

Is Hezekiah not misleading you to give yourselves over to die by hunger and by thirst, saying,  
“The Lord our God will save us from the hand of the king of Assyria”?

## 2 Chronicles 32:12

Has the same Hezekiah not taken away His high places and His altars,  
and said to Judah and Jerusalem,  
“You shall worship before one altar, and on it you shall burn incense”?

## 2 Chronicles 32:13

Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the lands?  
Were the gods of the nations of the lands able at all to save their land from my hand?

## 2 Chronicles 32:14

Who was there among all the gods of these nations which my fathers utterly destroyed  
who could save his people from my hand,  
that your God would be able to save you from my hand?

## 2 Chronicles 32:15

Now then, do not let Hezekiah deceive you or mislead you in this way,  
and do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to save his people from my hand or from the hand of my fathers.  
How much less will your God save you from my hand?’”

His servants said even more against the Lord God and against His servant Hezekiah.

## 2 Chronicles 32:17

He also wrote letters to taunt the Lord God of Israel,

“As the gods of the nations of the lands have not saved their people from my hand,  
so the God of Hezekiah will not save His people from my hand.”

## 2 Chronicles 32:18

They called this out with a loud voice in the language of Judah to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall,  
to frighten and terrify them, so that they might take the city.

## 2 Chronicles 32:19

They spoke of the God of Jerusalem as of the gods of the peoples of the earth,  
the work of human hands.

But King Hezekiah and Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, prayed about this and cried out to heaven.

## 2 Chronicles 32:21

And the Lord sent an angel who eliminated every mighty warrior, commander, and officer in the camp of the king of Assyria.  
So he returned in shame to his own land.  
And when he had entered the temple of his god, some of his own children killed him there with the sword.

and from the hand of all others, and guided them on every side.

In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill; and he prayed to the Lord,  
and the Lord spoke to him and gave him a sign.

## 2 Chronicles 32:25

But Hezekiah gave no return for the benefit he received, because his heart was proud;  
therefore wrath came on him and on Judah and Jerusalem.

## 2 Chronicles 32:26

However, Hezekiah humbled the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem,  
so that the wrath of the Lord did not come on them in the days of Hezekiah.

Now Hezekiah had immense riches and honor; and he made for himself treasuries for silver, gold, precious stones, spices, shields, and all kinds of valuable articles,

## 2 Chronicles 32:28

storehouses also for the produce of grain, wine, and oil, pens for all kinds of cattle, and sheepfolds for the flocks.

## 2 Chronicles 32:29

He also made cities for himself, and acquired flocks and herds in abundance,  
because God had given him very great wealth.

## 2 Chronicles 32:30

It was Hezekiah who stopped the upper outlet of the waters of Gihon  
and directed them to the west side of the city of David.  
And Hezekiah was successful in everything that he did.

## 2 Chronicles 32:31

Even in the matter of the envoys of the rulers of Babylon,  
who were sent to him to inquire of the wonder that had happened in the land,  
God left him alone only to test him, so that He might know everything that was in his heart.

## 2 Chronicles 32:32

Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his deeds of devotion, behold,  
they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz,  
in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.

## 2 Chronicles 32:33

So Hezekiah lay down with his fathers, and they buried him in the upper section of the tombs of the sons of David;  
and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem honored him at his death.  
And his son Manasseh became king in his place.
