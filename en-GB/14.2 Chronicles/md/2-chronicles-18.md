Some years later he went down to Ahab in Samaria. And Ahab slaughtered many sheep and oxen for him and the people who were with him, and he induced him to go up against Ramoth-gilead.

---

## 2 Chronicles 18:3

Ahab, king of Israel, asked Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, “Will you join me in battle against Ramoth-gilead?” And he replied, “I am as you are, and my people as your people, and we will stand with you in the battle.”

Jehoshaphat, however, said to the king of Israel, “Let us first seek the counsel of the Lord.”

---

## 2 Chronicles 18:5

So the king of Israel assembled the prophets, four hundred men, and said to them, “Shall we go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I refrain?” And they said, “Go up, for God will hand it over to the king.”

---

## 2 Chronicles 18:6

But Jehoshaphat said, “Is there no longer a prophet of the Lord here, so that we may inquire of him?”

---

## 2 Chronicles 18:7

Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is still one man by whom we may inquire of the Lord, but I hate him, because he never prophesies anything good regarding me, but only bad. He is Micaiah, son of Imla.” But Jehoshaphat said, “May the king not say so.”

---

## 2 Chronicles 18:8

Then the king of Israel summoned an officer and said, “Bring Micaiah son of Imla quickly.”

---

## 2 Chronicles 18:9

Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting each on his throne, dressed in their robes, and they were sitting at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.

## 2 Chronicles 18:10

Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah crafted horns of iron for himself and declared, “This is what the Lord says: ‘With these you will gore the Arameans until they are vanquished!’”

---

## 2 Chronicles 18:11

All the prophets were prophesying this as well, saying, “Go up to Ramoth-gilead and succeed, for the Lord will hand it over to the king.”

---

## 2 Chronicles 18:12

Then the messenger who went to summon Micaiah spoke to him, saying, “Behold, the words of the prophets are unanimously favourable to the king. So please let your word be like one of them, and speak favourably.”

---

## 2 Chronicles 18:13

But Micaiah said, “As surely as the Lord lives, I will speak whatever my God says.”

---

## 2 Chronicles 18:14

When he came to the king, the king said to him, “Micaiah, shall we go to battle against Ramoth-gilead, or shall I refrain?” He said, “Go up and succeed, for they will be handed over to you!”

---

## 2 Chronicles 18:15

Then the king said to him, “How many times must I make you swear that you will not tell me anything but the truth in the name of the Lord?”

---

## 2 Chronicles 18:16

So he said, “I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, like sheep that have no shepherd; and the Lord said, ‘These have no master. Each of them is to return to his house in peace.’”

---

## 2 Chronicles 18:17

Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Did I not say to you that he would not prophesy anything good regarding me, but only bad?”

---

## 2 Chronicles 18:18

Micaiah said, “Therefore, hear the word of the Lord. I saw the Lord sitting on His throne, and all the angels of heaven standing on His right and on His left.

---

## 2 Chronicles 18:19

And the Lord said, ‘Who will entice Ahab king of Israel to go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?’ And one said this, while another said that.

---

## 2 Chronicles 18:20

Then a spirit came forward and stood before the Lord and said, ‘I will persuade him.’ And the Lord said to him, ‘In what way?’

---

## 2 Chronicles 18:21

He said, ‘I will go and be a deceiving spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’ Then He said, ‘You shall entice him, and you will also prevail. Go and do so.’

---

## 2 Chronicles 18:22

Now then, behold, the Lord has put a deceiving spirit in the mouth of these your prophets; for the Lord has proclaimed disaster against you.”

---

## 2 Chronicles 18:23

Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came up and struck Micaiah on the cheek and said, “How did the Spirit of the Lord pass from me to speak to you?”

---

## 2 Chronicles 18:24

Micaiah said, “Behold, you are going to see on that day when you go from one inner room to another to hide yourself.”

---

## 2 Chronicles 18:25

Then the king of Israel said, “Take Micaiah and return him to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son,

---

## 2 Chronicles 18:26

and say, ‘This is what the king says: “Put this man in prison, and feed him only bread and water until I return safely.”’”

---

## 2 Chronicles 18:27

But Micaiah said, “If you indeed return safely, the Lord has not spoken by me.” And he said, “Listen, all you people!”

---

## 2 Chronicles 18:28

Thus, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, proceeded to Ramoth-gilead.

---

## 2 Chronicles 18:29

And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you put on your royal attire.” So the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went into battle.

---

## 2 Chronicles 18:30

Now the king of Aram had commanded the captains of his chariots, saying, “Do not fight with anyone small or great, except the king of Israel alone.”

---

## 2 Chronicles 18:31

So when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “It is the king of Israel!” And they turned to fight against him, but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the Lord helped him, and God diverted them from him.

---

## 2 Chronicles 18:32

When the captains of the chariots realised it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.

---

## 2 Chronicles 18:33

Now a man drew his bow at random and struck the king of Israel in a joint of the armour.  
So he said to the driver of the chariot, “Turn around and take me out of the battle, for I am severely wounded.”

---

## 2 Chronicles 18:34

The battle raged on that day, and the king of Israel held himself up in his chariot against the Arameans until the evening;  
and at sunset he died.
