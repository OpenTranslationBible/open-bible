# James Chapter 3

## James 3:1
Not many of you should aspire to be teachers, my brothers and sisters, because you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness.

## James 3:2
We all stumble in various ways. If anyone does not stumble in what they say, they are perfect, capable of controlling the whole body as well.

## James 3:3
When we place bits in the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we can guide their entire bodies.

## James 3:4
Consider ships as well: despite their size and being driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot desires.

## James 3:5
Similarly, the tongue is a small part of the body, yet it boasts of great things. See how a large forest can be set ablaze by a small spark!

## James 3:6
The tongue is also a fire, a world of iniquity among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole body, sets the course of one's life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell.

## James 3:7
All kinds of animals, birds, reptiles, and sea creatures are tamed and have been tamed by humanity,

## James 3:8
but no human can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.

## James 3:9
With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people, who are made in God's likeness.

## James 3:10
Out of the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers and sisters, this ought not to be so.

## James 3:11
Can a spring produce both fresh and bitter water from the same opening?

## James 3:12
My brothers and sisters, can a fig tree produce olives, or a grapevine produce figs? Neither can a salt spring yield fresh water.

## James 3:13
Who among you is wise and understanding? Let them demonstrate it by their good conduct, through deeds done in the humility that wisdom brings.

## James 3:14
But if you nurture bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast about it or deny the truth.

## James 3:15
Such wisdom does not come from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, and demonic.

## James 3:16
For where envy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder and every evil practice.

## James 3:17
But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peace-loving, gentle, willing to yield, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial and sincere.

## James 3:18
Those who promote peace sow seeds of peace and reap a harvest of righteousness.
