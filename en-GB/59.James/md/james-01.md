# James Chapter 1

## James 1:1

James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes dispersed among the nations: Greetings.

## James 1:2

Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you encounter various trials,

## James 1:3

for you understand that the testing of your faith creates perseverance.

## James 1:4

Let endurance have its perfect work, so that you may be mature and complete, lacking in nothing.

## James 1:5

If any of you lacks wisdom, let them ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given to them.

## James 1:6

But you must ask in faith, without doubting, because the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven and tossed by the wind.

## James 1:7

Such individuals should not anticipate receiving anything from the Lord.

## James 1:8

They are double-minded and unstable in all their ways.

## James 1:9

Believers in humble circumstances should take pride in their high position;

## James 1:10

but the rich should take pride in their humiliation, since they will pass away like a wild flower.

## James 1:11

For the sun rises with scorching heat and withers the grass; its flower falls and its beauty is destroyed. In the same way, the rich will fade away even while they go about their business.

## James 1:12

Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial; for having stood the test, they will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love Him.

## James 1:13

When tempted, no one should say, “I am being tempted by God.” For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He tempt anyone;

## James 1:14

but each person is tempted when they are carried away and enticed by their own evil desire.

## James 1:15

Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death.

## James 1:16

Do not be led astray, my dear brothers and sisters.

## James 1:17

Every good and perfect gift is from above, descending from the Father of the heavenly lights, who remains constant and unchanging.

## James 1:18

By His own will, He brought us forth through the word of truth, so that we might be a kind of firstfruits of all He created.

## James 1:19

My beloved brothers and sisters, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to become angry;

## James 1:20

because human anger does not achieve the righteousness that God desires.

## James 1:21

Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent, and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save your souls.

## James 1:22

Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Be doers of the word.

## James 1:23

Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like someone who looks at their face in a mirror

## James 1:24

and, after looking at themselves, goes away and immediately forgets what they look like.

## James 1:25

But whoever looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues in it—not forgetting what they have heard, but doing it—will find blessing in their actions.

## James 1:26

Those who consider themselves religious and yet do not keep a tight rein on their tongues deceive themselves, and their religion is without value.

## James 1:27

Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself unpolluted by the world.
