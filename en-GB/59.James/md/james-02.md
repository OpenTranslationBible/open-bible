# James Chapter 2

## James 2:1
My brothers and sisters, believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ should not hold their faith with an attitude of personal favouritism.

## James 2:2
Suppose a man enters your assembly wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in shabby clothes also comes in.

## James 2:3
If you pay special attention to the man wearing the fine clothes and say, “Here’s a good seat for you,” but tell the poor man, “You stand over there” or “Sit by my footstool,”

## James 2:4
have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil motives?

## James 2:5
Listen, my dear brothers and sisters: Has God not chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom He promised to those who love Him?

## James 2:6
But you have dishonoured the poor. Is it not the rich who oppress you and drag you into court?

## James 2:7
Do they not blaspheme the noble name by which you have been called?

## James 2:8
If you truly keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbour as yourself,” you are doing well.

## James 2:9
But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers.

## James 2:10
For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at one point is guilty of breaking all of it.

## James 2:11
For He who said, “Do not commit adultery,” also said, “Do not murder.” If you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a violator of the law.

## James 2:12
So speak and act as those who are to be judged by the law that gives freedom.

## James 2:13
For judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful. Mercy triumphs over judgment.

## James 2:14
What benefit is there, my brothers and sisters, if someone professes to have faith but lacks deeds? Can that kind of faith save them?

## James 2:15
If a brother or sister lacks clothing and daily food,

## James 2:16
and one of you says to them, “Go in peace; keep warm and well fed,” but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it?

## James 2:17
In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by works, is dead.

## James 2:18
But someone might say, “You have faith and I have works.” Show me your faith without works, and I will show you my faith by my works.

## James 2:19
You acknowledge that there is one God. Well done! Even the demons acknowledge that—and tremble.

## James 2:20
You foolish person, do you want evidence that faith without works is useless?

## James 2:21
Was not our father Abraham justified by works when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?

## James 2:22
You see that his faith and his actions were in harmony, and his faith was brought to completion by what he did.

## James 2:23
And the scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness,” and he was called a friend of God.

## James 2:24
You see that a person is justified by what they do and not by faith alone.

## James 2:25
In the same way, was not Rahab the prostitute justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them off by a different route?

## James 2:26
Just as the body without the spirit is lifeless, so faith without works is lifeless.
