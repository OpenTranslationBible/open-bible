# James Chapter 5

## James 5:1
Now, you wealthy individuals, listen and lament for the miseries that are about to befall you.

## James 5:2
Your riches have decayed, and your garments have become moth-eaten.

## James 5:3
Your gold and silver have rusted, and their rust will serve as evidence against you and will consume your flesh like fire. You have amassed wealth in the last days.

## James 5:4
Behold, the wages you have withheld from the labourers who mowed your fields cry out against you; the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of Hosts.

## James 5:5
You have indulged in luxury and pleasure on the earth; you have fattened your hearts for the day of slaughter.

## James 5:6
You have condemned and killed the righteous person; he does not resist you.

## James 5:7
Therefore, be patient, brothers and sisters, until the Lord's coming. Consider how the farmer waits for the precious yield of the soil, patiently waiting for the early and late rains.

## James 5:8
You too must be patient and strengthen your hearts, for the Lord's coming is near.

## James 5:9
Do not grumble against one another, brothers and sisters, so that you may not be judged. Behold, the Judge is standing at the door.

## James 5:10
Take, as an example of suffering and patience, brothers and sisters, the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.

## James 5:11
Indeed, we consider those blessed who have endured. You have heard of Job's endurance and have seen the outcome of the Lord's dealings, that the Lord is full of compassion and mercy.

## James 5:12
Above all, my brothers and sisters, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath. Let your "Yes" be yes, and your "No" be no, so that you may not fall under condemnation.

## James 5:13
Is anyone among you suffering? Let them pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let them sing praises.

## James 5:14
Is anyone among you ill? Let them call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over them, anointing them with oil in the name of the Lord.

## James 5:15
And the prayer of faith will restore the one who is ill, and the Lord will raise them up; if they have committed sins, they will be forgiven.

## James 5:16
Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.

## James 5:17
Elijah was a human being like us, and he prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the land for three years and six months.

## James 5:18
Then he prayed again, and the heavens gave rain, and the earth produced its crops.

## James 5:19
My brothers and sisters, if anyone among you wanders from the truth and someone brings them back,

## James 5:20
remember this: whoever turns a sinner from the error of their way will save their soul from death and cover over a multitude of sins.
