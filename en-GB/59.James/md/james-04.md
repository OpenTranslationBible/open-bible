# James Chapter 4

## James 4:1

What is the cause of fights and disputes among you? Do they not arise from your desires that wage war within your members?

## James 4:2

You desire and do not possess, so you commit murder. You covet and cannot obtain, so you quarrel and fight. You do not have because you do not ask God.

## James 4:3

When you ask, you do not receive, because you ask with improper motives, so that you may spend it on your pleasures.

## James 4:4

You adulterous people, do you not realise that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore, anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.

## James 4:5

Or do you think that the Scripture speaks without reason when it says that He jealously desires the spirit He has made to dwell in us?

## James 4:6

But He gives us greater grace. This is why the Scripture says:

> “God opposes the proud
> but gives grace to the humble.”

## James 4:7

So, place yourselves under God's authority. Stand against the devil, and he will flee from you.

## James 4:8

Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.

## James 4:9

Be afflicted, mourn, and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom.

## James 4:10

Humble yourselves before the Lord, and He will exalt you.

## James 4:11

Brothers and sisters, do not speak against one another. Anyone who speaks against a brother or sister or judges them speaks against the law and judges it. If you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge of it.

## James 4:12

There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the One who is able to save and destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbour?

## James 4:13

Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city, spend a year there, do business and make a profit.”

## James 4:14

Yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow. You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.

## James 4:15

Rather, you should say, “If it is the Lord’s will, we will live and do this or that.”

## James 4:16

But as it stands, you boast in your arrogant schemes. All such boasting is evil.

## James 4:17

Therefore, if anyone knows the good they ought to do and does not do it, it is sin for them.
