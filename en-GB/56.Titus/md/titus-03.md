# Titus Chapter 3

## Titus 3:1
Remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, ready for every good work,

## Titus 3:2
to speak evil of no one, to avoid quarrelling, to be gentle, showing perfect courtesy towards all people.

## Titus 3:3
For we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, enslaved by various passions and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, detesting one another.

## Titus 3:4
Yet, when the kindness and love of God our Saviour was revealed,

## Titus 3:5
He saved us, not because of deeds done by us in righteousness, but according to His mercy, through the washing of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit,

## Titus 3:6
whom He poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour,

## Titus 3:7
so that, having been justified by His grace, we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.

## Titus 3:8
This saying is trustworthy, and I want you to insist on these things, so that those who have believed in God may be careful to devote themselves to good works. These things are excellent and beneficial for everyone.

## Titus 3:9
But avoid foolish controversies, genealogies, dissensions, and disputes about the law, for they are unprofitable and futile.

## Titus 3:10
Warn a divisive person once, and then warn them a second time. After that, have nothing more to do with them,

## Titus 3:11
knowing that such a person is perverted and sinful, being self-condemned.

## Titus 3:12
When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, do your utmost to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.

## Titus 3:13
Diligently assist Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey, ensuring they lack nothing.

## Titus 3:14
Our people must learn to devote themselves to good works to meet urgent needs, so that they will not be unproductive.

## Titus 3:15
All who are with me send you greetings. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all.
