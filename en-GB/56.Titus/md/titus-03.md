# Titus Chapter 3

## Titus 3:1

Remind them to be subject to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good deed,

## Titus 3:2

to slander no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing every consideration for all people.

## Titus 3:3

For we too were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, enslaved to various lusts and pleasures, spending our life in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.

## Titus 3:4

But when the kindness of God our Saviour and His love for mankind appeared,

## Titus 3:5

He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we did in righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit,

## Titus 3:6

whom He richly poured out upon us through Jesus Christ our Saviour,

## Titus 3:7

so that being justified by His grace we would be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.

## Titus 3:8

This statement is trustworthy; and concerning these things I want you to speak confidently, so that those who have believed God will be careful to engage in good deeds. These things are good and beneficial for people.

## Titus 3:9

But avoid foolish controversies, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the Law, for they are useless and worthless.

## Titus 3:10

Reject a divisive person after a first and second warning,

## Titus 3:11

knowing that such a person has deviated from the truth and is sinning, being self-condemned.

## Titus 3:12

When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, make every effort to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.

## Titus 3:13

Diligently help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way so that nothing is lacking for them.

## Titus 3:14

Our people must also learn to engage in good deeds to meet pressing needs, so that they will not be unproductive.

## Titus 3:15

All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in the faith.  
Grace be with you all.
