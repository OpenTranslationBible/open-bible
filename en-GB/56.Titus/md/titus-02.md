# Titus Chapter 2

## Titus 2:1
As for you, communicate what aligns with sound doctrine.

## Titus 2:2
Older men should be temperate, dignified, self-controlled, sound in faith, in love, and in perseverance.

## Titus 2:3
Similarly, older women should conduct themselves with reverence, avoiding slander and excessive wine, and should teach what is good.

## Titus 2:4
This way, they can encourage the younger women to love their husbands and children,

## Titus 2:5
to be sensible, pure, diligent at home, kind, and submissive to their own husbands, so that the word of God is not discredited.

## Titus 2:6
In the same way, urge the young men to be sensible.

## Titus 2:7
In all respects, show yourself as an example of good deeds, with integrity in teaching, dignified,

## Titus 2:8
sound in speech that is beyond reproach, so that any opponent may be ashamed, having nothing negative to say about us.

## Titus 2:9
Encourage slaves to be obedient to their masters in everything, to be pleasing, not argumentative,

## Titus 2:10
and not to pilfer, but to demonstrate complete trustworthiness, so that they may enhance the teaching of God our Saviour in every way.

## Titus 2:11
For the grace of God has appeared, offering salvation to all people,

## Titus 2:12
teaching us to renounce ungodliness and worldly desires, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in this present age,

## Titus 2:13
as we await the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Saviour, Jesus Christ,

## Titus 2:14
who gave Himself for us to redeem us from all iniquity and to purify for Himself a people of His own, eager to do good deeds.

## Titus 2:15
These are the things you should speak, encourage, and rebuke with all authority. Let no one disregard you.
