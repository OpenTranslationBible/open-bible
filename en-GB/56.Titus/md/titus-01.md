# Titus Chapter 1

## Titus 1:1
Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the faith of God's chosen and the knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness—

## Titus 1:2
in the hope of eternal life, which God, who does not lie, promised long ages ago,

## Titus 1:3
and now, at the appointed time, has revealed through the proclamation entrusted to me by the command of God our Saviour,

## Titus 1:4
To Titus, my true son in our shared faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour.

## Titus 1:5
The reason I left you in Crete was so that you might set right what was left unfinished and appoint elders in every town, as I directed you.

## Titus 1:6
An elder must be blameless, the husband of one wife, with children who believe and are not accused of being wild or disobedient.

## Titus 1:7
Since an overseer is God’s steward, he must be blameless—not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not given to excess in wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain.

## Titus 1:8
Instead, he must be hospitable, a lover of what is good, self-controlled, upright, holy, and disciplined.

## Titus 1:9
He must hold firmly to the faithful message as it has been taught, so that he can encourage others with sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it.

## Titus 1:10
For there are many rebellious people, empty talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision group.

## Titus 1:11
They must be silenced, because they are upsetting whole households by teaching things they ought not to teach—for the sake of dishonest gain.

## Titus 1:12
One of their own prophets has said, “Cretans are always liars, evil brutes, lazy gluttons.”

## Titus 1:13
This testimony is true. Therefore, rebuke them sharply, so that they may be sound in the faith

## Titus 1:14
and not pay attention to Jewish myths or the commands of men who turn away from the truth.

## Titus 1:15
To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who are corrupted and unbelieving, nothing is pure. Indeed, both their minds and consciences are corrupted.

## Titus 1:16
They profess to know God, but by their actions they deny Him. They are detestable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work.
