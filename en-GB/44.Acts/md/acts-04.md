# Acts Chapter 4

## Acts 4:1

While they were addressing the people, the priests, the captain of the temple guard, and the Sadducees approached them,

## Acts 4:2

being greatly troubled because the apostles were instructing the people and proclaiming the resurrection of the dead through Jesus.

## Acts 4:3

They apprehended Peter and John and, as it was already evening, placed them in custody until the following day.

## Acts 4:4

However, many who heard the message believed, and the number of men who believed grew to about five thousand.

## Acts 4:5

The next day, the rulers, elders, and scribes assembled in Jerusalem.

## Acts 4:6

Annas the high priest was present, along with Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and others of the high priestly lineage.

## Acts 4:7

They had Peter and John brought before them and began to question them: “By what power or in what name have you done this?”

## Acts 4:8

Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, addressed them: “Rulers and elders of the people,

## Acts 4:9

if we are being examined today for a good deed done to a disabled man, as to how he has been healed,

## Acts 4:10

let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified and whom God raised from the dead, this man stands before you healed.

## Acts 4:11

He is

> ‘the stone you builders rejected,
> which has become the chief cornerstone.’

## Acts 4:12

And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among mankind by which we must be saved.”

## Acts 4:13

When they observed the boldness of Peter and John and realised that they were uneducated and ordinary men, they were amazed and recognised them as having been with Jesus.

## Acts 4:14

But seeing the man who had been healed standing with them, they had nothing to say in opposition.

## Acts 4:15

So they ordered them to leave the Council and conferred among themselves,

## Acts 4:16

saying, “What shall we do with these men? For it is evident to all who dwell in Jerusalem that a notable miracle has occurred through them, and we cannot deny it.

## Acts 4:17

But to prevent this from spreading further among the people, let us warn them not to speak any longer to anyone in this name.”

## Acts 4:18

And when they called them back, they commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.

## Acts 4:19

But Peter and John answered them, “Judge for yourselves whether it is right in God’s sight to listen to you rather than to God.

## Acts 4:20

For we cannot stop speaking about what we have seen and heard.”

## Acts 4:21

After further threats, they released them, finding no way to punish them because all the people were glorifying God for what had happened.

## Acts 4:22

For the man who had been healed was over forty years old.

## Acts 4:23

Upon their release, Peter and John returned to their own people and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them.

## Acts 4:24

When they heard this, they raised their voices together to God and said, “Sovereign Lord, you made the heavens and the earth and the sea, and everything in them.

## Acts 4:25

You spoke by the Holy Spirit through the mouth of your servant, our father David:

> ‘Why do the nations rage
> and the peoples plot in vain?

## Acts 4:26

> The kings of the earth rise up and the rulers gather together
> against the Lord and
> against his Anointed One.’

## Acts 4:27

Truly, Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, gathered in this city to act against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed.

## Acts 4:28

They carried out what your power and will had decided beforehand should happen.

## Acts 4:29

And now, Lord, take note of their threats and grant your servants the ability to speak your word with great boldness,

## Acts 4:30

while you stretch out your hand to heal and perform signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus.”

## Acts 4:31

After they prayed, the place where they were gathered was shaken. They were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God boldly.

## Acts 4:32

The congregation of believers were of one heart and soul. No one claimed any of their possessions as their own, but they shared everything they had.

## Acts 4:33

With great power, the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and abundant grace was upon them all.

## Acts 4:34

There were no needy persons among them. From time to time, those who owned land or houses sold them, brought the proceeds

## Acts 4:35

and laid them at the apostles’ feet, and they were distributed to anyone who had need.

## Acts 4:36

Joseph, a Levite from Cyprus, whom the apostles called Barnabas (which means “son of encouragement”), 

## Acts 4:37

sold a field he owned, brought the money, and laid it at the apostles’ feet.
