# Acts Chapter 5

## Acts 5:1

A man named Ananias, along with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property.

## Acts 5:2

With full knowledge of his wife, he kept back part of the proceeds for himself, and brought a portion to lay at the apostles’ feet.

## Acts 5:3

Then Peter said, “Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and keep back part of the money from the land?

## Acts 5:4

Did it not belong to you before it was sold? And after it was sold, was it not at your disposal? Why have you conceived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God.”

## Acts 5:5

Upon hearing these words, Ananias fell down and died; and great fear came upon all who heard of it.

## Acts 5:6

The young men arose, wrapped him up, and carried him out to be buried.

## Acts 5:7

About three hours later, his wife came in, unaware of what had happened.

## Acts 5:8

Peter asked her, “Tell me, is this the price you and Ananias received for the land?” She replied, “Yes, that is the price.”

## Acts 5:9

Peter said to her, “How could you conspire to test the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out also.”

## Acts 5:10

Immediately she fell down at his feet and died. The young men came in, found her dead, and carried her out to bury her beside her husband.

## Acts 5:11

A profound sense of awe came over the whole church and all who heard about these events.

---

## Acts 5:12

Many signs and wonders were performed by the apostles among the people, and all the believers used to meet together in Solomon’s Colonnade.

## Acts 5:13

No one else dared to join them, although the people held them in high esteem.

## Acts 5:14

Nevertheless, more believers were added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and women.

## Acts 5:15

As a result, people brought the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and mats so that at least Peter’s shadow might fall on them as he passed by.

## Acts 5:16

Crowds gathered from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing the sick and those tormented by unclean spirits, and all were healed.

## Acts 5:17

Then the high priest and all his associates, who were members of the Sadducees, were filled with jealousy.

## Acts 5:18

They arrested the apostles and put them in a public prison.

## Acts 5:19

But during the night, an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and led them out.

## Acts 5:20

“Go, stand in the temple courts,” he said, “and share with the people about this new life.”

## Acts 5:21

At daybreak, they entered the temple courts and began to teach. When the high priest and his associates arrived, they called together the Sanhedrin—the full assembly of the elders of Israel—and sent to the prison for the apostles.

## Acts 5:22

But when the officers arrived, they did not find them in the prison, so they returned and reported,

## Acts 5:23

“We found the prison securely locked, with the guards standing at the doors; but when we opened them, we found no one inside.”

## Acts 5:24

When the captain of the temple guard and the chief priests heard this, they were perplexed, wondering what might come of this.

## Acts 5:25

Then someone came and said, “Look! The men you put in prison are standing in the temple courts, teaching the people.”

## Acts 5:26

At that, the captain went with his officers and brought the apostles back without force, for they feared the people might stone them.

## Acts 5:27

The apostles were brought in and presented before the Sanhedrin to be questioned by the high priest.

## Acts 5:28

“We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name,” he said. “Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and intend to bring this man’s blood upon us.”

## Acts 5:29

Peter and the other apostles replied, “We must follow God rather than human beings!

## Acts 5:30

The God of our ancestors raised Jesus from the dead, whom you killed by hanging on a cross.

## Acts 5:31

God exalted him to his own right hand as Prince and Saviour, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.

## Acts 5:32

We testify to these matters, as does the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him.”

---

## Acts 5:33

When they heard this, they were enraged and wanted to put them to death.

## Acts 5:34

But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, respected by all the people, stood up in the Sanhedrin and ordered that the men be put outside for a little while.

## Acts 5:35

Then he addressed the Sanhedrin, “Men of Israel, consider carefully what you intend to do with these men.

## Acts 5:36

Some time ago Theudas appeared, claiming to be someone significant, and about four hundred men rallied to him. He was killed, all his followers were dispersed, and it all came to nothing.

## Acts 5:37

After him, Judas the Galilean appeared in the days of the census and led a band of people in revolt. He too perished, and all his followers were scattered.

## Acts 5:38

Therefore, in the present situation, I advise you: Leave these men alone! Let them go! For if their purpose or activity is of human origin, it will fail.

## Acts 5:39

But if it is from God, you will not be able to stop them; you may even find yourselves fighting against God.”

## Acts 5:40

His speech persuaded them. They called the apostles in, flogged them, and ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and then released them.

## Acts 5:41

The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing that they had been counted worthy to suffer disgrace for the Name.

## Acts 5:42

Day after day, in the temple courts and from house to house, they continued teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Messiah.
