# Acts Chapter 26

## Acts 26:1

Then Agrippa said to Paul, “You are allowed to speak for yourself.” So Paul gestured with his hand and began his defence:

## Acts 26:2

“King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate to make my defence before you today concerning all the charges brought against me by the Jews,

## Acts 26:3

especially since you are well-versed in all Jewish customs and issues. Therefore, I ask you to listen to me patiently.

## Acts 26:4

“All the Jews know about my way of life from my youth, which was spent from the beginning in my own nation and in Jerusalem.

## Acts 26:5

They have known me for a long time, if they are willing to testify, that I lived according to the strictest sect of our religion, as a Pharisee.

## Acts 26:6

And now I am on trial because of my hope in the promise that God made to our ancestors.

## Acts 26:7

This is the promise our twelve tribes hope to attain as they earnestly serve God night and day. It is for this hope, O king, that I am accused by the Jews.

## Acts 26:8

Why should any of you consider it unbelievable that God raises the dead?

## Acts 26:9

“I too was convinced that I should do all I could to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth.

## Acts 26:10

And that is exactly what I did in Jerusalem. With authority from the chief priests, I imprisoned many of the saints, and when they were condemned to death, I cast my vote against them.

## Acts 26:11

I frequently punished them in all the synagogues and tried to force them to blaspheme. In my extreme rage, I pursued them even to foreign cities.

## Acts 26:12

“While engaged in this, I was travelling to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests.

## Acts 26:13

At midday, O king, I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining around me and those travelling with me.

## Acts 26:14

We all fell to the ground, and I heard a voice speaking to me in Hebrew, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to resist the prods.’

## Acts 26:15

I asked, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ And the Lord replied, ‘I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.

## Acts 26:16

But rise and stand on your feet; for I have appeared to you to appoint you as a servant and a witness of what you have seen and what I will show you.

## Acts 26:17

I will deliver you from your own people and from the Gentiles. I am sending you to them

## Acts 26:18

to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those sanctified by faith in me.’

## Acts 26:19

“So then, King Agrippa, I was obedient to the vision from heaven.

## Acts 26:20

First to those in Damascus, then to those in Jerusalem and all Judea, and then to the Gentiles, I preached that they should repent and turn to God, demonstrating their repentance by their deeds.

## Acts 26:21

This is why some Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me.

## Acts 26:22

But God has helped me to this day, and so I stand here testifying to both small and great, saying nothing beyond what the prophets and Moses said would happen—

## Acts 26:23

that the Messiah would suffer and, being the first to rise from the dead, would proclaim light to both his own people and the Gentiles.”

## Acts 26:24

At this point, Festus interrupted Paul’s defence, shouting, “Paul, you are out of your mind! Your great learning is driving you insane.”

## Acts 26:25

But Paul replied, “I am not insane, most excellent Festus, but speak words of truth and reason.

## Acts 26:26

The king is aware of these matters, and I speak to him with confidence, as I am convinced none of this has escaped his notice, since it was not done in a corner.

## Acts 26:27

King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you do.”

## Acts 26:28

Then Agrippa said to Paul, “Do you think that in such a short time you can persuade me to become a Christian?”

## Acts 26:29

Paul replied, “Short time or long, I pray to God that not only you but all who are listening to me today may become what I am, except for these chains.”

## Acts 26:30

The king stood up, along with the governor, Bernice, and those seated with them.

## Acts 26:31

After they left the room, they began discussing among themselves, saying, “This man is not doing anything deserving death or imprisonment.”

## Acts 26:32

Agrippa remarked to Festus, “This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.”
