# Acts Chapter 21

## Acts 21:1

After we had parted from them, we set sail and made a direct course to Cos, and the following day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.

## Acts 21:2

We found a ship going across to Phoenicia, so we went aboard and set sail.

## Acts 21:3

When we came in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on our left, we sailed on to Syria and landed at Tyre, where the ship was to unload its cargo.

## Acts 21:4

We searched for the disciples and stayed there for seven days. Through the Spirit, they kept telling Paul not to go to Jerusalem.

## Acts 21:5

When our time there was ended, we departed and continued our journey, and they all, with their wives and children, escorted us out of the city. On the beach, we knelt down to pray.

## Acts 21:6

After saying farewell to each other, we boarded the ship, and they returned to their homes.

## Acts 21:7

We completed our voyage from Tyre and arrived at Ptolemais, where we greeted the brothers and sisters and stayed with them for a day.

## Acts 21:8

The next day we left and went to Caesarea, where we entered the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the Seven, and stayed with him.

## Acts 21:9

He had four unmarried daughters who prophesied.

## Acts 21:10

While we were staying there for some days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.

## Acts 21:11

He came to us, took Paul’s belt, and bound his own feet and hands, saying, “The Holy Spirit says, ‘In this way the Jews in Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and will deliver him to the Gentiles.’”

## Acts 21:12

When we heard this, we, along with the local residents, pleaded with Paul not to go up to Jerusalem.

## Acts 21:13

Then Paul responded, “Why are you weeping and breaking my heart? I am ready not only to be bound but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.”

## Acts 21:14

Since he would not be persuaded, we ceased and said, “The Lord’s will be done.”

## Acts 21:15

After these days, we prepared and went up to Jerusalem.

## Acts 21:16

Some of the disciples from Caesarea also accompanied us, bringing us to the home of Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we were to stay.

## Acts 21:17

When we arrived in Jerusalem, the brothers and sisters welcomed us warmly.

## Acts 21:18

The next day, Paul went with us to see James, and all the elders were present.

## Acts 21:19

After greeting them, Paul detailed one by one the things God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.

## Acts 21:20

When they heard this, they glorified God and said to him, “You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews have believed, and they are all zealous for the law.

## Acts 21:21

They have been informed that you teach all the Jews among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or follow our customs.

## Acts 21:22

What should be done? They will certainly hear that you have come.

## Acts 21:23

Therefore, do as we advise you: There are four men with us who have taken a vow.

## Acts 21:24

Take them and purify yourself with them, and pay their expenses so they may shave their heads. Thus everyone will know there is no truth in the reports about you, but that you yourself live in observance of the law.

## Acts 21:25

As for the Gentile believers, we have written to them our decision that they should abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from what is strangled, and from sexual immorality.”

## Acts 21:26

The next day, Paul took the men and purified himself along with them. He went to the temple to give notice of the completion of the days of purification, until the offering was made for each of them.

## Acts 21:27

When the seven days were nearly completed, the Jews from Asia saw him in the temple and stirred up the crowd, laying hands on him,

## Acts 21:28

shouting, “Men of Israel, help! This is the man who teaches everyone everywhere against our people, the law, and this place. Moreover, he has brought Greeks into the temple and defiled this holy place.”

## Acts 21:29

(They had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city and assumed Paul had brought him into the temple.)

## Acts 21:30

The whole city was stirred up, and the people rushed together. They seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple, and immediately the gates were shut.

## Acts 21:31

While they were trying to kill him, word reached the commander of the Roman cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion.

## Acts 21:32

He immediately took soldiers and centurions and ran down to the crowd. When they saw the commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.

## Acts 21:33

The commander came up, arrested him, and ordered him to be bound with two chains. He then asked who he was and what he had done.

## Acts 21:34

Some in the crowd shouted one thing and some another. Since the commander could not ascertain the truth because of the uproar, he ordered Paul to be brought into the barracks.

## Acts 21:35

When Paul reached the steps, the violence of the mob was so great that he had to be carried by the soldiers.

## Acts 21:36

The crowd followed, shouting, “Away with him!”

## Acts 21:37

As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he asked the commander, “May I say something to you?” He replied, “Do you speak Greek?

## Acts 21:38

Then you are not the Egyptian who some time ago stirred up a revolt and led four thousand men of the Assassins out into the wilderness?”

## Acts 21:39

Paul said, “I am a Jew from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city. I beg you, let me speak to the people.”

## Acts 21:40

After receiving permission, Paul stood on the steps and motioned to the people with his hand. When there was a great silence, he spoke to them in the Hebrew dialect, saying,
