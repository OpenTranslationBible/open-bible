# Acts Chapter 19

## Acts 19:1

While Apollos was in Corinth, Paul journeyed through the inland regions and arrived at Ephesus. There he encountered some disciples.

## Acts 19:2

He inquired of them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?” They replied, “We have not even heard whether there is a Holy Spirit.”

## Acts 19:3

Paul then asked, “Into what then were you baptised?” They answered, “Into John’s baptism.”

## Acts 19:4

Paul explained, “John performed a baptism of repentance, instructing the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, in Jesus.”

## Acts 19:5

Upon hearing this, they were baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus.

## Acts 19:6

When Paul laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they began to speak in tongues and to prophesy.

## Acts 19:7

There were about twelve men in total.

## Acts 19:8

Paul entered the synagogue and spoke boldly for three months, engaging in discussions and persuading them concerning the kingdom of God.

## Acts 19:9

However, when some became stubborn and refused to believe, speaking ill of the Way before the assembly, he departed from them and took the disciples with him, conducting daily discussions in the lecture hall of Tyrannus.

## Acts 19:10

This continued for two years, so that all the inhabitants of Asia, both Jews and Greeks, heard the word of the Lord.

---

## Acts 19:11

God performed extraordinary miracles through Paul,

## Acts 19:12

so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched his skin were brought to the sick, and their diseases left them and the evil spirits departed.

---

## Acts 19:13

Some itinerant Jewish exorcists attempted to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those possessed by evil spirits, saying, “I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul preaches.”

## Acts 19:14

There were seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, doing this.

## Acts 19:15

But the evil spirit responded, “Jesus I know, and Paul I am acquainted with, but who are you?”

## Acts 19:16

Then the man with the evil spirit leapt on them, overpowered them all, and assaulted them, so they fled from the house naked and wounded.

## Acts 19:17

This incident became known to all the residents of Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks, and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was held in high esteem.

## Acts 19:18

Many believers came forward, confessing and disclosing their practices.

## Acts 19:19

A considerable number who practised sorcery brought their books together and burned them in public view; when they calculated the value of the books, it totalled fifty thousand pieces of silver.

## Acts 19:20

Thus, the word of the Lord continued to grow and prevail mightily.

---

## Acts 19:21

After these events, Paul resolved in the Spirit to travel to Jerusalem, passing through Macedonia and Achaia, saying, “After I have been there, I must also visit Rome.”

## Acts 19:22

He sent two of his assistants, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he remained in Asia for a time.

---

## Acts 19:23

Around that period, a significant disturbance arose concerning the Way.

## Acts 19:24

A silversmith named Demetrius, who crafted silver shrines of Artemis, generated substantial business for the craftsmen.

## Acts 19:25

He gathered them, along with the workers in related trades, and said, “Men, you know that our prosperity derives from this business.

## Acts 19:26

And you observe and hear that not only in Ephesus but in nearly all of Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away a large number of people, asserting that gods made by human hands are not gods at all.

## Acts 19:27

There is a danger not only that our trade will lose its good name, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be discredited, and she, whom all Asia and the world worship, will be deprived of her majesty.”

---

## Acts 19:28

When they heard this, they were filled with rage and began shouting, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”

## Acts 19:29

The whole city was thrown into confusion, and they rushed together into the theatre, dragging along Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul’s travelling companions from Macedonia.

## Acts 19:30

Paul wanted to go into the assembly, but the disciples would not allow him.

## Acts 19:31

Even some of the Asiarchs, who were friends of Paul, sent word to him, urging him not to venture into the theatre.

## Acts 19:32

The assembly was in chaos: some were shouting one thing, some another, and most of them did not know why they had gathered.

## Acts 19:33

The Jews in the crowd pushed Alexander forward, and he motioned for silence, intending to make a defence before the people.

## Acts 19:34

But when they recognised that he was a Jew, they all shouted in unison for about two hours, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”

---

## Acts 19:35

The city clerk quieted the crowd and said, “Men of Ephesus, who does not know that the city of Ephesus is the guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of her image which fell from heaven?

## Acts 19:36

Since these facts are undeniable, you ought to remain calm and not act rashly.

## Acts 19:37

You have brought these men here, though they have neither desecrated temples nor spoken against our goddess.

## Acts 19:38

If Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen have a grievance against anyone, the courts are open and there are proconsuls; let them bring charges against one another.

## Acts 19:39

If there is anything further you wish to address, it must be settled in a lawful assembly.

## Acts 19:40

For we are in danger of being charged with rioting because of today’s events, as there is no justification for this commotion, and we would be unable to account for this disorderly gathering.”

## Acts 19:41

Having spoken in this manner, he brought the assembly to a close.
