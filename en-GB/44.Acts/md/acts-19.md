# Acts Chapter 19

## Acts 19:1

Now it happened that while Apollos was in Corinth,  
Paul passed through the upper country and came to Ephesus, and found some disciples.

## Acts 19:2

He said to them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?”  
And they said to him, “On the contrary, we have not even heard if there is a Holy Spirit.”

## Acts 19:3

And he said, “Into what then were you baptised?”  
They said, “Into John’s baptism.”

## Acts 19:4

Paul said,  
“John baptised with a baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in Him who was coming after him, that is, in Jesus.”

## Acts 19:5

When they heard this, they were baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus.

## Acts 19:6

And when Paul had laid hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them,  
and they began speaking with tongues and prophesying.

## Acts 19:7

There were about twelve men in all.

---

## Acts 19:8

And he entered the synagogue and continued speaking out boldly for three months,  
having discussions and persuading them about the kingdom of God.

## Acts 19:9

But when some were becoming hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the people,  
he withdrew from them and took the disciples away with him,  
and held daily discussions in the lecture hall of Tyrannus.

## Acts 19:10

This took place for two years, so that all who lived in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.

---

## Acts 19:11

God was performing extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul,

## Acts 19:12

so that even facecloths or aprons that had touched his skin were brought to the sick,  
and the diseases left them and the evil spirits went out.

---

## Acts 19:13

But also some of the Jewish exorcists, who went from place to place,  
attempted to use the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying,  
“I order you in the name of Jesus whom Paul preaches!”

## Acts 19:14

Now there were seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, doing this.

## Acts 19:15

But the evil spirit responded and said to them,  
“I recognise Jesus, and I know of Paul, but who are you?”

## Acts 19:16

And the man in whom was the evil spirit pounced on them and subdued all of them and overpowered them,  
so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.

## Acts 19:17

This became known to all who lived in Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks;  
and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was being magnified.

## Acts 19:18

Also many of those who had believed kept coming, confessing and disclosing their practices.

## Acts 19:19

And many of those who practiced magic brought their books together and began burning them in the sight of everyone;  
and they added up the prices of the books, and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver.

## Acts 19:20

So the word of the Lord was growing and prevailing mightily.

---

## Acts 19:21

Now after these things were finished, Paul resolved in the Spirit to go to Jerusalem  
after he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, saying,  
“After I have been there, I must also see Rome.”

## Acts 19:22

And after he sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia,  
he himself stayed in Asia for a while.

---

## Acts 19:23

About that time a major disturbance occurred in regard to the Way.

## Acts 19:24

For a man named Demetrius, a silversmith who made silver shrines of Artemis,  
was bringing considerable business to the craftsmen;

## Acts 19:25

he gathered these men together with the workmen of similar trades and said,  
“Men, you know that our prosperity depends upon this business.

## Acts 19:26

You see and hear that not only in Ephesus, but in almost all of Asia,  
this Paul has persuaded and turned away a considerable number of people,  
saying that gods made by hands are not gods at all.

## Acts 19:27

Not only is there danger that this trade of ours will fall into disrepute,  
but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be regarded as worthless,  
and that she whom all of Asia and the world worship will even be dethroned from her magnificence.”

---

## Acts 19:28

When they heard this and were filled with rage, they began shouting,  
“Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”

## Acts 19:29

The city was filled with the confusion,  
and they rushed with one accord into the theatre, dragging along Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul’s travelling companions from Macedonia.

## Acts 19:30

And when Paul wanted to go into the assembly, the disciples would not let him.

## Acts 19:31

Also some of the Asiarchs who were friends of his sent word to him and repeatedly urged him  
not to venture into the theatre.

## Acts 19:32

So then, some were shouting one thing and some another, for the assembly was in confusion,  
and the majority did not know for what reason they had come together.

## Acts 19:33

Some of the crowd prompted Alexander, since the Jews had put him forward;  
and Alexander, motioning with his hand, wanted to make a defence to the assembly.

## Acts 19:34

But when they recognised that he was a Jew, a single outcry arose from them all as they shouted for about two hours,  
“Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”

---

## Acts 19:35

After quieting the crowd, the town clerk said,  
“Men of Ephesus, what person is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians  
is guardian of the temple of the great Artemis, and of the image which fell down from heaven?

## Acts 19:36

So, since these things are undeniable, you ought to keep calm and do nothing rash.

## Acts 19:37

For you have brought these men here who are neither temple robbers nor blasphemers of our goddess.

## Acts 19:38

So then, if Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a complaint against anyone,  
the courts are in session and proconsuls are available; have them bring charges against one another.

## Acts 19:39

But if you want anything beyond this, it shall be settled in the lawful assembly.

## Acts 19:40

For indeed, we are in danger of being accused of a riot in connection with today’s events,  
since there is no real cause for it, and in this connection we will be unable to account for this disorderly gathering.”

## Acts 19:41

After saying this, he dismissed the assembly.
