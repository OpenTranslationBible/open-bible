# Acts Chapter 24

## Acts 24:1

After five days, the high priest Ananias went down to Caesarea with some elders and a lawyer named Tertullus, and they presented their charges against Paul to the governor.

## Acts 24:2

When Paul was summoned, Tertullus began his accusation, saying to the governor, “We have enjoyed great peace under you, and your foresight has brought about reforms for this nation.

## Acts 24:3

In every way and everywhere, most excellent Felix, we acknowledge this with all gratitude.

## Acts 24:4

But, so as not to weary you further, I request that you hear us briefly, by your kindness.

## Acts 24:5

We have found this man to be a public menace, stirring up dissensions among the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the Nazarene sect.

## Acts 24:6

He even attempted to desecrate the temple, so we seized him.

## Acts 24:7

[and we would have judged him according to our law]

## Acts 24:8

By examining him yourself, you will be able to ascertain the truth about all these charges we are bringing against him.”

## Acts 24:9

The other Jews joined in the accusation, affirming that these things were so.

## Acts 24:10

When the governor nodded for him to speak, Paul replied: “I know that for many years you have been a judge over this nation; therefore, I gladly make my defence.

## Acts 24:11

You can verify that it was no more than twelve days ago that I went up to Jerusalem to worship.

## Acts 24:12

They did not find me arguing with anyone at the temple, or stirring up a crowd in the synagogues or anywhere else in the city.

## Acts 24:13

Nor can they prove to you the charges they are now making against me.

## Acts 24:14

However, I confess that I worship the God of our ancestors in accordance with the Way, which they call a sect. I believe everything that is in accordance with the Law and written in the Prophets,

## Acts 24:15

and I have the same hope in God as these men themselves have, that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked.

## Acts 24:16

In view of this, I strive always to maintain a clear conscience before God and man.

## Acts 24:17

After several years, I came to bring charitable gifts to my nation and to present offerings.

## Acts 24:18

I was ceremonially clean when they found me in the temple courts doing this, without any crowd or disturbance. But there were some Jews from Asia—

## Acts 24:19

who ought to be here before you and bring charges if they have anything against me.

## Acts 24:20

Or let these men here state what crime they found in me when I stood before the Council—

## Acts 24:21

unless it was this one statement I shouted while standing among them: ‘It is concerning the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you today.’”

## Acts 24:22

Then Felix, who had a rather accurate knowledge of the Way, adjourned the proceedings. “When Lysias the commander comes,” he said, “I will decide your case.”

## Acts 24:23

He ordered the centurion to keep Paul in custody but to allow him some freedom and not to prevent any of his friends from attending to his needs.

## Acts 24:24

Some days later, Felix arrived with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish. He sent for Paul and listened to him speak about faith in Christ Jesus.

## Acts 24:25

As Paul discussed righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix became frightened and said, “That is enough for now! You may leave. When I find it convenient, I will summon you.”

## Acts 24:26

At the same time, he was hoping that Paul would offer him money, so he sent for him frequently and talked with him.

## Acts 24:27

After two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, but because Felix wanted to grant a favour to the Jews, he left Paul imprisoned.
