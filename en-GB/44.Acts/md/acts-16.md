# Acts Chapter 16

## Acts 16:1

Paul travelled to Derbe and then to Lystra, where there was a disciple named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, but his father was Greek.

## Acts 16:2

The brothers and sisters in Lystra and Iconium spoke well of him.

## Acts 16:3

Paul desired to have him accompany them on the journey, so he circumcised him because of the Jews in those regions, for they all knew that his father was Greek.

## Acts 16:4

As they journeyed through the cities, they delivered the decrees decided by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem for the people to observe.

## Acts 16:5

Thus the churches were strengthened in faith and increased in number daily.

---

## Acts 16:6

Paul and his companions travelled throughout the Phrygian and Galatian region, having been prevented by the Holy Spirit from speaking the word in Asia.

## Acts 16:7

When they reached the border of Mysia, they attempted to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them.

## Acts 16:8

So, bypassing Mysia, they went down to Troas.

## Acts 16:9

During the night, Paul had a vision of a man from Macedonia standing and pleading with him, saying, “Come over to Macedonia and help us.”

## Acts 16:10

After seeing the vision, we immediately made efforts to go to Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to proclaim the gospel to them.

---

## Acts 16:11

Setting sail from Troas, we made a direct course to Samothrace, and the following day to Neapolis.

## Acts 16:12

From there, we travelled to Philippi, a leading city of the district of Macedonia and a Roman colony; we stayed in this city for several days.

## Acts 16:13

On the Sabbath, we went outside the city gate to the riverside, where we expected to find a place of prayer; we sat down and began to speak to the women who had gathered there.

## Acts 16:14

A woman named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth from the city of Thyatira and a worshiper of God, was listening. The Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul's message.

## Acts 16:15

When she and her household were baptised, she urged us, saying, “If you consider me faithful to the Lord, come and stay at my house.” She persuaded us.

---

## Acts 16:16

As we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a female slave who had a spirit of divination, bringing much profit to her owners through fortune-telling.

## Acts 16:17

She followed Paul and us, crying out, “These men are servants of the Most High God, who are proclaiming to you the way of salvation.”

## Acts 16:18

She continued doing this for many days. Paul, greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, “I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!” And it left her at that moment.

---

## Acts 16:19

When her owners saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the authorities.

## Acts 16:20

They brought them to the magistrates and said, “These men are Jews and are causing trouble in our city,

## Acts 16:21

advocating customs unlawful for us Romans to accept or practise.”

## Acts 16:22

The crowd joined in the attack against them, and the magistrates tore off their garments and ordered them to be beaten with rods.

## Acts 16:23

After inflicting many blows upon them, they threw them into prison, commanding the jailer to guard them securely.

## Acts 16:24

Upon receiving such orders, he put them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks.

---

## Acts 16:25

About midnight, Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them.

## Acts 16:26

Suddenly, there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone's chains were unfastened.

## Acts 16:27

When the jailer awoke and saw the prison doors open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, thinking the prisoners had escaped.

## Acts 16:28

But Paul called out in a loud voice, “Do not harm yourself, for we are all here!”

---

## Acts 16:29

The jailer called for lights, rushed in, and trembling with fear, fell before Paul and Silas.

## Acts 16:30

He then brought them out and asked, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”

## Acts 16:31

They replied, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.”

## Acts 16:32

They spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house.

## Acts 16:33

At that hour of the night, he took them and washed their wounds; then immediately he and all his household were baptised.

## Acts 16:34

He brought them into his house, set food before them, and was filled with joy because he had come to believe in God—he and his whole household.

---

## Acts 16:35

When daylight came, the magistrates sent their officers with the order: “Release those men.”

## Acts 16:36

The jailer reported this to Paul, saying, “The magistrates have sent word that you may be released. Now therefore, come out and go in peace.”

## Acts 16:37

But Paul said to the officers, “They have beaten us publicly without a trial, men who are Roman citizens, and have thrown us into prison. Now, do they want to release us secretly? No indeed! Let them come themselves and escort us out.”

## Acts 16:38

The officers reported these words to the magistrates, and they were alarmed when they heard that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens.

## Acts 16:39

They came to appease them and escorted them from the prison, requesting them to leave the city.

## Acts 16:40

After leaving the prison, they went to Lydia’s house, where they met with the brothers and sisters and encouraged them. Then they departed.
