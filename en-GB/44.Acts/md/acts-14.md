# Acts Chapter 14

## Acts 14:1

In Iconium, Paul and Barnabas entered the Jewish synagogue together, and spoke in such a manner that a large number of both Jews and Greeks came to believe.

## Acts 14:2

However, the Jews who were not persuaded stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers.

## Acts 14:3

Consequently, Paul and Barnabas spent a significant amount of time there, speaking boldly with reliance on the Lord, who confirmed the message of his grace by allowing signs and wonders to be performed through them.

## Acts 14:4

The people of the city were divided; some sided with the Jews, while others sided with the apostles.

## Acts 14:5

When a plot was formed by both the Gentiles and Jews, along with their leaders, to mistreat and stone them,

## Acts 14:6

they learned of it and escaped to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra, and Derbe, and the surrounding region.

## Acts 14:7

There, they continued to proclaim the gospel.

## Acts 14:8

In Lystra, there was a man sitting who was lame. He had been disabled from birth and had never walked.

## Acts 14:9

This man listened to Paul as he spoke. Paul looked intently at him and saw that he had faith to be healed,

## Acts 14:10

and called out in a loud voice, “Stand upright on your feet!” At that, the man leapt up and began to walk.

## Acts 14:11

When the crowd saw what Paul had done, they raised their voices, saying in the Lycaonian language, “The gods have come down to us in human form!”

## Acts 14:12

They began calling Barnabas, Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, since he was the chief speaker.

## Acts 14:13

The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city, brought bulls and garlands to the gates, intending to offer sacrifices with the crowd.

## Acts 14:14

Upon hearing this, the apostles Barnabas and Paul tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd, shouting,

## Acts 14:15

“Men, why are you doing these things? We are also men, of the same nature as you, bringing you good news, that you should turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and everything in them.

## Acts 14:16

In past generations, he allowed all nations to go their own ways.

## Acts 14:17

Yet he did not leave himself without witness, in that he did good and gave you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness.”

## Acts 14:18

Even with these words, they had difficulty restraining the crowd from offering sacrifices to them.

## Acts 14:19

Then some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and having persuaded the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, thinking he was dead.

## Acts 14:20

But while the disciples gathered around him, he got up and went back into the city. The next day, he departed with Barnabas for Derbe.

## Acts 14:21

After they had preached the gospel in that city and gained a considerable number of disciples, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,

## Acts 14:22

strengthening the disciples and encouraging them to remain steadfast in the faith, saying, “We must endure many hardships to enter the kingdom of God.”

## Acts 14:23

Paul and Barnabas appointed elders for them in each church, and with prayer and fasting, they committed them to the Lord in whom they had believed.

## Acts 14:24

They traveled through Pisidia and came into Pamphylia.

## Acts 14:25

After proclaiming the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.

## Acts 14:26

From there, they returned by sea to Antioch, where they had been entrusted to the grace of God for the work they had completed.

## Acts 14:27

Upon their arrival, they gathered the church together and reported all that God had done through them and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.

## Acts 14:28

And they spent a considerable time there with the disciples.
