# Acts Chapter 14

## Acts 14:1

In Iconium they entered the synagogue of the Jews together,  
and spoke in such a way that a large number of people believed, both Jews and Greeks.

## Acts 14:2

But the Jews who refused to believe stirred up the minds of the Gentiles and embittered them against the brothers.

## Acts 14:3

Therefore they spent a long time there, speaking boldly with reliance upon the Lord,  
who was testifying to the word of His grace, granting that signs and wonders be performed by their hands.

## Acts 14:4

But the people of the city were divided;  
some sided with the Jews, and others with the apostles.

## Acts 14:5

And when an attempt was made by both the Gentiles and the Jews,  
together with their rulers, to treat them abusively and to stone them,

## Acts 14:6

they became aware of it and fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the surrounding region;

## Acts 14:7

and there they continued to preach the gospel.

## Acts 14:8

In Lystra a man was sitting whose feet were useless,  
having been disabled from his mother’s womb, who had never walked.

## Acts 14:9

This man was listening to Paul as he spoke,  
who, when he had fixed his gaze on him and saw that he had faith to be made well,

## Acts 14:10

said with a loud voice,  
“Stand upright on your feet!”  
And he leapt up and began to walk.

## Acts 14:11

When the crowds saw what Paul had done, they raised their voices, saying in the Lycaonian language,  
“The gods have become like men and have come down to us!”

## Acts 14:12

And they began calling Barnabas, Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, since he was the chief speaker.

## Acts 14:13

Moreover, the priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the city,  
brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and wanted to offer sacrifice with the crowds.

---

## Acts 14:14

But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard about it, they tore their robes  
and rushed out into the crowd, crying out

## Acts 14:15

and saying,  
“Men, why are you doing these things? We are also men, of the same nature as you,  
preaching the gospel to you to turn from these useless things to a living God,  
who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and everything that is in them.

## Acts 14:16

In past generations He permitted all the nations to go their own ways;

## Acts 14:17

yet He did not leave Himself without witness,  
in that He did good and gave you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons,  
satisfying your hearts with food and gladness.”

## Acts 14:18

And even by saying these things, only with difficulty did they restrain the crowds from offering sacrifices to them.

---

## Acts 14:19

But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and after winning over the crowds,  
they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, thinking that he was dead.

## Acts 14:20

But while the disciples stood around him, he got up and entered the city.  
The next day he left with Barnabas for Derbe.

---

## Acts 14:21

And after they had preached the gospel to that city and had made a good number of disciples,  
they returned to Lystra, to Iconium, and to Antioch,

## Acts 14:22

strengthening the souls of the disciples,  
encouraging them to continue in the faith,  
and saying, “It is through many tribulations that we must enter the kingdom of God.”

## Acts 14:23

When they had appointed elders for them in every church,  
having prayed with fasting, they entrusted them to the Lord in whom they had believed.

---

## Acts 14:24

They passed through Pisidia and came into Pamphylia.

## Acts 14:25

When they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.

## Acts 14:26

From there they sailed to Antioch, from where they had been entrusted to the grace of God  
for the work that they had accomplished.

## Acts 14:27

When they had arrived and gathered the church together,  
they began to report all the things that God had done with them,  
and how He had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.

## Acts 14:28

And they spent a long time with the disciples.
