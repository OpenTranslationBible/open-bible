except that the Holy Spirit warns me in every city that imprisonment and hardships await me.

However, I consider my life worth nothing to me; my only aim is to finish the race and complete the ministry I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of God’s grace.

## Acts 20:25

“Now I know that none of you among whom I have preached the kingdom will see my face again.

Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Shepherd the church of God, which He purchased with His own blood.

You yourselves know that these hands have supplied my own needs and the needs of my companions.

In everything I did, I showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help the weak, remembering the words of the Lord Jesus, who said, ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’”
