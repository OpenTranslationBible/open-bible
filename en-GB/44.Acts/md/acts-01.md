# Acts Chapter 1

## Acts 1:1

In my previous account, Theophilus, I documented all that Jesus began to do and teach,

## Acts 1:2

up to the day he was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen.

## Acts 1:3

After his suffering, he presented himself alive to them with many convincing proofs, appearing over a period of forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God.

## Acts 1:4

On one occasion, while gathering them together, he instructed them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, “which,” he said, “you have heard me speak about;

## Acts 1:5

for John baptised with water, but you will be baptised with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.”

## Acts 1:6

So when they were assembled, they asked him, “Lord, is this the time you are going to restore the kingdom to Israel?”

## Acts 1:7

He replied, “It is not for you to know the times or dates the Father has set by his own authority.

## Acts 1:8

But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”

## Acts 1:9

After he said this, he was lifted up while they were watching, and a cloud hid him from their sight.

## Acts 1:10

As they were gazing intently into the sky while he was going, suddenly two men in white clothing stood beside them.

## Acts 1:11

“Men of Galilee,” they said, “why do you stand looking into the sky? This same Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will return in the same way you have seen him go into heaven.”

## Acts 1:12

Then they returned to Jerusalem from the hill called the Mount of Olives, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day’s journey away.

## Acts 1:13

When they arrived, they went upstairs to the room where they were staying. Those present were Peter, John, James and Andrew; Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew; James son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James.

## Acts 1:14

All these were constantly devoting themselves to prayer, along with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.

## Acts 1:15

In those days Peter stood up among the believers (a group numbering about 120 people) and said,

## Acts 1:16

“Brothers and sisters, the Scripture had to be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit spoke long ago through David concerning Judas, who served as a guide for those who arrested Jesus.

## Acts 1:17

He was counted among us and shared in this ministry.”

## Acts 1:18

(Now this man acquired a field with the payment he received for his wickedness, and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his intestines spilled out.

## Acts 1:19

This became known to all the residents of Jerusalem, so they called that field in their own language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)

## Acts 1:20

“For,” said Peter, “it is written in the book of Psalms:

> ‘May his place be deserted;
> let there be no one to dwell in it,’

and,

> ‘May another take his office.’

## Acts 1:21

Therefore it is necessary to choose one of the men who have been with us the whole time the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,

## Acts 1:22

beginning from John’s baptism to the day he was taken up from us. For one of these must become a witness with us of his resurrection.”

## Acts 1:23

So they proposed two men: Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus) and Matthias.

## Acts 1:24

Then they prayed, “Lord, you know everyone’s heart. Show us which of these two you have chosen

## Acts 1:25

to take over this ministry and apostleship, which Judas left to go to his own place.”

## Acts 1:26

Then they cast lots, and Matthias was chosen; thus he was added to the eleven apostles.
