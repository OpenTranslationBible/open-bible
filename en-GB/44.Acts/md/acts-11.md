# Acts Chapter 11

## Acts 11:1

The apostles and the brothers and sisters throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.

## Acts 11:2

When Peter went up to Jerusalem, the Jewish believers took issue with him,

## Acts 11:3

saying, “You went into the house of uncircumcised men and ate with them.”

## Acts 11:4

Peter began and explained everything to them in an orderly manner:

## Acts 11:5

“I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision: something like a large sheet being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to where I was.

## Acts 11:6

I looked into it and saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, reptiles, and birds of the air.

## Acts 11:7

Then I heard a voice telling me, ‘Get up, Peter; kill and eat.’

## Acts 11:8

But I said, ‘Certainly not, Lord! Nothing impure or unclean has ever entered my mouth.’

## Acts 11:9

The voice spoke from heaven a second time, ‘Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.’

## Acts 11:10

This happened three times, and then it was all pulled up to heaven again.

## Acts 11:11

Right then, three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea arrived at the house where we were staying.

## Acts 11:12

The Spirit told me to go with them without hesitation. These six brothers also went with me, and we entered the man’s house.

## Acts 11:13

He told us how he had seen an angel in his house, saying, ‘Send to Joppa for Simon, who is called Peter.

## Acts 11:14

He will bring you a message through which you and all your household will be saved.’

## Acts 11:15

As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit came upon them just as He had come upon us at the beginning.

## Acts 11:16

Then I remembered what the Lord had said: ‘John baptised with water, but you will be baptised with the Holy Spirit.’

## Acts 11:17

So if God gave them the same gift He gave us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to think that I could oppose God?”

## Acts 11:18

When they heard this, they quieted down and glorified God, saying, “So then, God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance that leads to life.”

## Acts 11:19

Those who had been scattered by the persecution that arose in connection with Stephen travelled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, spreading the word only among Jews.

## Acts 11:20

But some of them, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, went to Antioch and began to speak to Greeks also, proclaiming the good news about the Lord Jesus.

## Acts 11:21

The hand of the Lord was with them, and a large number of people believed and turned to the Lord.

## Acts 11:22

News of this reached the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.

## Acts 11:23

When he arrived and saw the grace of God, he was glad and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with all their hearts.

## Acts 11:24

He was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith, and a considerable number of people were added to the Lord.

## Acts 11:25

Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul,

## Acts 11:26

and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year Barnabas and Saul met with the church and taught a large number of people. The disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.

## Acts 11:27

During this time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.

## Acts 11:28

One of them, named Agabus, stood up and through the Spirit predicted that a severe famine would spread over the entire Roman world. This occurred during the reign of Claudius.

## Acts 11:29

The disciples, each according to their ability, decided to provide help for the brothers and sisters living in Judea.

## Acts 11:30

This they did, sending their gift to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.
