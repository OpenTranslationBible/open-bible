# Acts Chapter 9

## Acts 9:1

Saul, still uttering threats and murder against the Lord’s disciples, went to the high priest,

## Acts 9:2

and requested letters to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.

## Acts 9:3

As he travelled and approached Damascus, suddenly a light from heaven shone around him.

## Acts 9:4

He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?”

## Acts 9:5

He asked, “Who are you, Lord?” The reply came, “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.

## Acts 9:6

Now get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.”

## Acts 9:7

The men travelling with Saul stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one.

## Acts 9:8

Saul got up from the ground, but though his eyes were open, he could see nothing. So they led him by the hand into Damascus.

## Acts 9:9

For three days he was without sight, and neither ate nor drank.

---

## Acts 9:10

In Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias. The Lord spoke to him in a vision, “Ananias.” He answered, “Here I am, Lord.”

## Acts 9:11

The Lord instructed him, “Go to the street called Straight, and inquire at the house of Judas for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying.

## Acts 9:12

He has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and lay hands on him to restore his sight.”

## Acts 9:13

Ananias replied, “Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much harm he has done to your saints in Jerusalem.

## Acts 9:14

And he has come here with the authority from the chief priests to capture all who call upon your name.”

## Acts 9:15

But the Lord said to him, “Go, for he is a chosen instrument of mine to bring my name to the Gentiles, to kings, and to the people of Israel;

## Acts 9:16

I will show him how much he must suffer for my name.”

---

## Acts 9:17

So Ananias went and entered the house, and laying his hands on him said, “Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road you were travelling, has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.”

## Acts 9:18

Immediately, something like scales fell from his eyes, and he regained his sight. He got up and was baptised,

## Acts 9:19

and after taking food, he was strengthened. Saul spent several days with the disciples in Damascus.

## Acts 9:20

Without delay, he began to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues, declaring, “He is the Son of God.”

---

## Acts 9:21

All who heard him were amazed and said, “Is this not the man who caused havoc in Jerusalem among those who called on this name, and has come here to take them bound to the chief priests?”

## Acts 9:22

But Saul grew more powerful and confounded the Jews living in Damascus by proving that Jesus is the Messiah.

---

## Acts 9:23

After many days had passed, the Jews plotted to kill him,

## Acts 9:24

but their plot became known to Saul. They were watching the city gates day and night to kill him.

## Acts 9:25

But his disciples took him by night and let him down through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a basket.

---

## Acts 9:26

When he arrived in Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, not believing he was a disciple.

## Acts 9:27

But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. He recounted to them how Saul had seen the Lord on the road, and that He had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly in Damascus in the name of Jesus.

## Acts 9:28

So Saul stayed with them, moving about freely in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord.

## Acts 9:29

He conversed and debated with the Hellenistic Jews, but they sought to kill him.

## Acts 9:30

When the believers learned of this, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him to Tarsus.

---

## Acts 9:31

Then the church throughout Judea, Galilee, and Samaria enjoyed a time of peace and was strengthened. Living in reverence for the Lord and encouraged by the Holy Spirit, it grew in numbers.

---

## Acts 9:32

As Peter travelled throughout the region, he came down to visit the saints who lived in Lydda.

## Acts 9:33

There he found a man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years, as he was paralysed.

## Acts 9:34

“Aeneas,” Peter said to him, “Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and make your bed.” Immediately he got up.

## Acts 9:35

All those who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord.

---

## Acts 9:36

In Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha (which in Greek is Dorcas); she was always doing good and helping the poor.

## Acts 9:37

Around that time she became ill and died, and her body was washed and placed in an upstairs room.

## Acts 9:38

Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, having heard that Peter was there, sent two men to him, urging him, “Please come at once.”

## Acts 9:39

Peter went with them, and when he arrived, he was taken upstairs to the room. All the widows stood around him, weeping and showing him the robes and garments Dorcas had made while she was with them.

## Acts 9:40

Peter sent them all out of the room, then knelt down and prayed. Turning to the body, he said, “Tabitha, arise.” She opened her eyes, and seeing Peter, she sat up.

## Acts 9:41

He took her by the hand and helped her to her feet. Then he called the saints and widows and presented her alive.

## Acts 9:42

This became known throughout Joppa, and many came to believe in the Lord.

## Acts 9:43

Peter stayed in Joppa for many days with a tanner named Simon.
