# Acts Chapter 2

## Acts 2:1

When the day of Pentecost arrived, they were all gathered together in one place.

## Acts 2:2

Suddenly, a sound like a strong rushing wind came from heaven and filled the entire house where they were sitting.

## Acts 2:3

They saw what appeared to be tongues of fire that separated and settled on each of them.

## Acts 2:4

They were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in different languages, as the Spirit gave them the ability to do so.

---

## Acts 2:5

Now there were devout Jews from every nation under heaven residing in Jerusalem.

## Acts 2:6

When they heard this sound, a crowd gathered in bewilderment, because each one heard them speaking in their own language.

## Acts 2:7

They were utterly amazed and asked, “Aren’t all these who are speaking Galileans?

## Acts 2:8

How is it that each of us hears them in our native language?

## Acts 2:9

People from Parthia, Media, and Elam; those living in Mesopotamia, Judea, and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,

## Acts 2:10

Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene; visitors from Rome, both Jews and converts to Judaism;

## Acts 2:11

Cretans and Arabs—we hear them declaring the mighty works of God in our own tongues!”

## Acts 2:12

In amazement and confusion, they asked one another, “What could this mean?”

## Acts 2:13

But others ridiculed them and said, “They have had too much new wine.”

---

## Acts 2:14

Then Peter stood with the Eleven, raised his voice, and addressed the crowd: “Men of Judea and all who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen carefully to my words.

## Acts 2:15

These people are not drunk, as you suppose, for it is only the third hour of the day.

## Acts 2:16

No, this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:

## Acts 2:17

> ‘In the last days,’ says God,
> ‘I will pour out my Spirit on all people;
> your sons and daughters will prophesy,
> your young men will see visions, a
> nd your old men will dream dreams.

## Acts 2:18

> Even on my servants, both men and women,
> I will pour out my Spirit in those days,
> and they will prophesy.

## Acts 2:19

> I will show wonders in the heavens above
> and signs on the earth below,
> blood and fire and clouds of smoke.

## Acts 2:20

> The sun will be turned to darkness
> and the moon to blood
> before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord.

## Acts 2:21

> And everyone who calls on the name of the Lord
> will be saved.’

## Acts 2:22

“Men of Israel, listen to this: Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you by miracles, wonders, and signs, which God performed among you through him, as you yourselves know.

## Acts 2:23

This man was handed over to you by God’s deliberate plan and foreknowledge; and you, with the help of lawless men, put him to death by nailing him to the cross.

## Acts 2:24

Yet God raised him from the dead, releasing him from the agony of death, because it was impossible for death to maintain its hold on him.

## Acts 2:25

David said about him:

> ‘I saw the Lord always before me.
> Because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.

## Acts 2:26

> Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices;
> my body also will rest in hope,

## Acts 2:27

> because you will not abandon me to the realm of the dead,
> nor will you let your Holy One see decay.

## Acts 2:28

> You have made known to me the paths of life;
> you will fill me with joy in your presence.’

---

## Acts 2:29

“Brothers, I can confidently tell you that the patriarch David died and was buried, and his tomb is here to this day.

## Acts 2:30

But he was a prophet and understood that God had sworn to him with an oath to place one of his descendants on his throne.

## Acts 2:31

Foreseeing this, he spoke of the Messiah's resurrection, that he was not abandoned to the realm of the dead, nor did his body see decay.

## Acts 2:32

God has brought this Jesus back to life, and we are all witnesses of this fact.

## Acts 2:33

Exalted to the right hand of God, he has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out what you now observe and hear.

## Acts 2:34

For David did not ascend to heaven, and yet he said,

> ‘The Lord said to my Lord:
> “Sit at my right hand

## Acts 2:35

> until I make your enemies
> a footstool for your feet.”’

## Acts 2:36

“Therefore let all the house of Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah.”

---

## Acts 2:37

When the people heard this, they were deeply moved and said to Peter and the other apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?”

## Acts 2:38

Peter replied, “Turn back and be baptised, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.

## Acts 2:39

This promise is for you and your children and for all who are distant—for all whom the Lord our God will call.”

## Acts 2:40

With many other words he warned them; and he urged them, “Save yourselves from this corrupt generation.”

## Acts 2:41

Those who embraced his message were baptised, and about three thousand were added to their number that day.

---

## Acts 2:42

They committed themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.

## Acts 2:43

Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs done by the apostles.

## Acts 2:44

All the believers were together and shared everything in common.

## Acts 2:45

They sold their property and possessions to provide for anyone who was in need.

## Acts 2:46

Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They shared meals in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts,

## Acts 2:47

praising God and enjoying the goodwill of all the people. And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.
