# Acts Chapter 23

## Acts 23:1

Paul, looking intently at the Council, said, “Brothers, I have conducted myself with a clear conscience before God up to this day.”

## Acts 23:2

At this, the high priest Ananias commanded those standing near him to strike Paul on the mouth.

## Acts 23:3

Paul responded, “God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! You sit there to judge me according to the law, yet in violation of the law, you order me to be struck!”

## Acts 23:4

Those standing nearby said, “Do you dare to insult God’s high priest?”

## Acts 23:5

Paul replied, “I was not aware, brothers, that he was the high priest; for it is written: ‘You must not speak evil of a ruler of your people.’”

## Acts 23:6

Perceiving that some were Sadducees and others Pharisees, Paul called out in the Council, “Brothers, I am a Pharisee, descended from Pharisees. I am on trial concerning the hope of the resurrection of the dead.”

## Acts 23:7

When he said this, a dissension arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.

## Acts 23:8

(The Sadducees say there is no resurrection, nor angels, nor spirits, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all.)

## Acts 23:9

A great uproar ensued, and some of the scribes of the Pharisaic party stood up and argued fiercely, saying, “We find nothing wrong with this man. Suppose a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?”

## Acts 23:10

The dissension became so intense that the commander feared Paul might be torn apart by them. He ordered the troops to go down, take him by force, and bring him into the barracks.

## Acts 23:11

That night, the Lord appeared to Paul and said, “Be encouraged! Just as you have testified about me in Jerusalem, you must also testify in Rome.”

---

## Acts 23:12

The following morning, a group of Jews devised a plan and took an oath not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul.

## Acts 23:13

Over forty men participated in this scheme.

## Acts 23:14

They went to the chief priests and elders and said, “We have taken a solemn oath not to eat anything until we have killed Paul.

## Acts 23:15

Now you and the Council should petition the commander to bring him down to you, as if you were going to examine his case more thoroughly. We are ready to kill him before he arrives.”

---

## Acts 23:16

But when the son of Paul’s sister heard of this ambush, he went into the barracks and informed Paul.

## Acts 23:17

Paul called one of the centurions and said, “Take this young man to the commander; he has something to report to him.”

## Acts 23:18

So the centurion took him to the commander and said, “Paul, the prisoner, called me and asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you.”

## Acts 23:19

The commander took him by the hand, drew him aside, and asked privately, “What do you have to report to me?”

## Acts 23:20

He said, “The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the Council tomorrow, as though they were going to inquire more thoroughly about him.

## Acts 23:21

Do not be persuaded by them, for more than forty of them are lying in wait to ambush him. They have taken an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him. They are ready now, awaiting your consent.”

## Acts 23:22

The commander dismissed the young man with this instruction: “Do not tell anyone that you have reported this to me.”

## Acts 23:23

Then he summoned two of his centurions and instructed them, “Prepare two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen to go to Caesarea at the third hour of the night.

## Acts 23:24

Provide mounts for Paul so that he may be taken safely to Governor Felix.”

---

## Acts 23:25

He wrote a letter with the following content:

## Acts 23:26

“Claudius Lysias, to the most excellent Governor Felix: Greetings.

## Acts 23:27

This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them, but I intervened with the troops and rescued him, having learned that he is a Roman citizen.

## Acts 23:28

Wishing to ascertain the basis for the accusations against him, I brought him to their Council.

## Acts 23:29

I discovered that he was accused over questions of their law, but had no charge deserving death or imprisonment.

## Acts 23:30

When I was informed of a plot against him, I sent him to you at once, ordering his accusers to present their case against him before you.”

---

## Acts 23:31

So the soldiers, following their orders, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.

## Acts 23:32

The next day, they allowed the horsemen to continue with him, while they returned to the barracks.

## Acts 23:33

When the horsemen arrived in Caesarea, they delivered the letter to the governor and handed over Paul.

## Acts 23:34

The governor read the letter and inquired from which province Paul was. Upon learning that he was from Cilicia,

## Acts 23:35

he said, “I will hear your case when your accusers arrive.” Then he ordered that Paul be kept under guard in Herod’s Praetorium.
