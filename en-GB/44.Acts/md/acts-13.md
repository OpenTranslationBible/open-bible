# Acts Chapter 13

## Acts 13:1

In the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen (who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch), and Saul.

## Acts 13:2

While they were worshipping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.”

## Acts 13:3

After they had fasted and prayed, they laid their hands on them and sent them on their way.

## Acts 13:4

So, sent forth by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia and sailed from there to Cyprus.

## Acts 13:5

Upon arriving at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. John was with them as their assistant.

## Acts 13:6

They travelled through the whole island until they reached Paphos. There they encountered a Jewish sorcerer and false prophet named Bar-Jesus,

## Acts 13:7

who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. The proconsul summoned Barnabas and Saul because he desired to hear the word of God.

## Acts 13:8

But Elymas the sorcerer (for that is the translation of his name) opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul away from the faith.

## Acts 13:9

Then Saul, also known as Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him

## Acts 13:10

and said, “You are full of deceit and fraud, a son of the devil, an enemy of all righteousness. Will you not stop perverting the straight ways of the Lord?

## Acts 13:11

Now the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind, unable to see the sun for a time.” Immediately mist and darkness fell upon him, and he went about seeking someone to lead him by the hand.

## Acts 13:12

When the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, being amazed at the teaching of the Lord.

## Acts 13:13

Paul and his companions set sail from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia, where John left them to return to Jerusalem.

## Acts 13:14

From Perga they continued to Pisidian Antioch. On the Sabbath they went into the synagogue and sat down.

## Acts 13:15

After the reading from the Law and the Prophets, the synagogue leaders sent word to them, saying, “Brothers, if you have a word of encouragement for the people, please speak.”

## Acts 13:16

Paul stood up, motioned with his hand, and said: “Men of Israel and you who fear God, listen:

## Acts 13:17

The God of the people of Israel chose our ancestors and made the people prosper during their stay in Egypt, and with an uplifted arm He led them out of it.

## Acts 13:18

For about forty years He endured their conduct in the wilderness.

## Acts 13:19

He overthrew seven nations in Canaan, giving their land to His people as an inheritance.

## Acts 13:20

All this took about 450 years. After this, He gave them judges until the time of Samuel the prophet.

## Acts 13:21

Then the people asked for a king, and God gave them Saul son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, who ruled for forty years.

## Acts 13:22

After removing him, He raised up David to be their king. God testified concerning him: ‘I have found David son of Jesse, a man after My own heart; he will do everything I want him to do.’

## Acts 13:23

From this man’s descendants God has brought to Israel the Saviour Jesus, as He promised.

## Acts 13:24

Before the coming of Jesus, John preached a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.

## Acts 13:25

As John was completing his work, he said: ‘Who do you suppose I am? I am not He. But there is one coming after me whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.’

## Acts 13:26

“Brothers, children of Abraham’s family, and you God-fearing Gentiles, it is to us that this message of salvation has been sent.

## Acts 13:27

The people of Jerusalem and their rulers did not recognise Jesus, yet in condemning Him they fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every Sabbath.

## Acts 13:28

Though they found no grounds for a death sentence, they asked Pilate to have Him executed.

## Acts 13:29

When they had carried out all that was written about Him, they took Him down from the cross and laid Him in a tomb.

## Acts 13:30

But God raised Him from the dead,

## Acts 13:31

and for many days He was seen by those who had travelled with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem. They are now His witnesses to our people.

## Acts 13:32

“We bring you the good news: What God promised our ancestors

## Acts 13:33

He has fulfilled for us, their children, by raising Jesus. As it is written in the second Psalm:

> ‘You are My Son;
> today I have become Your Father.’

## Acts 13:34

God raised Him from the dead so that He will never be subject to decay. As God has said,

> ‘I will give you the holy and sure blessings promised to David.’

## Acts 13:35

So it is also stated elsewhere:

> ‘You will not let Your Holy One see decay.’

## Acts 13:36

“Now when David had served God’s purpose in his own generation, he fell asleep; he was buried with his ancestors and his body decayed.

## Acts 13:37

But the one whom God raised from the dead did not see decay.

## Acts 13:38

“Therefore, my friends, let it be known to you that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you.

## Acts 13:39

Through Him everyone who believes is set free from every sin, a justification you could not obtain under the law of Moses.

## Acts 13:40

Take care that what the prophets have said does not happen to you:

## Acts 13:41

> ‘Look, you scoffers,
> wonder and perish,
> for I am going to do something in your days
> that you would never believe,
> even if someone told you.’”

## Acts 13:42

As Paul and Barnabas were leaving the synagogue, the people invited them to speak further about these things on the next Sabbath.

## Acts 13:43

When the congregation was dismissed, many of the Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who spoke with them and urged them to continue in the grace of God.

---

## Acts 13:44

On the next Sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord.

## Acts 13:45

When the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy. They began to contradict what Paul was saying and heaped abuse on him.

## Acts 13:46

Then Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly: “It was necessary to speak the word of God to you first. Since you reject it and do not consider yourselves worthy of eternal life, we now turn to the Gentiles.

## Acts 13:47

For this is what the Lord has commanded us:

> ‘I have made you a light for the Gentiles,
> that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.’”

## Acts 13:48

When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and honoured the word of the Lord; and all who were appointed for eternal life believed.

## Acts 13:49

The word of the Lord spread through the whole region.

## Acts 13:50

But the Jewish leaders incited the devout women of high standing and the leading men of the city. They stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them from their region.

## Acts 13:51

So they shook the dust off their feet in protest against them and went to Iconium.

## Acts 13:52

And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.
