# Acts Chapter 13

## Acts 13:1

Now there were prophets and teachers at Antioch, in the church that was there:  
Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.

## Acts 13:2

While they were serving the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said,  
“Set Barnabas and Saul apart for Me for the work to which I have called them.”

## Acts 13:3

Then, when they had fasted, prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.

---

## Acts 13:4

So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia,  
and from there they sailed to Cyprus.

## Acts 13:5

When they reached Salamis, they began to proclaim the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews;  
and they also had John as their assistant.

## Acts 13:6

When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos,  
they found a magician, a Jewish false prophet whose name was Bar-Jesus,

## Acts 13:7

who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence.  
This man summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God.

## Acts 13:8

But Elymas the magician (for so his name is translated) was opposing them,  
seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith.

## Acts 13:9

But Saul, who was also known as Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, stared at him,

## Acts 13:10

and said,  
“You who are full of all deceit and fraud, you son of the devil,  
you enemy of all righteousness, will you not stop making crooked the straight ways of the Lord?

## Acts 13:11

Now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind and unable to see the sun for a time.”  
And immediately a mist and darkness fell upon him,  
and he went around seeking people to lead him by the hand.

## Acts 13:12

Then the proconsul believed when he saw what had happened, being amazed at the teaching of the Lord.

---

## Acts 13:13

Now Paul and his companions put out to sea from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia;  
but John left them and returned to Jerusalem.

## Acts 13:14

But going on from Perga, they arrived at Pisidian Antioch,  
and on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down.

## Acts 13:15

After the reading of the Law and the Prophets,  
the synagogue officials sent word to them, saying,  
“Brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say it.”

## Acts 13:16

Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said,  
“Men of Israel, and you who fear God, listen:

## Acts 13:17

The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great  
during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm He led them out from it.

## Acts 13:18

For a period of about forty years He put up with them in the wilderness.

## Acts 13:19

When He had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan,  
He distributed their land as an inheritance—all of which took about 450 years.

## Acts 13:20

After these things He gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.

## Acts 13:21

Then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish,  
a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.

## Acts 13:22

After He had removed him, He raised up David to be their king,  
concerning whom He also testified and said,  
‘I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man after My heart, who will do all My will.’

## Acts 13:23

From the descendants of this man, according to promise, God has brought to Israel a Saviour, Jesus,

## Acts 13:24

after John had proclaimed, before His coming, a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.

## Acts 13:25

And while John was completing his course, he kept saying,  
‘What do you suppose that I am? I am not He.  
But behold, One is coming after me the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.’

## Acts 13:26

“Brothers, sons of Abraham’s family, and those among you who fear God,  
to us the message of this salvation has been sent.

## Acts 13:27

For those who live in Jerusalem, and their rulers,  
recognising neither Him nor the declarations of the prophets which are read every Sabbath,  
fulfilled these by condemning Him.

## Acts 13:28

And though they found no grounds for putting Him to death,  
they asked Pilate that He be executed.

## Acts 13:29

When they had carried out everything that was written concerning Him,  
they took Him down from the cross and laid Him in a tomb.

## Acts 13:30

But God raised Him from the dead;

## Acts 13:31

and for many days He appeared to those who came up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem,  
the very ones who are now His witnesses to the people.

## Acts 13:32

And we preach to you the good news of the promise made to the fathers,

## Acts 13:33

that God has fulfilled this promise to our children by raising Jesus,  
as it is also written in the second Psalm:

> ‘You are My Son;
> today I have fathered You.’

## Acts 13:34

As for the fact that He raised Him from the dead, never again to return to decay,  
He has spoken in this way:

> ‘I will give you the holy and faithful mercies of David.’

## Acts 13:35

Therefore He also says in another Psalm:

> ‘You will not allow Your Holy One to undergo decay.’

## Acts 13:36

For David, after he had served God’s purpose in his own generation, fell asleep,  
and was buried among his fathers and underwent decay;

## Acts 13:37

but He whom God raised did not undergo decay.

## Acts 13:38

Therefore let it be known to you, brothers, that through this Man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you,

## Acts 13:39

and through Him everyone who believes is freed from all things,  
from which you could not be freed through the Law of Moses.

## Acts 13:40

Therefore, see that the thing spoken of in the Prophets does not come upon you:

## Acts 13:41

> ‘Look, you scoffers,
> and be astonished, and perish;  
> For I am accomplishing a work in your days,  
> A work you will never believe,
> though someone should describe it to you.’”

---

## Acts 13:42

As Paul and Barnabas were going out, the people repeatedly begged to have these things spoken to them the next Sabbath.

## Acts 13:43

Now when the meeting of the synagogue had broken up,  
many of the Jews and of the God-fearing proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas,  
who were speaking to them and urging them to continue in the grace of God.

---

## Acts 13:44

The next Sabbath, nearly all the city assembled to hear the word of the Lord.

## Acts 13:45

But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy  
and began contradicting the things spoken by Paul, and were blaspheming.

## Acts 13:46

Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly and said,  
“It was necessary that the word of God be spoken to you first;  
since you repudiate it and consider yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we are turning to the Gentiles.

## Acts 13:47

For so the Lord has commanded us:

> ‘I have appointed You as a light to the Gentiles,  
> That You may bring salvation to the end of the earth.’”

## Acts 13:48

When the Gentiles heard this, they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord;  
and all who had been appointed to eternal life believed.

## Acts 13:49

And the word of the Lord was being spread through the whole region.

## Acts 13:50

But the Jews incited the devout women of prominence and the leading men of the city,  
and instigated a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their region.

## Acts 13:51

But they shook the dust off their feet in protest against them and went to Iconium.

## Acts 13:52

And the disciples were continually filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.
