# Acts Chapter 18

## Acts 18:1

After these events, Paul departed from Athens and travelled to Corinth.

## Acts 18:2

There he encountered a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently arrived from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had decreed that all Jews should leave Rome. Paul approached them,

## Acts 18:3

and since he shared their trade, he stayed with them, and they worked together, for they were tentmakers by profession.

## Acts 18:4

Every Sabbath, Paul engaged in discussions in the synagogue, attempting to persuade both Jews and Greeks.

---

## Acts 18:5

When Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul dedicated himself fully to the word, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.

## Acts 18:6

However, when they opposed and reviled him, he shook out his garments and declared to them, “Your blood be upon your own heads! I am innocent. From now on I will turn to the Gentiles.”

## Acts 18:7

He then left the synagogue and went to the house of Titius Justus, a worshipper of God, whose house was adjacent to the synagogue.

## Acts 18:8

Crispus, the synagogue leader, believed in the Lord with his entire household; and many of the Corinthians who heard Paul believed and were baptised.

---

## Acts 18:9

One night, the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision: “Do not be afraid, but continue speaking and do not be silent;

## Acts 18:10

for I am with you, and no one will attack you or harm you, for I have many people in this city.”

## Acts 18:11

So Paul remained in Corinth for a year and six months, teaching them the word of God.

---

## Acts 18:12

While Gallio was the proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made a concerted attack on Paul and brought him before the tribunal,

## Acts 18:13

saying, “This man is persuading people to worship God in ways contrary to the law.”

## Acts 18:14

Just as Paul was about to speak, Gallio addressed the Jews, “If this were a matter of wrongdoing or a serious crime, O Jews, it would be reasonable for me to listen to you;

## Acts 18:15

but since it concerns questions about words and names and your own law, see to it yourselves. I refuse to be a judge of such matters.”

## Acts 18:16

And with that, he sent them away from the tribunal.

## Acts 18:17

Then they all seized Sosthenes, the leader of the synagogue, and beat him in front of the tribunal. But Gallio showed no concern for any of this.

---

## Acts 18:18

Paul stayed on in Corinth for a considerable time. He then took leave of the brothers and sisters and set sail for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. Before setting sail, he had his hair cut at Cenchreae because of a vow he had taken.

## Acts 18:19

They arrived at Ephesus, where he left Priscilla and Aquila. He himself entered the synagogue and engaged in discussions with the Jews.

## Acts 18:20

When they asked him to stay longer, he declined,

## Acts 18:21

but as he departed, he said, “I will return to you if God wills.” Then he set sail from Ephesus.

---

## Acts 18:22

Upon landing at Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem and greeted the church, then went down to Antioch.

## Acts 18:23

After spending some time there, Paul departed and travelled through the regions of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.

---

## Acts 18:24

Meanwhile, a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria and an eloquent man, arrived in Ephesus. He was well-versed in the Scriptures.

## Acts 18:25

He had received instruction in the teachings of the Lord and, being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, though he knew only the baptism of John.

## Acts 18:26

He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained the way of God to him more accurately.

## Acts 18:27

When Apollos wished to cross over to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him. Upon his arrival, he greatly assisted those who had believed through grace,

## Acts 18:28

for he vigorously refuted the Jews in public debate, demonstrating through the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.
