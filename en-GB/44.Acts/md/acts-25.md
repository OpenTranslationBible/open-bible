# Acts Chapter 25

## Acts 25:1

Three days after arriving in the province, Festus went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.

## Acts 25:2

The chief priests and the leaders of the Jews brought charges against Paul and pleaded with Festus.

## Acts 25:3

They requested a favour against Paul, asking that he be brought to Jerusalem, while they were planning an ambush to kill him on the way.

## Acts 25:4

Festus replied that Paul was being held in Caesarea, and that he himself was about to leave soon.

## Acts 25:5

He said, “Let the influential men among you come with me, and if there is anything wrong about the man, let them bring charges against him there.”

## Acts 25:6

After spending eight or ten days with them, Festus went down to Caesarea. The next day, he took his seat on the tribunal and ordered Paul to be brought before him.

## Acts 25:7

When Paul arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many serious charges which they could not prove.

## Acts 25:8

Paul defended himself, stating, “I have not done anything wrong against the Jewish law, the temple, or Caesar.”

## Acts 25:9

Festus, wanting to do the Jews a favour, asked Paul, “Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and stand trial on these charges before me?”

## Acts 25:10

Paul replied, “I am standing before Caesar’s tribunal, where I ought to be tried. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you know very well.

## Acts 25:11

If I am guilty and have done anything deserving death, I do not refuse to die; but if the charges against me are not true, no one has the right to hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar!”

## Acts 25:12

After conferring with his council, Festus declared, “You have appealed to Caesar; to Caesar you shall go.”

## Acts 25:13

Several days later, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived in Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus.

## Acts 25:14

Since they were spending many days there, Festus discussed Paul’s case with the king, saying, “There is a man who was left as a prisoner by Felix.

## Acts 25:15

When I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews brought charges against him, asking for a sentence of condemnation.

## Acts 25:16

I told them that it is not the Roman custom to hand over anyone before they have faced their accusers and have had the opportunity to defend themselves against the charges.

## Acts 25:17

When they came here with me, I did not delay, but convened the court the next day and ordered the man to be brought in.

## Acts 25:18

When his accusers stood up, they did not charge him with any of the crimes I had expected.

## Acts 25:19

Instead, they had some points of dispute with him about their own religion and about a dead man named Jesus, whom Paul claimed was alive.

## Acts 25:20

Being at a loss on how to investigate such matters, I asked if he was willing to go to Jerusalem and stand trial there.

## Acts 25:21

But when Paul appealed to be held for the Emperor’s decision, I ordered him to be kept in custody until I could send him to Caesar.”

## Acts 25:22

Agrippa said to Festus, “I would like to hear the man myself.” Festus replied, “Tomorrow you shall hear him.”

## Acts 25:23

The next day, Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp and entered the audience room with the high-ranking military officers and the prominent men of the city. At Festus’s command, Paul was brought in.

## Acts 25:24

Festus said, “King Agrippa, and all who are present with us, you see this man about whom the whole Jewish community has appealed to me, both in Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ought not to live any longer.

## Acts 25:25

I found he had done nothing deserving death, but since he appealed to the Emperor, I decided to send him to Rome.

## Acts 25:26

However, I have nothing definite to write to His Majesty about him. Therefore, I have brought him before all of you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after this investigation, I may have something to write.

## Acts 25:27

For it seems unreasonable to me to send a prisoner to Rome without specifying the charges against him.”
