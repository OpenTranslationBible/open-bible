# Acts Chapter 28

## Acts 28:1

When they had been brought safely through, then we found out that the island was called Malta.

## Acts 28:2

The natives showed us extraordinary kindness,  
for because of the rain that had set in and because of the cold, they kindled a fire and received us all.

## Acts 28:3

But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire,  
a viper came out because of the heat and fastened itself on his hand.

## Acts 28:4

When the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand,  
they began saying to one another, “Undoubtedly this man is a murderer,  
and though he has been saved from the sea, justice has not allowed him to live.”

## Acts 28:5

However, he shook the creature off into the fire and suffered no harm.

## Acts 28:6

They were expecting that he was going to swell up or suddenly fall down dead.  
But after they had waited a long time and had seen nothing unusual happen to him,  
they changed their minds and began to say that he was a god.

## Acts 28:7

Now in the neighbourhood of that place were lands belonging to the leading man of the island, named Publius,  
who welcomed us and entertained us courteously for three days.

## Acts 28:8

And it happened that the father of Publius was lying in bed afflicted with fever and dysentery;  
and Paul went in to see him, and after he had prayed, he laid his hands on him and healed him.

## Acts 28:9

After this happened, the rest of the people on the island who had diseases were coming to him and being cured.

## Acts 28:10

They also showed us many honours; and when we were about to set sail,  
they supplied us with everything we needed.

---

## Acts 28:11

After three months we set sail on an Alexandrian ship which had wintered at the island,  
and which had the Twin Brothers as its figurehead.

## Acts 28:12

After we put in at Syracuse, we stayed there for three days.

## Acts 28:13

From there we sailed around and arrived at Rhegium,  
and a day later a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli.

## Acts 28:14

There we found some brothers and were invited to stay with them for seven days;  
and in this way we came to Rome.

## Acts 28:15

And from there the brothers, when they heard about us,  
came as far as the Market of Appius and Three Inns to meet us;  
and when Paul saw them, he thanked God and took courage.

---

## Acts 28:16

When we entered Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself, with the soldier who was guarding him.

---

## Acts 28:17

After three days Paul called together those who were the leading men of the Jews,  
and when they came together, he began saying to them,  
“Brothers, though I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers,  
yet I was handed over to the Romans as a prisoner from Jerusalem.

## Acts 28:18

And when they had interrogated me, they were willing to release me because there were no grounds for putting me to death.

## Acts 28:19

But when the Jews objected, I was forced to appeal to Caesar,  
not that I had any accusation against my nation.

## Acts 28:20

For this reason, therefore, I requested to see you and to speak with you,  
since I am wearing this chain for the sake of the hope of Israel.”

## Acts 28:21

They said to him,  
“We have neither received letters from Judea concerning you,  
nor has any of the brothers come here and reported or spoken anything bad about you.

## Acts 28:22

But we desire to hear from you what your views are;  
for regarding this sect, it is known to us that it is spoken against everywhere.”

## Acts 28:23

When they had set a day for Paul, they came to him at his lodging in large numbers;  
and he was explaining to them by solemnly testifying about the kingdom of God  
and trying to persuade them concerning Jesus, from both the Law of Moses and from the Prophets,  
from morning until evening.

## Acts 28:24

Some were being persuaded by the things said by Paul, but others would not believe.

## Acts 28:25

And when they disagreed with one another, they began leaving after Paul had said one parting statement:  
“The Holy Spirit rightly spoke through Isaiah the prophet to your fathers,

## Acts 28:26

saying,

> ‘Go to this people and say,  
> “You will keep on hearing, and will not understand;  
> And you will keep on seeing, and will not perceive;

## Acts 28:27

> For the hearts of this people have become insensitive,  
> And with their ears they hardly hear,  
> And they have closed their eyes,  
> Otherwise they might see with their eyes,  
> Hear with their ears,  
> Understand with their heart, and return,  
> And I would heal them.”’

## Acts 28:28

Therefore, let it be known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles; they will listen also.”

---

## Acts 28:29

[When he had said these things, the Jews left, having a great dispute among themselves.]

## Acts 28:30

Now Paul stayed two full years in his own rented lodging and welcomed all who came to him,

## Acts 28:31

preaching the kingdom of God and teaching things about the Lord Jesus Christ with all openness, unhindered.
