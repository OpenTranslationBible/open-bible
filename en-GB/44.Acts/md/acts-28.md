# Acts Chapter 28

## Acts 28:1

Once we had reached safety, we discovered that the island was named Malta.

## Acts 28:2

The islanders displayed remarkable kindness to us; they lit a fire and welcomed us all, as it was rainy and cold.

## Acts 28:3

Paul gathered a bundle of sticks and placed them on the fire, and a viper, driven out by the heat, latched onto his hand.

## Acts 28:4

When the islanders observed the snake hanging from his hand, they said to one another, “This man must indeed be a murderer; although he escaped the sea, justice has not permitted him to live.”

## Acts 28:5

Paul, however, shook the snake off into the fire and suffered no harm.

## Acts 28:6

The people anticipated that he would swell up or suddenly fall dead, but after waiting a long time and seeing nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and declared he was a god.

## Acts 28:7

In the vicinity, there was an estate belonging to Publius, the chief official of the island. He welcomed us and showed us generous hospitality for three days.

## Acts 28:8

Publius's father was bedridden, suffering from fever and dysentery. Paul visited him, and after praying, laid his hands on him and healed him.

## Acts 28:9

Following this event, the rest of the island's sick came and were healed.

## Acts 28:10

The islanders honoured us in many ways, and when we were ready to set sail, they provided us with the necessary supplies.

## Acts 28:11

After three months, we set sail on an Alexandrian ship that had wintered on the island, with the figurehead of the twin gods Castor and Pollux.

## Acts 28:12

We arrived at Syracuse and stayed there for three days.

## Acts 28:13

From there, we sailed and reached Rhegium. A day later, a south wind arose, and on the following day, we arrived at Puteoli.

## Acts 28:14

There, we found some brothers and sisters who invited us to stay with them for a week. And so we came to Rome.

## Acts 28:15

The brothers and sisters there, having heard of our arrival, travelled as far as the Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us. Upon seeing them, Paul thanked God and took courage.

---

## Acts 28:16

When we arrived in Rome, Paul was permitted to live by himself, with a soldier to guard him.

## Acts 28:17

Three days later, Paul called together the local Jewish leaders. When they had gathered, he said to them, “Brothers, although I have done nothing against our people or the customs of our ancestors, I was arrested in Jerusalem and handed over to the Romans.

## Acts 28:18

They examined me and intended to release me, as I was not guilty of any crime deserving death.

## Acts 28:19

But when the Jews objected, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, not that I had any accusation against my nation.

## Acts 28:20

For this reason, I have requested to see you and speak with you, for it is because of the hope of Israel that I am bound with this chain.”

## Acts 28:21

They replied, “We have not received any letters from Judea about you, nor have any of the brothers who have come here reported or spoken anything bad about you.

## Acts 28:22

But we wish to hear your views, for we know that people everywhere are speaking against this sect.”

## Acts 28:23

They arranged to meet Paul on a certain day, and more people came to his lodging. He explained to them from morning till evening, testifying about the kingdom of God and trying to persuade them about Jesus from both the Law of Moses and the Prophets.

## Acts 28:24

Some were convinced by his words, but others refused to believe.

## Acts 28:25

They disagreed among themselves and began to leave after Paul made this final remark: “The Holy Spirit spoke rightly through Isaiah the prophet to your ancestors,

## Acts 28:26

saying,

> ‘Go to this people and say,
> “You will be ever hearing but never understanding;
> you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.”

## Acts 28:27

> For the hearts of this people have grown dull;
> they scarcely hear with their ears,
> and they have shut their eyes.
> Otherwise, they might see with their eyes,
> hear with their ears, understand with their hearts and turn,
> and I would heal them.’

## Acts 28:28

“Therefore, understand that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen.”

---

## Acts 28:29

[When he had said these things, the Jews left, having a great dispute among themselves.]

## Acts 28:30

Paul remained there for two full years in his own rented house and welcomed all who came to him,

## Acts 28:31

proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, without hindrance.
