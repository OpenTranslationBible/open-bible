# Acts Chapter 10

## Acts 10:1

In Caesarea, there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion of what was known as the Italian Regiment.

## Acts 10:2

He was a devout man who, along with his entire household, feared God. He gave generously to the Jewish people and prayed to God regularly.

## Acts 10:3

Around three in the afternoon, he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God, who came to him and said, “Cornelius!”

## Acts 10:4

Cornelius looked at him intently and was filled with fear. “What is it, Lord?” he asked. The angel said, “Your prayers and gifts to the poor have ascended as a memorial offering before God.

## Acts 10:5

Now send men to Joppa to bring back a man named Simon, who is also called Peter.

## Acts 10:6

He is lodging with Simon the tanner, whose house is located by the sea.”

## Acts 10:7

When the angel who spoke to him had departed, he summoned two of his servants and a devout soldier from among his attendants.

## Acts 10:8

After providing them with all the necessary details, he sent them to Joppa.

## Acts 10:9

The following day, as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the roof about noon to pray.

## Acts 10:10

He felt hungry and desired something to eat, and while the meal was being prepared, he fell into a trance.

## Acts 10:11

He saw the heavens opened and something resembling a large sheet being lowered to earth by its four corners.

## Acts 10:12

In it were all kinds of four-footed animals, as well as reptiles and birds.

## Acts 10:13

Then a voice said to him, “Arise, Peter; kill and eat.”

## Acts 10:14

But Peter replied, “By no means, Lord! I have never eaten anything impure or unclean.”

## Acts 10:15

The voice spoke to him again, “What God has made clean, do not call impure.”

## Acts 10:16

This occurred three times, and immediately the sheet was taken back to heaven.

## Acts 10:17

While Peter was wondering about the meaning of the vision, the men sent by Cornelius found Simon’s house and stood at the gate.

## Acts 10:18

They called out, asking if Simon, who was also known as Peter, was staying there.

## Acts 10:19

While Peter was still reflecting on the vision, the Spirit said to him, “Look, three men are searching for you.

## Acts 10:20

Get up, go downstairs, and accompany them without hesitation, for I have sent them.”

---

## Acts 10:21

Peter went down to the men and said, “I am the one you are seeking. What is the reason for your visit?”

## Acts 10:22

They replied, “Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous and God-fearing man, well spoken of by the entire Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to summon you to his house to hear what you have to say.”

## Acts 10:23

So Peter invited them in and gave them lodging. The next day, he got ready and went with them, accompanied by some of the believers from Joppa.

## Acts 10:24

The following day, he arrived in Caesarea. Cornelius was anticipating their arrival and had gathered his relatives and close friends.

## Acts 10:25

As Peter entered, Cornelius met him and fell at his feet in reverence.

## Acts 10:26

But Peter helped him up, saying, “Stand up. I am merely a man myself.”

## Acts 10:27

While conversing with him, Peter went inside and found a large gathering of people.

## Acts 10:28

He said to them: “You are aware that it is against our law for a Jew to associate with or visit a Gentile. But God has shown me that I should not call anyone impure or unclean.

## Acts 10:29

So when I was sent for, I came without raising any objection. May I inquire as to the reason you sent for me?”

---

## Acts 10:30

Cornelius answered, “Four days ago, at this very hour, I was praying in my house at the ninth hour, and suddenly a man in shining clothes stood before me

## Acts 10:31

and said, ‘Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your gifts to the poor have been remembered before God.

## Acts 10:32

Send to Joppa for Simon, who is also called Peter. He is staying at the house of Simon the tanner, by the sea.’

## Acts 10:33

So I sent for you immediately, and you have been kind enough to come. Now we are all here in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has commanded you to tell us.”

---

## Acts 10:34

Then Peter began to speak: “I now truly understand that God shows no partiality

## Acts 10:35

but welcomes from every nation the one who fears Him and does what is right.

## Acts 10:36

You are aware of the message God sent to the people of Israel, proclaiming the good news of peace through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all.

## Acts 10:37

You know what has happened throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached—

## Acts 10:38

how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and power, and how He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, because God was with Him.

## Acts 10:39

We are witnesses of everything He did in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They killed Him by hanging Him on a cross,

## Acts 10:40

but God raised Him from the dead on the third day and allowed Him to be seen,

## Acts 10:41

not by all the people, but by witnesses whom God had already chosen—by us who ate and drank with Him after He rose from the dead.

## Acts 10:42

He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that He is the one appointed by God as judge of the living and the dead.

## Acts 10:43

All the prophets testify about Him that everyone who believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins through His name.”

## Acts 10:44

While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came upon all who were listening to the message.

## Acts 10:45

The Jewish believers who had come with Peter were amazed that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles.

## Acts 10:46

For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God. Then Peter said,

## Acts 10:47

“Surely no one can prevent these people from being baptised with water. They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have.”

## Acts 10:48

So he directed that they be baptised in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days.
