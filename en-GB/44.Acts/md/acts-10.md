# Acts Chapter 10

## Acts 10:1

Now there was a man in Caesarea named Cornelius, a centurion of what was called the Italian cohort,

## Acts 10:2

a devout man and one who feared God with all his household,  
and made many charitable contributions to the Jewish people and prayed to God continually.

## Acts 10:3

About the ninth hour of the day he clearly saw in a vision an angel of God  
who had just come in and said to him, “Cornelius!”

## Acts 10:4

And he looked at him intently and became terrified, and said, “What is it, lord?”  
And he said to him,  
“Your prayers and charitable gifts have ascended as a memorial offering before God.

## Acts 10:5

Now dispatch some men to Joppa and send for a man named Simon, who is also called Peter;

## Acts 10:6

he is staying with a tanner named Simon, whose house is by the sea.”

## Acts 10:7

When the angel who spoke to him had left, he summoned two of his servants and a devout soldier from his personal attendants,

## Acts 10:8

and after he had explained everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.

## Acts 10:9

On the next day, as they were on their way and approaching the city,  
Peter went up on the housetop about the sixth hour to pray.

## Acts 10:10

But he became hungry and wanted to eat; but while they were preparing the food, he fell into a trance;

## Acts 10:11

and he _saw_ the sky opened up, and an object like a great sheet coming down,  
lowered by four corners to the ground,

## Acts 10:12

and on it were all kinds of four-footed animals and crawling creatures of the earth, and birds of the sky.

## Acts 10:13

A voice came to him, “Get up, Peter, kill and eat!”

## Acts 10:14

But Peter said, “By no means, Lord, for I have never eaten anything unholy and unclean.”

## Acts 10:15

Again a voice came to him a second time,  
“What God has cleansed, no longer consider unholy.”

## Acts 10:16

This happened three times, and immediately the object was taken up into the sky.

## Acts 10:17

Now while Peter was greatly perplexed in mind as to what the vision which he had seen might mean,  
behold, the men who had been sent by Cornelius had asked for directions to Simon’s house,  
and they appeared at the gate;

## Acts 10:18

and calling out, they were asking whether Simon, who was also called Peter, was staying there.

## Acts 10:19

While Peter was reflecting on the vision, the Spirit said to him,  
“Behold, three men are looking for you.

## Acts 10:20

But get up, go downstairs and accompany them without misgivings, for I have sent them Myself.”

---

## Acts 10:21

Peter went down to the men and said,  
“Behold, I am the one you are looking for; what is the reason for which you have come?”

## Acts 10:22

They said,  
“Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous and God-fearing man well spoken of by the entire nation of the Jews,  
was divinely directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and hear a message from you.”

## Acts 10:23

So he invited them in and gave them lodging.  
Now on the next day he got ready and went away with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him.

---

## Acts 10:24

On the following day he entered Caesarea.  
Now Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends.

## Acts 10:25

When Peter entered, Cornelius met him, and fell at his feet and worshiped him.

## Acts 10:26

But Peter helped him up, saying, “Stand up; I too am just a man.”

## Acts 10:27

As he talked with him, he entered and _found_ many people assembled.

## Acts 10:28

And he said to them,  
“You yourselves know that it is forbidden for a Jewish man to associate with or visit a foreigner;  
and yet God has shown me that I am not to call any person unholy or unclean.

## Acts 10:29

That is why I came without even raising any objection when I was sent for.  
So I ask, for what reason did you send for me?”

---

## Acts 10:30

Cornelius said,  
“Four days ago to this hour, I was praying in my house during the ninth hour;  
and behold, a man stood before me in shining clothing,

## Acts 10:31

and he _said_, ‘Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your charitable gifts have been remembered before God.

## Acts 10:32

Therefore send some men to Joppa and invite Simon, who is also called Peter, to come to you;  
he is staying at the house of Simon the tanner, by the sea.’

## Acts 10:33

So I sent men to you immediately, and you have been kind enough to come.  
Now then, we are all here present before God to hear everything that you have been commanded by the Lord.”

---

## Acts 10:34

Opening his mouth, Peter said:  
“I most certainly understand now that God is not one to show partiality,

## Acts 10:35

but in every nation the one who fears Him and does what is right is acceptable to Him.

## Acts 10:36

The word which He sent to the sons of Israel, preaching peace through Jesus Christ (He is Lord of all)—

## Acts 10:37

you yourselves know the thing that happened throughout Judea, starting from Galilee,  
after the baptism which John proclaimed.

## Acts 10:38

You know of Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed Him with the Holy Spirit and with power,  
and how He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil,  
for God was with Him.

## Acts 10:39

We are witnesses of all the things that He did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem.  
They also put Him to death by hanging Him on a cross.

## Acts 10:40

God raised Him up on the third day and granted that He be revealed,

## Acts 10:41

not to all the people, but to witnesses who had been chosen beforehand by God,  
that is, to us who ate and drank with Him after He arose from the dead.

## Acts 10:42

And He ordered us to preach to the people, and to testify solemnly that this is the One  
who has been appointed by God as Judge of the living and the dead.

## Acts 10:43

All the prophets testify of Him, that through His name everyone who believes in Him receives forgiveness of sins.”

---

## Acts 10:44

While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who were listening to the message.

## Acts 10:45

All the Jewish believers who came with Peter were amazed,  
because the gift of the Holy Spirit had also been poured out on the Gentiles.

## Acts 10:46

For they were hearing them speaking with tongues and exalting God.  
Then Peter responded,

## Acts 10:47

“Surely no one can refuse the water for these to be baptised, who have received the Holy Spirit just as we did, can he?”

## Acts 10:48

And he ordered them to be baptised in the name of Jesus Christ.  
Then they asked him to stay on for a few days.
