# Acts Chapter 7

## Acts 7:1

The high priest then inquired of Stephen, “Are these accusations accurate?”

## Acts 7:2

Stephen responded, “Brothers and fathers, hear me! The God of glory appeared to our ancestor Abraham while he was in Mesopotamia, before he resided in Haran.

## Acts 7:3

And He instructed him, ‘Depart from your country and your kin, and proceed to the land I will reveal to you.’

## Acts 7:4

So Abraham departed from the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. After his father's death, God moved him to this land where you now live.

## Acts 7:5

He did not grant him any inheritance here, not even a foot of ground. Yet He promised to give it to him as a possession, and to his descendants after him, even though he had no child at that time.

## Acts 7:6

God spoke thus: ‘Your descendants will be strangers in a land not their own, and they will be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred years.

## Acts 7:7

But I will judge the nation they serve as slaves,’ said God, ‘and afterwards they will come out and worship Me in this place.’

## Acts 7:8

Then He gave him the covenant of circumcision. So Abraham became the father of Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs.

## Acts 7:9

“The patriarchs, out of jealousy, sold Joseph into Egypt. But God was with him,

## Acts 7:10

and delivered him from all his tribulations, granting him favour and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who appointed him governor over Egypt and his entire household.

## Acts 7:11

“Then a famine came upon all Egypt and Canaan, causing great affliction, and our ancestors could not find food.

## Acts 7:12

When Jacob learned there was grain in Egypt, he sent our forefathers on their first journey.

## Acts 7:13

On their second visit, Joseph revealed his identity to his brothers, and Pharaoh came to know of Joseph’s family.

## Acts 7:14

Joseph then sent for his father Jacob and all his relatives, seventy-five in total.

## Acts 7:15

Jacob went down to Egypt, where he and our ancestors died.

## Acts 7:16

Their bodies were brought back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham had purchased from the sons of Hamor in Shechem for a sum of money.

---

## Acts 7:17

“As the time approached for God to fulfil His promise to Abraham, the population of our people in Egypt increased greatly.

## Acts 7:18

Until a new king arose over Egypt who did not know Joseph.

## Acts 7:19

This king exploited our people and oppressed our ancestors, forcing them to abandon their infants so they would not survive.

## Acts 7:20

“At that time Moses was born, and he was no ordinary child. He was cared for in his father's house for three months.

## Acts 7:21

When he was set outside, Pharaoh’s daughter took him and raised him as her own son.

## Acts 7:22

Moses was taught in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was influential in his words and actions.

## Acts 7:23

“When he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren, the Israelites.

## Acts 7:24

Seeing one of them being wronged, he defended him and avenged the oppressed by striking down the Egyptian.

## Acts 7:25

He assumed his brethren would understand that God was granting them deliverance through him, but they did not.

## Acts 7:26

The next day, he came upon two Israelites fighting and tried to reconcile them, saying, ‘Men, you are brothers; why do you wrong each other?’

## Acts 7:27

But the one who was injuring his neighbour pushed him aside, saying, ‘Who made you a ruler and judge over us?

## Acts 7:28

Are you planning to kill me as you did the Egyptian yesterday?’

## Acts 7:29

At this remark, Moses fled and became a foreigner in the land of Midian, where he became the father of two sons.

## Acts 7:30

“After forty years had passed, an angel appeared to him in the flames of a burning bush in the desert near Mount Sinai.

## Acts 7:31

When Moses saw it, he marvelled at the sight. As he approached to observe more closely, the voice of the Lord came to him:

## Acts 7:32

‘I am the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.’ Moses trembled with fear and did not dare to look.

## Acts 7:33

Then the Lord instructed him, ‘Remove your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.

## Acts 7:34

I have indeed seen the oppression of My people in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning. I have come down to deliver them. Now come, I will send you back to Egypt.’

---

## Acts 7:35

“This Moses whom they rejected, saying, ‘Who made you a ruler and judge?’ is the one God sent as both ruler and deliverer, with the help of the angel who appeared to him in the bush.

## Acts 7:36

He led them out, performing wonders and signs in Egypt, at the Red Sea, and for forty years in the wilderness.

## Acts 7:37

“This is the Moses who told the Israelites, ‘God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own people.’

## Acts 7:38

He was with the congregation in the wilderness, with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our ancestors; and he received living words to pass on to us.

## Acts 7:39

“But our ancestors refused to obey him. Instead, they rejected him and in their hearts longed to return to Egypt.

## Acts 7:40

They told Aaron, ‘Make us gods who will go before us. As for this Moses who led us out of Egypt—we do not know what has happened to him!’

## Acts 7:41

At that time they made an idol in the form of a calf. They brought sacrifices to it and rejoiced in what their own hands had made.

## Acts 7:42

But God turned away from them and gave them over to the worship of the sun, moon, and stars. As it is written in the book of the prophets:

> ‘Did you offer Me sacrifices and offerings
> for forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?

## Acts 7:43

> You have taken up the tabernacle of Moloch
> and the star of your god Rephan,
> the idols you made to worship.
> Therefore, I will send you into exile beyond Babylon.’

---

## Acts 7:44

“Our ancestors had the tabernacle of the covenant law with them in the wilderness. It was made as God directed Moses, according to the pattern he had seen.

## Acts 7:45

Our ancestors received it and brought it with Joshua when they dispossessed the nations God drove out before them. It remained in the land until the time of David,

## Acts 7:46

who found favour with God and asked that he might provide a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.

## Acts 7:47

Yet it was Solomon who built a house for Him.

## Acts 7:48

Nevertheless, the Most High does not reside in structures made by human hands. As the prophet says:

## Acts 7:49

> ‘Heaven is My throne,
> and the earth is My footstool.
> What kind of house will you construct for Me?’ says the Lord.
> ‘Or where will My resting place be?

## Acts 7:50

> Is it not My hand that made all these things?’

---

## Acts 7:51

“You stiff-necked people, uncircumcised in heart and ears! You always resist the Holy Spirit; you are just like your ancestors.

## Acts 7:52

Which of the prophets did your ancestors ever fail to persecute? They killed those who announced the coming of the Righteous One, and now you have become His betrayers and murderers—

## Acts 7:53

you who received the law given through angels but have not kept it.”

---

## Acts 7:54

When the members of the Sanhedrin heard this, they were enraged and gnashed their teeth at him.

## Acts 7:55

But Stephen, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked up to heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.

## Acts 7:56

“Behold,” he said, “I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.”

## Acts 7:57

At this, they cried out with loud voices, covered their ears, and rushed at him in unison.

## Acts 7:58

They dragged him out of the city and began to stone him. Meanwhile, the witnesses laid their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul.

## Acts 7:59

As they stoned Stephen, he called out, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!”

## Acts 7:60

Then he fell on his knees and cried out, “Lord, do not hold this sin against them.” Having said this, he fell asleep.
