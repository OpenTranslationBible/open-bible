# Acts Chapter 17

## Acts 17:1

When Paul and his companions travelled through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they arrived at Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.

## Acts 17:2

According to his usual practice, Paul went into the synagogue, and for three Sabbaths he reasoned with them from the Scriptures,

## Acts 17:3

explaining and demonstrating that the Christ had to suffer and rise from the dead, saying, “This Jesus whom I am proclaiming to you is the Christ.”

## Acts 17:4

Some of the Jews were convinced and joined Paul and Silas, along with a large number of God-fearing Greeks and a considerable number of prominent women.

## Acts 17:5

But the Jews, becoming envious, gathered some wicked men from the marketplace, formed a mob, and set the city in an uproar; they attacked Jason’s house, seeking to bring them out to the people.

## Acts 17:6

When they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some other believers before the city authorities, shouting, “These men who have caused trouble all over the world have now come here,

## Acts 17:7

and Jason has welcomed them. They are all acting against Caesar’s decrees, saying that there is another king, Jesus.”

## Acts 17:8

The crowd and the city officials were stirred up when they heard these things.

## Acts 17:9

After they had taken security from Jason and the others, they released them.

## Acts 17:10

That night, the believers immediately sent Paul and Silas away to Berea. Upon arrival, they went to the synagogue of the Jews.

## Acts 17:11

The Berean Jews were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures daily to see if what Paul said was true.

## Acts 17:12

Consequently, many of them believed, along with a significant number of prominent Greek women and men.

## Acts 17:13

But when the Jews of Thessalonica learned that Paul was proclaiming the word of God in Berea as well, they came there too, agitating and stirring up the crowds.

## Acts 17:14

The believers immediately sent Paul to the coast, while Silas and Timothy remained in Berea.

## Acts 17:15

Those who escorted Paul brought him as far as Athens, and after receiving instructions for Silas and Timothy to join him as soon as possible, they departed.

## Acts 17:16

While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he observed that the city was full of idols.

## Acts 17:17

So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and God-fearing Greeks, and in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be present.

## Acts 17:18

Some Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also engaged him in discussion. Some said, “What is this babbler trying to say?” Others remarked, “He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign deities,” because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection.

## Acts 17:19

Then they took him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, “May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting?

## Acts 17:20

For you are bringing some strange ideas to our ears, and we want to know what they mean.”

## Acts 17:21

(All the Athenians and the foreigners living there spent their time doing nothing but talking about and listening to the latest ideas.)

## Acts 17:22

Paul then stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, “Men of Athens, I perceive that in every way you are very religious.

## Acts 17:23

For as I walked around and examined your objects of worship, I found an altar with this inscription: ‘TO AN UNKNOWN GOD.’ Therefore, what you worship in ignorance, this I proclaim to you.

## Acts 17:24

The God who made the world and everything in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made by human hands.

## Acts 17:25

Nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all people life and breath and all things.

## Acts 17:26

From one man he made every nation of mankind to inhabit the whole earth, having determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their dwelling places,

## Acts 17:27

so that they would seek God, if perhaps they might feel their way towards him and find him, though he is not far from any one of us.

## Acts 17:28

For in him we live and move and have our being, as even some of your own poets have said, ‘For we are also his offspring.’

## Acts 17:29

Therefore, since we are God’s offspring, we ought not to think that the divine nature is like gold or silver or stone, an image made by human design and skill.

## Acts 17:30

In the past, God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent,

## Acts 17:31

because he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed. He has given proof of this to everyone by raising him from the dead.”

---

## Acts 17:32

When they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some of them mocked, but others said, “We want to hear you again on this subject.”

## Acts 17:33

At that, Paul left the Council.

## Acts 17:34

Some people joined him and believed, among whom were Dionysius the Areopagite, a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
