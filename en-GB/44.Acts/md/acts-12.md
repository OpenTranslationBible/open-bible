# Acts Chapter 12

## Acts 12:1

Around this time, King Herod laid hands on some members of the church, intending to harm them.

## Acts 12:2

He had James, the brother of John, executed with the sword.

## Acts 12:3

Seeing that this pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter as well. This took place during the Festival of Unleavened Bread.

## Acts 12:4

After arresting him, he put him in prison, assigning him to be guarded by four squads of soldiers. Herod planned to bring him out for public trial after the Passover.

## Acts 12:5

Peter was kept in prison, but the church was fervently praying to God for him.

---

## Acts 12:6

The night before Herod was to bring him to trial, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, while guards stood at the entrance.

## Acts 12:7

Suddenly, an angel of the Lord appeared, and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him, saying, “Get up quickly.” The chains fell off Peter’s wrists.

## Acts 12:8

The angel instructed him, “Put on your belt and sandals.” Peter did so. Then he said, “Wrap your cloak around you and follow me.”

## Acts 12:9

Peter followed him out of the prison, but he did not realise that what was happening was real; he thought he was seeing a vision.

## Acts 12:10

They passed the first and second guards and came to the iron gate leading to the city, which opened by itself. They went through it and walked along one street, and suddenly the angel left him.

---

## Acts 12:11

Peter came to himself and said, “Now I am certain that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from Herod’s grasp and from all that the Jewish people were expecting.”

## Acts 12:12

When he realised this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John, also called Mark, where many people had gathered and were praying.

## Acts 12:13

Peter knocked at the outer entrance, and a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer.

## Acts 12:14

Recognising Peter’s voice, she was so overjoyed that she ran back without opening it and exclaimed, “Peter is at the door!”

## Acts 12:15

They said to her, “You’re out of your mind.” But she kept insisting it was true. They said, “It must be his angel.”

## Acts 12:16

Peter continued knocking, and when they opened the door and saw him, they were astonished.

## Acts 12:17

Peter motioned with his hand for them to be silent and explained how the Lord had brought him out of prison. “Tell these things to James and the brothers,” he said, and then he left for another place.

---

## Acts 12:18

In the morning, there was no small commotion among the soldiers regarding what had become of Peter.

## Acts 12:19

When Herod had searched for him and did not find him, he examined the guards and ordered their execution. Then he went down from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there.

---

## Acts 12:20

He was in conflict with the people of Tyre and Sidon. They came to him in unity, and after securing the support of Blastus, the king’s chamberlain, they sought peace because their region depended on the king’s country for food.

## Acts 12:21

On the appointed day, Herod, wearing his royal robes, sat on his throne and delivered a public address.

## Acts 12:22

The people shouted, “This is the voice of a god, not of a man.”

## Acts 12:23

Immediately, because Herod did not give glory to God, an angel of the Lord struck him down, and he was eaten by worms and died.

---

## Acts 12:24

But the word of God continued to spread and flourish.

## Acts 12:25

Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had completed their mission, taking with them John, who was also called Mark.
