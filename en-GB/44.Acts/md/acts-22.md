# Acts Chapter 22

## Acts 22:1

“Brothers and fathers, hear my defence which I now offer to you.”

## Acts 22:2

And when they heard that he was addressing them in the Hebrew dialect, they became even more quiet;  
and he _said_,

## Acts 22:3

“I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city, educated under Gamaliel,  
strictly according to the law of our fathers, being zealous for God just as you all are today.

## Acts 22:4

I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and putting both men and women into prisons,

## Acts 22:5

as also the high priest and all the Council of the elders can testify.  
From them I also received letters to the brothers, and started off for Damascus  
in order to bring even those who were there to Jerusalem as prisoners to be punished.

## Acts 22:6

But it happened that as I was on my way, approaching Damascus around noontime,  
a very bright light suddenly flashed from heaven all around me,

## Acts 22:7

and I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me,  
‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?’

## Acts 22:8

And I answered, ‘Who are You, Lord?’  
And He said to me, ‘I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you are persecuting.’

## Acts 22:9

And those who were with me saw the light, to be sure,  
but did not understand the voice of the One who was speaking to me.

## Acts 22:10

And I said, ‘What shall I do, Lord?’  
And the Lord said to me, ‘Get up and go into Damascus,  
and there you will be told of everything that has been appointed for you to do.’

## Acts 22:11

But since I could not see because of the brightness of that light,  
I was led by the hand by those who were with me and came into Damascus.

## Acts 22:12

Now a man named Ananias, a devout man according to the Law,  
and well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there,

## Acts 22:13

came to me, and standing nearby, said to me, ‘Brother Saul, receive your sight!’  
And at that very moment I looked up at him.

## Acts 22:14

And he said,  
‘The God of our fathers has appointed you to know His will and to see the Righteous One,  
and to hear a message from His mouth.

## Acts 22:15

For you will be a witness for Him to all people of what you have seen and heard.

## Acts 22:16

Now why do you delay? Get up and be baptised, and wash away your sins by calling on His name.’

## Acts 22:17

It happened when I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple,  
that I fell into a trance,

## Acts 22:18

and I saw Him saying to me,  
‘Hurry and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about Me.’

## Acts 22:19

And I said, ‘Lord, they themselves understand that in one synagogue after another  
I used to imprison and beat those who believed in You.

## Acts 22:20

And when the blood of Your witness Stephen was being shed,  
I also was standing nearby and approving, and watching over the cloaks of those who were killing him.’

## Acts 22:21

And He said to me, ‘Go! For I will send you far away to the Gentiles.’”

## Acts 22:22

They listened to him up to this statement, and then they raised their voices and said,  
“Away with such a man from the earth, for he should not be allowed to live!”

## Acts 22:23

And as they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and tossing dust into the air,

## Acts 22:24

the commander ordered that he be brought into the barracks,  
stating that he was to be interrogated by whipping so that he would find out the reason  
why they were shouting against him that way.

## Acts 22:25

But when they stretched him out with straps,  
Paul said to the centurion who was standing by,  
“Is it lawful for you to whip a man who is a Roman and uncondemned?”

## Acts 22:26

When the centurion heard this, he went to the commander and told him, saying,  
“What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman.”

## Acts 22:27

The commander came and said to him,  
“Tell me, are you a Roman?”  
And he said, “Yes.”

## Acts 22:28

The commander answered, “I acquired this citizenship for a large sum of money.”  
And Paul said, “But I was actually born a citizen.”

## Acts 22:29

Therefore, those who were about to interrogate him immediately backed away from him;  
and the commander also was afraid when he found out that he was a Roman,  
and because he had put him in chains.

## Acts 22:30

Now on the next day, wanting to know for certain why Paul had been accused by the Jews,  
he released him and ordered the chief priests and all the Council to assemble,  
and he brought Paul down and had him stand before them.
