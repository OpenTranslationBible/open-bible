# Acts Chapter 22

## Acts 22:1

“Brothers and fathers, hear my defence which I now offer to you.”

## Acts 22:2

When they heard him speaking to them in the Hebrew dialect, they became even more quiet; and he said:

## Acts 22:3

“I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city. I was educated under Gamaliel, strictly according to the law of our ancestors, being zealous for God just as you all are today.

## Acts 22:4

I pursued this Way relentlessly, binding and putting both men and women into prisons,

## Acts 22:5

as the high priest and all the Council of the elders can testify. I also received letters from them to their associates in Damascus, and went there to bring even those who were there to Jerusalem as prisoners to be punished.

## Acts 22:6

“But as I was on my journey, nearing Damascus around noon, a very bright light from heaven suddenly surrounded me,

## Acts 22:7

and I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?’

## Acts 22:8

And I answered, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ And he said to me, ‘I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting.’

## Acts 22:9

Those who were with me saw the light, but did not understand the voice of the one who was speaking to me.

## Acts 22:10

And I said, ‘What shall I do, Lord?’ And the Lord said to me, ‘Get up and go into Damascus, and there you will be told all that has been appointed for you to do.’

## Acts 22:11

Since I could not see because of the brightness of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me into Damascus.

## Acts 22:12

“Now a certain Ananias, a man who was devout by the law's standards and well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there,

## Acts 22:13

came to me, and standing nearby he said to me, ‘Brother Saul, receive your sight!’ And at that moment I looked up at him.

## Acts 22:14

And he said, ‘The God of our ancestors has appointed you to know his will and to see the Righteous One and to hear a message from his mouth.

## Acts 22:15

For you will testify for him to all people about what you have seen and heard.

## Acts 22:16

Now why do you delay? Get up, be baptised, and wash away your sins by calling on his name.’

## Acts 22:17

“When I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, I fell into a vision,

## Acts 22:18

and I saw him saying to me, ‘Hurry and leave Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about me.’

## Acts 22:19

And I said, ‘Lord, they themselves know that in one synagogue after another I used to imprison and beat those who believed in you.

## Acts 22:20

And when the blood of your martyr Stephen was being shed, I was there, giving my approval and watching over the garments of those who were executing him.’

## Acts 22:21

And he said to me, ‘Go! For I will send you far away to the Gentiles.’”

## Acts 22:22

They listened to him up to this point, and then they raised their voices and said, “Away with such a man from the earth, for he should not be allowed to live!”

## Acts 22:23

As they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and tossing dust into the air,

## Acts 22:24

the commander ordered that he be brought into the barracks, saying that he was to be interrogated by flogging to find out the reason why they were shouting against him that way.

## Acts 22:25

But when they stretched him out with straps, Paul said to the centurion who was standing by, “Is it lawful for you to flog a Roman citizen who has not been condemned?”

## Acts 22:26

When the centurion heard this, he approached the commander and reported, “What are you about to do? This man is a Roman citizen.”

## Acts 22:27

The commander came and asked Paul, “Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?” And he said, “Yes.”

## Acts 22:28

The commander replied, “I acquired this citizenship for a large sum of money.” And Paul said, “But I was actually born a citizen.”

## Acts 22:29

Therefore, those who were about to interrogate him immediately backed away from him; and the commander also became fearful when he realised that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had put him in chains.

## Acts 22:30

On the next day, wanting to know for certain why Paul had been accused by the Jews, he released him and ordered the chief priests and all the Council to assemble, and he brought Paul down and placed him before them.
