# Acts Chapter 8

## Acts 8:1

Now Saul approved of putting Stephen to death.  
And on that day a great persecution began against the church in Jerusalem,  
and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except for the apostles.

## Acts 8:2

Some devout men buried Stephen, and mourned loudly for him.

## Acts 8:3

But Saul began ravaging the church, entering house after house;  
and he would drag away men and women and put them in prison.

---

## Acts 8:4

Therefore, those who had been scattered went through places preaching the word.

## Acts 8:5

Philip went down to the city of Samaria and began proclaiming the Christ to them.

## Acts 8:6

The crowds were paying attention with one mind to what was being said by Philip,  
as they heard and saw the signs which he was performing.

## Acts 8:7

For in the case of many who had unclean spirits, they were coming out of them shouting with a loud voice;  
and many who had been paralysed or limping were healed.

## Acts 8:8

So there was much rejoicing in that city.

---

## Acts 8:9

Now a man named Simon had previously been practicing magic in the city  
and astonishing the people of Samaria, claiming to be someone great;

## Acts 8:10

and all the people, from small to great, were paying attention to him, saying,  
“This man is the Power of God that is called Great.”

## Acts 8:11

And they were paying attention to him because for a long time he had astounded them with his magic arts.

## Acts 8:12

But when they believed Philip as he was proclaiming the good news about the kingdom of God  
and the name of Jesus Christ, both men and women were being baptised.

## Acts 8:13

Now even Simon himself believed;  
and after being baptised, he continued on with Philip,  
and as he observed signs and great miracles taking place, he was repeatedly amazed.

---

## Acts 8:14

Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God,  
they sent them Peter and John,

## Acts 8:15

who came down and prayed for them that they would receive the Holy Spirit.

## Acts 8:16

For He had not yet fallen upon any of them; they had simply been baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus.

## Acts 8:17

Then they began laying their hands on them, and they were receiving the Holy Spirit.

## Acts 8:18

Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles’ hands,  
he offered them money,

## Acts 8:19

saying,  
“Give this authority to me as well, so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.”

## Acts 8:20

But Peter said to him,  
“May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could acquire the gift of God with money!

## Acts 8:21

You have no part or share in this matter, for your heart is not right before God.

## Acts 8:22

Therefore, repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord,  
if possible, the intention of your heart will be forgiven you.

## Acts 8:23

For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bondage of unrighteousness.”

## Acts 8:24

But Simon answered and said,  
“Pray to the Lord for me yourselves, so that nothing of what you have said may come upon me.”

---

## Acts 8:25

So, after they had solemnly testified and spoken the word of the Lord,  
they started back to Jerusalem, and were preaching the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.

---

## Acts 8:26

But an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying,  
“Get ready and go south to the road that descends from Jerusalem to Gaza.” (This is a desert road.)

## Acts 8:27

So he got ready and went; and there was an Ethiopian eunuch, a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians,  
who was in charge of all her treasure; and he had come to Jerusalem to worship,

## Acts 8:28

and he was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading Isaiah the prophet.

## Acts 8:29

Then the Spirit said to Philip, “Go up and join this chariot.”

## Acts 8:30

Philip ran up and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said,  
“Do you understand what you are reading?”

## Acts 8:31

And he said,  
“Well, how could I, unless someone guides me?”  
And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.

## Acts 8:32

Now the passage of Scripture which he was reading was this:

> “He was led like a sheep to slaughter;  
> And like a lamb that is silent before its shearer,  
> So He does not open His mouth.

## Acts 8:33

> In humiliation His justice was taken away;  
> Who will describe His generation?  
> For His life is taken away from the earth.”

## Acts 8:34

The eunuch answered Philip and said,  
“Please tell me, of whom does the prophet say this? Of himself, or of someone else?”

## Acts 8:35

Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture he preached Jesus to him.

## Acts 8:36

As they went along the road, they came to some water; and the eunuch _said_,  
“Look! Water! What prevents me from being baptised?”

## Acts 8:37

[And Philip said, “If you believe with all your heart, you may.”
And he answered and said, “I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.”]

## Acts 8:38

And he ordered that the chariot stop; and they both went down into the water, Philip as well as the eunuch,  
and he baptised him.

## Acts 8:39

When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away;  
and the eunuch no longer saw him, but went on his way rejoicing.

## Acts 8:40

But Philip found himself at Azotus, and as he passed through,  
he kept preaching the gospel to all the cities, until he came to Caesarea.
