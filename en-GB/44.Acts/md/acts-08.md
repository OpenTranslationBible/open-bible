# Acts Chapter 8

## Acts 8:1

And Saul consented to his death. On that day, a severe persecution arose against the church in Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were dispersed throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria.

## Acts 8:2

Faithful men laid Stephen to rest and mourned deeply for him.

## Acts 8:3

But Saul was making havoc of the church, entering house after house, and dragging off men and women, committing them to prison.

## Acts 8:4

Therefore, those who were scattered went about preaching the word.

## Acts 8:5

Philip went down to a city of Samaria and began proclaiming the Christ to them.

## Acts 8:6

The crowds paid close attention to what Philip said, as they heard him and saw the signs he performed.

## Acts 8:7

For many who had unclean spirits, crying out with loud voices, were coming out of them; and many who were paralysed or lame were healed.

## Acts 8:8

So as a result, there was great joy in that city.

---

## Acts 8:9

Now there was a man named Simon, who had previously practised sorcery in the city and amazed the people of Samaria, claiming that he was someone great.

## Acts 8:10

All the people, from the least to the greatest, paid attention to him, saying, “This man is the Great Power of God.”

## Acts 8:11

They followed him because he had amazed them for a long time with his magic.

## Acts 8:12

But when they believed Philip as he preached the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptised, both men and women.

## Acts 8:13

Even Simon himself believed and, after being baptised, continued with Philip. He was amazed as he observed the signs and great miracles.

---

## Acts 8:14

When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.

## Acts 8:15

When they arrived, they prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit.

## Acts 8:16

For the Holy Spirit had not yet fallen upon any of them; they had only been baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus.

## Acts 8:17

Then Peter and John laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.

## Acts 8:18

When Simon observed that the Spirit was given through the apostles' laying on of hands, he offered them money,

## Acts 8:19

saying, “Give me this authority as well, so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.”

## Acts 8:20

But Peter said to him, “May your money perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money!

## Acts 8:21

You have no share in this ministry, for your heart is not right before God.

## Acts 8:22

Therefore, repent of this wickedness of yours and pray to the Lord, that, if possible, the intention of your heart may be forgiven.

## Acts 8:23

For I see that you are filled with bitterness and held captive by sin.”

## Acts 8:24

Simon answered, “Pray to the Lord for me, so that nothing of what you have said may happen to me.”

## Acts 8:25

After they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many Samaritan villages.

---

## Acts 8:26

An angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, “Arise and go south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” (This is a desert road.)

## Acts 8:27

So he arose and went. There was an Ethiopian eunuch, a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasure. He had come to Jerusalem to worship,

## Acts 8:28

and was returning, sitting in his chariot, reading the prophet Isaiah.

## Acts 8:29

The Spirit said to Philip, “Go up and join this chariot.”

## Acts 8:30

Philip ran up and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and asked, “Do you understand what you are reading?”

## Acts 8:31

He replied, “How can I, unless someone guides me?” And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.

## Acts 8:32

Now the passage of Scripture he was reading was this:

> “He was led as a sheep to the slaughter,
> and as a lamb before its shearer is silent,
> so he does not open his mouth.

## Acts 8:33

> In his humiliation, justice was denied him.
> Who can speak of his descendants?
> For his life was taken from the earth.”

## Acts 8:34

The eunuch asked Philip, “Please tell me, of whom does the prophet say this? Of himself, or of someone else?”

## Acts 8:35

Then Philip began to speak, and starting from this Scripture, he shared the message of Jesus with him.

## Acts 8:36

As they travelled along the road, they came to some water, and the eunuch said, “Look, here is water. What prevents me from being baptised?”

## Acts 8:37

[And Philip said, “If you believe with all your heart, you may.”
And he answered and said, “I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.”]

## Acts 8:38

And he commanded the chariot to stop. Both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and Philip baptised him.

## Acts 8:39

When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord took Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him again, but went on his way rejoicing.

## Acts 8:40

Philip, however, found himself at Azotus, and as he passed through, he preached the gospel in all the towns until he reached Caesarea.
