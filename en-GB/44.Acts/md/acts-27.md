# Acts Chapter 27

## Acts 27:1

When it was determined that we should sail for Italy, Paul and some other prisoners were handed over to a centurion named Julius, who was part of the Augustan cohort.

## Acts 27:2

We embarked on a ship from Adramyttium that was set to sail to the ports along the coast of Asia, and we set out to sea, accompanied by Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica.

## Acts 27:3

The following day we arrived at Sidon; and Julius, showing kindness to Paul, allowed him to visit his friends to receive care.

## Acts 27:4

From there we set sail again and travelled under the shelter of Cyprus, as the winds were against us.

## Acts 27:5

After sailing across the sea along the coasts of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we arrived at Myra in Lycia.

## Acts 27:6

There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship bound for Italy and transferred us onto it.

## Acts 27:7

We made slow progress for many days and with difficulty reached a point off Cnidus. When the wind did not permit us to continue, we sailed under the shelter of Crete, off Salmone.

## Acts 27:8

With difficulty, we sailed along the coast and came to a place called Fair Havens, near the city of Lasea.

## Acts 27:9

After much time had been lost and sailing had become hazardous, as it was now past the Day of Atonement, Paul began to warn them,

## Acts 27:10

“Men, I perceive that this voyage will result in damage and great loss, not only to the cargo and the ship, but also to our lives.”

## Acts 27:11

However, the centurion was more convinced by the pilot and the owner of the ship than by what Paul had said.

## Acts 27:12

Since the harbour was unsuitable for wintering, the majority decided to set sail, hoping to reach Phoenix, a harbour in Crete facing southwest and northwest, to spend the winter there.

## Acts 27:13

When a gentle south wind began to blow, they thought they had obtained their goal, so they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close to the shore.

## Acts 27:14

But shortly afterwards, a fierce wind called the Northeaster swept down from the island.

## Acts 27:15

The ship was caught by the storm and unable to head into the wind, so we gave way to it and were driven along.

## Acts 27:16

As we passed under the shelter of a small island called Cauda, we were barely able to secure the ship’s boat.

## Acts 27:17

After hoisting it aboard, they used ropes to undergird the ship. Fearing they might run aground on the sandbars of Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor and let the ship be driven along.

## Acts 27:18

The next day, as we were being violently tossed by the storm, they began to throw the cargo overboard.

## Acts 27:19

On the third day, they discarded the ship’s tackle with their own hands.

## Acts 27:20

When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and the storm continued raging, we finally lost all hope of being saved.

## Acts 27:21

After they had gone a long time without food, Paul stood up among them and said, “Men, you should have followed my advice not to sail from Crete; then you would have avoided this damage and loss.

## Acts 27:22

But now I encourage you to take heart, because not one of you will be lost; only the ship will be destroyed.

## Acts 27:23

An angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve came to me during the night

## Acts 27:24

and said, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul. You must stand trial before Caesar, and God has graciously granted you the lives of all who sail with you.’

## Acts 27:25

So take heart, men, for I have faith in God that it will happen just as he told me.

## Acts 27:26

Nonetheless, we must run aground on some island.”

## Acts 27:27

On the fourteenth night, as we were being driven across the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors sensed they were approaching land.

## Acts 27:28

They took soundings and found the water to be twenty fathoms deep. A short time later, they took soundings again and found it was fifteen fathoms deep.

## Acts 27:29

Fearing that we might run aground on the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern and prayed for daylight.

## Acts 27:30

The sailors attempted to escape from the ship and had lowered the ship’s boat into the sea, pretending they were going to lay out anchors from the bow.

## Acts 27:31

Then Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, “Unless these men remain with the ship, you cannot be saved.”

## Acts 27:32

So the soldiers cut the ropes that held the ship’s boat and let it drift away.

---

## Acts 27:33

Just before dawn, Paul encouraged them all to eat. “For the last fourteen days,” he said, “you have been in constant suspense and have gone without food—you haven’t eaten anything.

## Acts 27:34

Now I urge you to take some food. It is necessary for your survival. Not one of you will lose even a single hair from your head.”

## Acts 27:35

After saying this, he took some bread and offered thanks to God in front of them all. Then he broke it and began to eat.

## Acts 27:36

They all felt encouraged and also took some food.

## Acts 27:37

In total, there were 276 of us on board.

## Acts 27:38

When they had eaten as much as they wanted, they lightened the ship by throwing the wheat into the sea.

---

## Acts 27:39

When daylight came, they did not recognise the land, but they saw a bay with a sandy beach, where they planned to run the ship aground if they could.

## Acts 27:40

Casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea and at the same time untied the ropes that held the rudders. Then they hoisted the foresail to the wind and made for the beach.

## Acts 27:41

However, the ship struck a sandbar and became grounded. The bow stuck fast and would not move, and the stern was shattered by the pounding of the surf.

## Acts 27:42

The soldiers intended to kill the prisoners to prevent any of them from swimming away and escaping.

## Acts 27:43

But the centurion, wanting to save Paul’s life, prevented them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land.

## Acts 27:44

The rest were to follow, some on planks and others on pieces of the ship. In this way, everyone reached land safely.
