# Acts Chapter 15

## Acts 15:1

Some individuals came down from Judea to Antioch and began instructing the believers, “Unless you are circumcised according to the custom taught by Moses, you cannot be saved.”

## Acts 15:2

This led to a sharp dispute and debate between Paul and Barnabas and these individuals. Consequently, Paul and Barnabas, along with some other believers, were appointed to go up to Jerusalem to consult the apostles and elders about this matter.

## Acts 15:3

The church sent them on their way, and as they travelled through Phoenicia and Samaria, they recounted in detail the conversion of the Gentiles, bringing great joy to all the believers.

## Acts 15:4

Upon their arrival in Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church, the apostles, and the elders, and they reported all that God had accomplished through them.

## Acts 15:5

However, some believers from the sect of the Pharisees stood up and declared, “The Gentiles must be circumcised and instructed to keep the law of Moses.”

---

## Acts 15:6

The apostles and elders convened to deliberate on this issue.

## Acts 15:7

After much discussion, Peter rose and addressed them: “Brothers, you know that some time ago God made a choice among you that the Gentiles might hear the message of the gospel from my lips and believe.

## Acts 15:8

God, who knows the heart, testified by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as He did to us.

## Acts 15:9

He made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith.

## Acts 15:10

So why are you testing God by placing on the necks of the disciples a yoke that neither our ancestors nor we have been able to bear?

## Acts 15:11

No, we believe it is through the grace of our Lord Jesus that we are saved, just as they are.”

---

## Acts 15:12

The entire assembly became silent as they listened to Barnabas and Paul describing the signs and wonders God had performed among the Gentiles through them.

## Acts 15:13

When they finished, James spoke up: “Brothers, listen to me.

## Acts 15:14

Simeon has explained how God first intervened to select a people for His name from among the Gentiles.

## Acts 15:15

The words of the prophets are in agreement with this, as it is written:

## Acts 15:16

> ‘After this I will return
> and rebuild David’s fallen tent.
> Its ruins I will rebuild,
> and I will restore it,

## Acts 15:17

> so that the rest of mankind may seek the Lord,
> including all the Gentiles who bear my name,’

## Acts 15:18

> says the Lord, who has made these things known from long ago.

## Acts 15:19

Therefore, it is my judgement that we should not trouble the Gentiles who are turning to God,

## Acts 15:20

but instead we should write to them, instructing them to abstain from food polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals, and from blood.

## Acts 15:21

For the law of Moses has been preached in every city from ancient times and is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath.”

## Acts 15:22

Then it seemed good to the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to choose some of their own men and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They selected Judas, called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the believers.

## Acts 15:23

They sent the following letter with them: “The apostles and elders, your brothers, to the Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia: Greetings.

## Acts 15:24

We have heard that some went out from us without our authorisation and have disturbed you, unsettling your minds by what they said.

## Acts 15:25

So we all agreed to choose some men and send them to you with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul—

## Acts 15:26

men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

## Acts 15:27

Therefore, we are sending Judas and Silas to confirm by word of mouth what we are writing.

## Acts 15:28

It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to burden you with anything beyond these essential requirements:

## Acts 15:29

You are to abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these things, you will do well. Farewell.

---

## Acts 15:30

So the men were sent off and went down to Antioch, where they gathered the church together and delivered the letter.

## Acts 15:31

The people read it and rejoiced for its encouraging message.

## Acts 15:32

Judas and Silas, who were also prophets, said much to encourage and strengthen the believers.

## Acts 15:33

After spending some time there, they were sent off by the believers with the blessing of peace to return to those who had sent them.

## Acts 15:34

[But it seemed good to Silas to remain there.]

## Acts 15:35

But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, where they, along with many others, taught and preached the word of the Lord.

---

## Acts 15:36

Some time later, Paul said to Barnabas, “Let us return and visit the believers in all the towns where we preached the word of the Lord and see how they are doing.”

## Acts 15:37

Barnabas wanted to take John, also called Mark, with them.

## Acts 15:38

But Paul did not think it wise to take him, because he had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not continued with them in the work.

## Acts 15:39

They had such a sharp disagreement that they parted company. Barnabas took Mark and sailed for Cyprus,

## Acts 15:40

but Paul chose Silas and departed, commended by the believers to the grace of the Lord.

## Acts 15:41

He travelled through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.
