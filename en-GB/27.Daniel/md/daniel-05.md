# Daniel Chapter 5

## Daniel 5:1
King Belshazzar hosted a grand feast for a thousand of his nobles, and he drank wine in their presence.

## Daniel 5:2
While tasting the wine, Belshazzar commanded to bring the gold and silver vessels that Nebuchadnezzar his father had taken from the temple in Jerusalem, so that the king, his nobles, his wives, and his concubines might drink from them.

## Daniel 5:3
Thus, they brought the gold vessels that had been taken from the temple of God in Jerusalem, and the king and his nobles, his wives, and his concubines drank from them.

## Daniel 5:4
As they drank the wine, they praised the gods of gold and silver, of bronze, iron, wood, and stone.

## Daniel 5:5
Suddenly, the fingers of a human hand appeared and began writing on the plaster of the wall, near the lampstand in the king’s palace, and the king saw the hand as it wrote.

## Daniel 5:6
The king’s face turned pale, and his thoughts alarmed him; his legs gave way and his knees knocked together.

## Daniel 5:7
The king called out to bring in the enchanters, Chaldeans, and diviners. He declared to the wise men of Babylon, “Whoever reads this writing and explains its meaning will be clothed in purple, have a gold chain around his neck, and be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom.”

## Daniel 5:8
Then all the king’s wise men came in, but they could not read the writing or explain its meaning to the king.

## Daniel 5:9
This made King Belshazzar even more terrified, and his face grew paler. His nobles were perplexed.

## Daniel 5:10
The queen, because of the words of the king and his nobles, entered the banquet hall. She said, “O king, live forever! Do not let your thoughts alarm you or your face look pale.

## Daniel 5:11
There is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods in him. In the days of your father, he was found to have illumination, insight, and wisdom like that of the gods. King Nebuchadnezzar, your father, appointed him chief of the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and diviners.

## Daniel 5:12
This was because Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar, was found to have an extraordinary spirit, knowledge, insight, the ability to interpret dreams, explain riddles, and solve difficult problems. Call for Daniel, and he will reveal the interpretation.”

## Daniel 5:13
So Daniel was brought before the king, and the king said to him, “Are you Daniel, one of the exiles from Judah, whom my father the king brought from Judah?

## Daniel 5:14
I have heard that the spirit of the gods is in you and that you have illumination, insight, and extraordinary wisdom.

## Daniel 5:15
The wise men and enchanters were brought before me to read this writing and tell me its meaning, but they could not explain it.

## Daniel 5:16
But I have heard that you can give interpretations and solve difficult problems. If you can read this writing and tell me its meaning, you will be clothed in purple, have a gold chain around your neck, and be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom.”

## Daniel 5:17
Then Daniel answered the king, “You may keep your gifts for yourself or give your rewards to someone else. Nevertheless, I will read the writing for the king and tell him its meaning.

## Daniel 5:18
O king, the Most High God granted sovereignty, greatness, glory, and majesty to Nebuchadnezzar your father.

## Daniel 5:19
Because of the greatness He gave him, all peoples, nations, and men of every language dreaded and feared him. Whomever he wished, he put to death; whomever he wished, he spared; whomever he wished, he promoted; and whomever he wished, he humbled.

## Daniel 5:20
But when his heart became arrogant and his spirit hardened with pride, he was deposed from his royal throne and stripped of his glory.

## Daniel 5:21
He was driven away from people and given the mind of an animal; he lived with the wild donkeys and ate grass like cattle; his body was drenched with the dew of heaven until he acknowledged that the Most High God is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and sets over them anyone He wishes.

## Daniel 5:22
But you, Belshazzar, his son, have not humbled your heart, though you knew all this.

## Daniel 5:23
Instead, you have set yourself against the Lord of heaven. You had the vessels from His temple brought to you, and you and your nobles, your wives, and your concubines drank wine from them. You praised the gods of silver and gold, of bronze, iron, wood, and stone, which cannot see or hear or understand. But you did not honour the God who holds in His hand your life and all your ways.

## Daniel 5:24
Therefore, He sent the hand that wrote the inscription.

## Daniel 5:25
This is the inscription that was written: Mene, Mene, Tekel, Parsin.

## Daniel 5:26
This is what these words mean: Mene: God has numbered your kingdom and brought it to an end.

## Daniel 5:27
Tekel: You have been weighed on the scales and found wanting.

## Daniel 5:28
Peres: Your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians.

## Daniel 5:29
Then, at Belshazzar’s command, Daniel was clothed in purple, a gold chain was placed around his neck, and he was proclaimed the third highest ruler in the kingdom.

## Daniel 5:30
That very night Belshazzar, the Chaldean king, was slain.

## Daniel 5:31
And Darius the Mede took over the kingdom, at the age of sixty-two.
