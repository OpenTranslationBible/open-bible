# Daniel Chapter 11

## Daniel 11:1
In the first year of Darius the Mede, I arose to support and protect him.

## Daniel 11:2
Now I will tell you the truth: Three more kings will arise in Persia, and then a fourth, who will be far richer than all of them. As soon as he becomes strong through his wealth, he will stir up the whole empire against the kingdom of Greece.

## Daniel 11:3
Then a powerful king will emerge, who will govern with significant authority and act according to his own desires.

## Daniel 11:4
After he has arisen, his kingdom will be broken and divided towards the four winds of heaven, but not to his descendants, nor with the authority he wielded, because his sovereignty will be uprooted and given to others.

## Daniel 11:5
The king of the South will grow strong, but one of his commanders will become even stronger than he and will rule his own kingdom with great power.

## Daniel 11:6
After some years, they will form an alliance. The daughter of the king of the South will go to the king of the North to make an agreement, but she will not retain her power, nor will he endure; she will be given up, along with those who brought her and her father and the one who supported her.

## Daniel 11:7
One from her family line will arise to take her place. He will attack the forces of the king of the North and enter his fortress; he will fight against them and prevail.

## Daniel 11:8
He will also seize their gods, their metal images, and their precious articles of silver and gold and carry them off to Egypt. For some years he will refrain from attacking the king of the North.

## Daniel 11:9
Then the king of the North will invade the realm of the king of the South but will return to his own land.

## Daniel 11:10
His descendants will prepare for war and gather a great army, which will advance like an unstoppable flood and carry the battle as far as his fortress.

## Daniel 11:11
Then the king of the South will march out in a rage and fight against the king of the North, who will raise a large multitude, but it will be handed over to the king of the South.

## Daniel 11:12
When the multitude is carried away, the king of the South will be filled with pride and will slaughter tens of thousands, yet he will not remain triumphant.

## Daniel 11:13
For the king of the North will muster another army, larger than the first; and after several years, he will advance with a great army and much equipment.

## Daniel 11:14
In those times many will rise against the king of the South. The violent ones among your people will rebel in fulfilment of the vision, but they will fall.

## Daniel 11:15
Then the king of the North will come and build up siege ramps and capture a well-fortified city. The forces of the South will be powerless to resist; even their best troops will not have the strength to stand.

## Daniel 11:16
The invader will do as he pleases; no one will be able to withstand him. He will establish himself in the Beautiful Land and will have the power to destroy it.

## Daniel 11:17
He will set his mind on coming with the might of his entire kingdom and will make an alliance with the king of the South. He will give him a daughter in marriage to overthrow the kingdom, but his plans will not succeed or help him.

## Daniel 11:18
Then he will turn his attention to the coastlands and will capture many of them, but a commander will put an end to his insolence and will turn his insolence back on him.

## Daniel 11:19
After this, he will turn back towards the fortresses of his own land but will stumble and fall, and will not be found.

## Daniel 11:20
His successor will send out an official to collect taxes to maintain the royal splendour. In a few years, however, he will be destroyed, yet not in anger or in battle.

## Daniel 11:21
He will be succeeded by a contemptible person who has not been given the honour of royalty. He will invade the kingdom when its people feel secure, and he will seize it through intrigue.

## Daniel 11:22
Then an overwhelming force will be swept away before him; both it and a prince of the covenant will be destroyed.

## Daniel 11:23
After an alliance is made with him, he will act deceitfully, and with only a few people he will rise to power.

## Daniel 11:24
When the richest provinces feel secure, he will invade them and will achieve what neither his fathers nor his ancestors did. He will distribute plunder, spoils, and possessions among his followers. He will plot the overthrow of fortresses—but only for a time.

## Daniel 11:25
With a large army he will muster his strength and courage against the king of the South. The king of the South will engage in battle with a large and very powerful army, but he will not be able to stand because of the plots devised against him.

## Daniel 11:26
Those who share the king’s provisions will seek to destroy him; his army will be swept away, and many will fall in battle.

## Daniel 11:27
The two kings, with their hearts bent on evil, will sit at the same table and lie to each other, but to no avail, because the end will still come at the appointed time.

## Daniel 11:28
The king of the North will return to his own country with great wealth, but his heart will be set against the holy covenant. He will take action against it and then return to his own country.

## Daniel 11:29
At the appointed time he will invade the South again, but this time the outcome will differ from what it was before.

## Daniel 11:30
Ships of the western coastlands will oppose him, and he will lose heart. Then he will turn back and vent his fury against the holy covenant. He will return and show favour to those who forsake the holy covenant.

## Daniel 11:31
His armed forces will rise up to desecrate the temple fortress and will abolish the daily sacrifice. Then they will set up the abomination that causes desolation.

## Daniel 11:32
With flattery he will corrupt those who have violated the covenant, but the people who know their God will firmly resist him.

## Daniel 11:33
Those who are wise will instruct many, though for a time they will fall by the sword or be burned or captured or plundered.

## Daniel 11:34
When they fall, they will receive a little help, and many who are not sincere will join them.

## Daniel 11:35
Some of the wise will stumble, so that they may be refined, purified and made spotless until the time of the end, for it will still come at the appointed time.

## Daniel 11:36
The king will act according to his own desires. He will exalt and magnify himself above every god and will say unheard-of things against the God of gods. He will be successful until the time of wrath is completed, for what has been determined must take place.

## Daniel 11:37
He will show no regard for the gods of his ancestors or for the one desired by women, nor will he regard any god, but will exalt himself above them all.

## Daniel 11:38
Instead of them, he will honour a god of fortresses; a god unknown to his ancestors he will honour with gold and silver, with precious stones and costly gifts.

## Daniel 11:39
He will attack the mightiest fortresses with the help of a foreign god and will greatly honour those who acknowledge him. He will make them rulers over many people and will distribute the land at a price.

## Daniel 11:40
At the time of the end the king of the South will engage him in battle, and the king of the North will storm out against him with chariots and cavalry and a great fleet of ships. He will invade many countries and sweep through them like a flood.

## Daniel 11:41
He will also invade the Beautiful Land. Many countries will fall, but Edom, Moab and the leaders of Ammon will be delivered from his hand.

## Daniel 11:42
He will extend his power over many countries; Egypt will not escape.

## Daniel 11:43
He will gain control of the treasures of gold and silver and all the riches of Egypt, with the Libyans and Cushites in submission.

## Daniel 11:44
But reports from the east and the north will alarm him, and he will set out in a great rage to destroy and annihilate many.

## Daniel 11:45
He will pitch his royal tents between the seas at the beautiful holy mountain. Yet he will come to his end, and no one will help him.
