# Daniel Chapter 12

## Daniel 12:1
“At that time Michael, the great prince who stands guard over your people, will arise. There will be a time of distress such as has never occurred since nations began until that time. But at that time your people, everyone whose name is found written in the book, will be delivered.

## Daniel 12:2
And many who sleep in the dust of the earth will awaken, some to everlasting life, others to disgrace and everlasting contempt.

## Daniel 12:3
Those who have insight will shine like the brightness of the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever.

## Daniel 12:4
But you, Daniel, keep these words secret and seal the book until the end of time. Many will roam about, and knowledge will increase.”

## Daniel 12:5
Then I, Daniel, looked, and behold, two others were standing, one on this bank of the river and the other on the opposite bank.

## Daniel 12:6
And one of them said to the man dressed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, “How long will it be until these astonishing things are fulfilled?”

## Daniel 12:7
And I heard the man dressed in linen, who was above the waters of the river, lift his right hand and his left hand toward heaven, and swear by Him who lives forever, saying, “It will be for a time, times, and half a time. When the power of the holy people has been finally broken, all these things will be completed.”

## Daniel 12:8
I heard, but I did not understand. So I said, “My lord, what will be the outcome of these events?”

## Daniel 12:9
And he said, “Go your way, Daniel, for these words are kept secret and sealed until the end time.

## Daniel 12:10
Many will be purified, cleansed, and refined, but the wicked will continue to act wickedly. None of the wicked will understand, but those who have insight will understand.

## Daniel 12:11
From the time that the regular sacrifice is abolished and the abomination that causes desolation is set up, there will be 1,290 days.

## Daniel 12:12
Blessed is the one who waits for and reaches the end of the 1,335 days.

## Daniel 12:13
But as for you, go your way until the end. You will rest, and then at the end of the days you will rise to receive your allotted inheritance.”
