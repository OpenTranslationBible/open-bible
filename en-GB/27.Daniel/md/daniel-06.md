# Daniel Chapter 6

## Daniel 6:1
It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom 120 satraps, to be in charge throughout the whole realm,

## Daniel 6:2
and over them three administrators, one of whom was Daniel, so that the satraps might be accountable to them and the king would not suffer loss.

## Daniel 6:3
Daniel distinguished himself among the administrators and satraps by his exceptional spirit, and the king planned to set him over the entire kingdom.

## Daniel 6:4
At this, the administrators and satraps sought to find grounds for charges against Daniel concerning the kingdom, but they could find no corruption or negligence in him, for he was trustworthy.

## Daniel 6:5
Finally, these men said, “We shall not find any ground for accusation against this Daniel unless it is in connection with the law of his God.”

## Daniel 6:6
So the administrators and satraps went as a group to the king and said: “May King Darius live forever!

## Daniel 6:7
The royal administrators, prefects, satraps, advisers, and governors have all agreed that the king should establish a decree and enforce an edict that anyone who prays to any god or human being except to you, O king, for thirty days, shall be cast into the lions’ den.

## Daniel 6:8
Now, O king, issue the decree and sign it so that it cannot be altered, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed.”

## Daniel 6:9
Thus, King Darius put his signature on the written decree.

## Daniel 6:10
When Daniel knew that the decree had been signed, he went to his house, where he had windows in his upper room open towards Jerusalem. He knelt down three times a day, praying and giving thanks before his God, as he had done previously.

## Daniel 6:11
Then these men came as a group and found Daniel praying and seeking favour from his God.

## Daniel 6:12
So they approached the king and spoke concerning the king’s decree: “Did you not sign an edict that any person who prays to any god or human being except to you, O king, for thirty days, shall be thrown into the lions’ den?” The king answered, “The decree stands, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be revoked.”

## Daniel 6:13
Then they said to the king, “Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no heed to you, O king, or to the decree you have signed, but continues to pray three times a day.”

## Daniel 6:14
When the king heard this, he was greatly distressed and set his mind to rescue Daniel; he laboured until sunset to deliver him.

## Daniel 6:15
Then these men came as a group to the king and said, “Remember, O king, that according to the law of the Medes and Persians, no decree or edict which the king establishes can be changed.”

## Daniel 6:16
So the king gave the order, and Daniel was brought and cast into the lions’ den. The king said to Daniel, “May your God, whom you serve continually, deliver you!”

## Daniel 6:17
A stone was brought and laid over the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet and with the signets of his nobles, so that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel.

## Daniel 6:18
Then the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting; no diversions were brought to him, and sleep fled from him.

## Daniel 6:19
At the break of day, the king arose and went in haste to the lions’ den.

## Daniel 6:20
When he came near the den, he cried out with a voice of anguish, “Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to rescue you from the lions?”

## Daniel 6:21
Then Daniel spoke to the king, “O king, live forever!

## Daniel 6:22
My God sent His angel and shut the lions’ mouths, so they have not harmed me, because I was found innocent before Him; nor have I done any wrong before you, O king.”

## Daniel 6:23
The king was exceedingly glad and commanded that Daniel be lifted out of the den. And no injury was found on him, because he had trusted in his God.

## Daniel 6:24
At the king’s command, those men who had maliciously accused Daniel were brought and cast into the lions’ den, along with their children and wives; and before they reached the bottom of the den, the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones.

## Daniel 6:25
Then King Darius wrote to all peoples, nations, and languages that dwell in all the earth: “May your peace be multiplied!

## Daniel 6:26
I make a decree that in every dominion of my kingdom, people must tremble and fear before the God of Daniel. For He is the living God, enduring forever; His kingdom shall not be destroyed, and His dominion shall be without end.

## Daniel 6:27
He delivers and rescues, He works signs and wonders in heaven and on earth, He who has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.”

## Daniel 6:28
So Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
