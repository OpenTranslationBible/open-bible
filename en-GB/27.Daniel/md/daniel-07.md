# Daniel Chapter 7

## Daniel 7:1
In the first year of Belshazzar, king of Babylon, Daniel experienced a dream and visions in his mind as he lay on his bed. He recorded the essence of his dream.

## Daniel 7:2
Daniel declared, “In my night vision, I saw the four winds of heaven stirring up the great sea.

## Daniel 7:3
Four mighty beasts emerged from the sea, each distinct from the others.

## Daniel 7:4
The first beast was like a lion and had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were removed, and it was lifted from the ground to stand on two feet like a man, and it was given a human mind.

## Daniel 7:5
Then I saw a second beast, resembling a bear. It was raised on one side, and it held three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. It was commanded, ‘Arise, consume much flesh!’

## Daniel 7:6
After this, I continued watching, and there was another beast, like a leopard, with four wings like those of a bird on its back. This beast had four heads, and it was granted dominion.

## Daniel 7:7
In my night vision, I then saw a fourth beast, dreadful, terrifying, and exceedingly strong. It had large iron teeth, and it devoured, crushed, and trampled whatever remained. It was different from all the previous beasts, and it had ten horns.

## Daniel 7:8
While contemplating the horns, another smaller horn emerged among them, and three of the earlier horns were uprooted before it. This horn had eyes like human eyes and a mouth speaking arrogantly.

## Daniel 7:9
As I watched, thrones were established, and the Ancient of Days took His seat. His clothing was white as snow, and the hair of His head was like pure wool. His throne was ablaze with flames, and its wheels were burning fire.

## Daniel 7:10
A river of fire flowed out from before Him. Thousands upon thousands served Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him. The court sat in judgement, and the books were opened.

## Daniel 7:11
I continued to observe because of the arrogant words the horn was speaking. I watched until the beast was slain, and its body destroyed and thrown into the blazing fire.

## Daniel 7:12
As for the other beasts, their dominion was removed, yet they were allowed to live for a certain period of time.

## Daniel 7:13
In my night vision, I saw one like a son of man coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was presented before Him.

## Daniel 7:14
He was given dominion, glory, and a kingdom, so that all peoples, nations, and languages might serve Him. His dominion is everlasting and will not pass away, and His kingdom will never be destroyed.

## Daniel 7:15
I, Daniel, was troubled in spirit, and the visions in my mind alarmed me.

## Daniel 7:16
I approached one of those standing by and asked for the interpretation of all this. He explained and made known to me the interpretation of these matters:

## Daniel 7:17
‘The four great beasts are four kings that will arise from the earth.

## Daniel 7:18
But the holy ones of the Most High will receive the kingdom and will possess it forever—indeed, forever and ever.’

## Daniel 7:19
Then I desired to understand the meaning of the fourth beast, which was different from all the others and exceedingly dreadful, with its iron teeth and bronze claws, which devoured, crushed, and trampled what was left with its feet.

## Daniel 7:20
I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and the other horn that came up, before which three fell—the horn that had eyes and a mouth speaking arrogantly, and which appeared more imposing than the others.

## Daniel 7:21
As I watched, this horn was waging war against the holy ones and prevailing against them,

## Daniel 7:22
until the Ancient of Days came and judgement was rendered in favour of the holy ones of the Most High, and the time arrived for them to possess the kingdom.

## Daniel 7:23
He gave me this explanation: ‘The fourth beast will be a fourth kingdom on the earth, different from all other kingdoms, and it will devour the whole earth, trampling it down and crushing it.

## Daniel 7:24
The ten horns are ten kings who will arise from this kingdom. Another king will arise after them, different from the previous ones, and he will subdue three kings.

## Daniel 7:25
He will speak against the Most High and oppress His holy ones, and will intend to change the set times and laws. The holy ones will be delivered into his hand for a time, times, and half a time.

## Daniel 7:26
But the court will sit in judgement, and his dominion will be taken away, annihilated and destroyed forever.

## Daniel 7:27
Then the sovereignty, dominion, and greatness of all the kingdoms under heaven will be given to the people of the holy ones of the Most High. His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom, and all rulers will serve and obey Him.’

## Daniel 7:28
This is the conclusion of the matter. I, Daniel, was greatly troubled by my thoughts, and my face turned pale, but I kept the matter to myself.
