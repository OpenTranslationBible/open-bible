# Daniel Chapter 8

## Daniel 8:1
In the third year of King Belshazzar's reign, a vision appeared to me, Daniel, following the one that had previously appeared to me.

## Daniel 8:2
In my vision, I found myself in the citadel of Susa, in the province of Elam, and I was beside the Ulai Canal.

## Daniel 8:3
I lifted my eyes and saw a ram with two horns standing by the canal. The horns were long, but one was longer than the other, and the longer one grew later.

## Daniel 8:4
I watched the ram charging westward, northward, and southward. No beast could withstand it, and none could rescue from its power. It did as it wished and became great.

## Daniel 8:5
As I was considering this, suddenly a goat with a conspicuous horn between its eyes came from the west, crossing the whole earth without touching the ground.

## Daniel 8:6
It approached the two-horned ram I had seen standing beside the canal and attacked it with furious power.

## Daniel 8:7
I saw it strike the ram, breaking its two horns. The ram was powerless to stand against it; the goat hurled it to the ground and trampled on it, with no one to rescue the ram from its power.

## Daniel 8:8
The goat became exceedingly great, but when it was at the height of its power, the large horn was broken, and in its place, four prominent horns grew toward the four winds of heaven.

## Daniel 8:9
Out of one of them came a small horn, which grew exceedingly great toward the south, the east, and the Beautiful Land.

## Daniel 8:10
It grew up to the host of heaven, and it cast some of the stars down to the earth and trampled them.

## Daniel 8:11
It exalted itself to be as great as the commander of the Lord's army; it removed the daily sacrifice from the Lord, and His sanctuary was overthrown.

## Daniel 8:12
Because of rebellion, the host and the daily sacrifice were given over to it. It cast truth to the ground and succeeded in what it did.

## Daniel 8:13
Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one asked, “How long will the vision last concerning the daily sacrifice, the desolation caused by rebellion, and the trampling of the sanctuary and the host?”

## Daniel 8:14
He said to me, “It will last for 2,300 evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary will be restored.”

## Daniel 8:15
As I, Daniel, was watching the vision and seeking to understand it, there stood before me one who appeared like a man.

## Daniel 8:16
And I heard a man's voice from the Ulai, calling, “Gabriel, explain the vision to this man.”

## Daniel 8:17
As he approached where I was standing, I was terrified and fell on my face. He said to me, “Understand, son of man, that the vision pertains to the time of the end.”

## Daniel 8:18
While he was speaking to me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face to the ground, but he touched me and made me stand upright.

## Daniel 8:19
He said, “I will inform you of what will happen in the latter time of wrath, for the vision pertains to the appointed time of the end.

## Daniel 8:20
The ram you saw with the two horns represents the kings of Media and Persia.

## Daniel 8:21
The shaggy goat is the king of Greece, and the large horn between its eyes is the first king.

## Daniel 8:22
The broken horn and the four horns that arose in its place represent four kingdoms that will emerge from his nation but will not have the same power.

## Daniel 8:23
In the latter period of their reign, when transgressors have reached their fullness, a king of fierce countenance, skilled in intrigue, will arise.

## Daniel 8:24
His power will be mighty, but not by his own strength. He will cause extraordinary destruction and succeed in whatever he does. He will destroy the mighty and the holy people.

## Daniel 8:25
Through his cunning, he will cause deceit to prosper under his hand, and he will magnify himself in his heart. When they feel secure, he will destroy many and stand against the Prince of princes. Yet he will be broken, but not by human power.

## Daniel 8:26
The vision of the evenings and mornings that has been told is true. But seal up the vision, for it pertains to many days in the future.

## Daniel 8:27
I, Daniel, was exhausted and lay sick for several days. Then I rose and went about the king's business. I was appalled by the vision; it was beyond understanding.
