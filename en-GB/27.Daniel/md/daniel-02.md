# Daniel Chapter 2

## Daniel 2:1
In the second year of King Nebuchadnezzar's reign, he had dreams that troubled his spirit, and he was unable to sleep.

## Daniel 2:2
The king commanded to summon the magicians, enchanters, sorcerers, and astrologers to tell him his dreams. They came and stood before the king.

## Daniel 2:3
He said to them, “I have had a dream that has disturbed me, and I wish to understand it.”

## Daniel 2:4
The astrologers spoke to the king in Aramaic, “O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will interpret it.”

## Daniel 2:5
The king answered the astrologers, “My decision is firm: if you do not tell me the dream and its interpretation, you shall be torn limb from limb, and your houses will become ruins.

## Daniel 2:6
But if you reveal the dream and its meaning, you shall receive gifts, rewards, and great honour from me. Therefore, tell me the dream and its interpretation.”

## Daniel 2:7
They replied again, “Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will interpret it.”

## Daniel 2:8
The king responded, “I am certain you are trying to gain time because you see that my decision is firm:

## Daniel 2:9
If you do not reveal the dream to me, there is but one decree for you. You have conspired to speak misleading and corrupt words before me until the situation changes. Therefore, tell me the dream, so I will know you can interpret it.”

## Daniel 2:10
The astrologers answered the king, “There is no one on earth who can do what the king asks. No great king or ruler has ever demanded such a thing from any magician, enchanter, or astrologer.

## Daniel 2:11
What the king asks is too difficult. No one can reveal it to the king except the gods, and they do not dwell among mortals.”

## Daniel 2:12
This response made the king so angry and furious that he ordered the execution of all the wise men of Babylon.

## Daniel 2:13
So the decree was issued to put the wise men to death, and they sought Daniel and his companions to execute them.

## Daniel 2:14
Then Daniel spoke with wisdom and discretion to Arioch, the captain of the king’s guard, who had gone out to execute the wise men of Babylon.

## Daniel 2:15
He asked Arioch, the king’s officer, “Why is the decree from the king so harsh?” Arioch explained the situation to Daniel.

## Daniel 2:16
Upon hearing this, Daniel went in to the king and requested time, so that he might interpret the dream for him.

## Daniel 2:17
Daniel returned to his house and informed his friends Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah about the matter,

## Daniel 2:18
urging them to seek mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that he and his friends might not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.

## Daniel 2:19
In a vision during the night, the mystery was made known to Daniel. Then Daniel praised the God of heaven

## Daniel 2:20
and said: “Blessed be the name of God forever and ever, for wisdom and power belong to Him.

## Daniel 2:21
He changes times and seasons; He removes kings and establishes them. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those who have understanding.

## Daniel 2:22
He uncovers profound and hidden things; He knows what is in the darkness, and light is with Him.

## Daniel 2:23
I thank and praise You, God of my ancestors: You have given me wisdom and power, and You have made known to me what we asked of You; You have made known to us the king’s matter.”

## Daniel 2:24
Then Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to execute the wise men of Babylon, and said, “Do not execute the wise men of Babylon. Take me to the king, and I will interpret his dream for him.”

## Daniel 2:25
Arioch quickly brought Daniel before the king and said, “I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who can explain the king’s dream.”

## Daniel 2:26
The king asked Daniel, who was also called Belteshazzar, “Are you able to tell me what I saw in my dream and interpret it?”

## Daniel 2:27
Daniel answered the king, “No wise man, enchanter, magician, or diviner can explain to the king the mystery he has asked about,

## Daniel 2:28
but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries. He has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in the latter days. Your dream and the visions that passed through your mind as you lay in bed are these:

## Daniel 2:29
As Your Majesty lay there, your mind turned to things to come, and the revealer of mysteries showed you what is going to happen.

## Daniel 2:30
As for me, this mystery has been revealed to me not because I have greater wisdom than anyone else alive, but so that Your Majesty may know the interpretation and understand the thoughts of your mind.

## Daniel 2:31
Your Majesty observed, and there before you stood a large statue—an enormous, dazzling statue, impressive in appearance.

## Daniel 2:32
The head of the statue was made of fine gold, its chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze,

## Daniel 2:33
its legs of iron, and its feet a combination of iron and clay.

## Daniel 2:34
While you were watching, a stone was cut out, but not by human hands. It struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and crushed them.

## Daniel 2:35
Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were broken to pieces and became like chaff on a summer threshing floor. The wind swept them away without leaving a trace. But the stone that struck the statue became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.

## Daniel 2:36
This was the dream, and now we will explain it to the king.

## Daniel 2:37
Your Majesty, you are the king of kings. The God of heaven has given you dominion, power, strength, and glory;

## Daniel 2:38
He has placed all people, the beasts of the field, and the birds of the sky under your authority. Wherever they dwell, He has made you ruler over them all. You are that head of gold.

## Daniel 2:39
Following you, another kingdom will arise, inferior to yours. Then, a third kingdom, one of bronze, will rule over the whole earth.

## Daniel 2:40
Finally, there will be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron—for iron breaks and smashes everything—and as iron crushes all things, so it will crush and break all the others.

## Daniel 2:41
Just as you saw that the feet and toes were partly of clay and partly of iron, so this will be a divided kingdom; yet it will have some of the strength of iron in it, even as you saw iron mixed with clay.

## Daniel 2:42
As the toes were partly iron and partly clay, so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly fragile.

## Daniel 2:43
And just as you saw the iron mixed with clay, so the people will be a mixture and will not remain united, any more than iron mixes with clay.

## Daniel 2:44
During the reign of those kings, the God of heaven will establish a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor will it be left to another people. It will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it will itself endure forever.

## Daniel 2:45
This is the meaning of the vision of the stone cut out of a mountain, but not by human hands—a stone that broke the iron, the bronze, the clay, the silver, and the gold to pieces. The great God has shown the king what will take place in the future. The dream is true, and its interpretation is reliable.”

## Daniel 2:46
Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell prostrate before Daniel and honoured him, and he ordered that an offering and incense be presented to him.

## Daniel 2:47
The king said to Daniel, “Truly, your God is the God of gods and the Lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries, for you were able to disclose this mystery.”

## Daniel 2:48
Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him many great gifts. He made him ruler over the entire province of Babylon and placed him in charge of all its wise men.

## Daniel 2:49
Moreover, at Daniel’s request, the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego administrators over the province of Babylon, while Daniel remained at the royal court.
