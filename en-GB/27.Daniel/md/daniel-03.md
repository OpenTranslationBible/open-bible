# Daniel Chapter 3

## Daniel 3:1
King Nebuchadnezzar constructed a golden image, sixty cubits high and six cubits wide, and erected it on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon.

## Daniel 3:2
The king then called together the satraps, the prefects, the governors, the counsellors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates, and all the provincial officials to attend the dedication of the image he had set up.

## Daniel 3:3
So the satraps, the prefects, the governors, the counsellors, the treasurers, the judges, the magistrates, and all the provincial officials gathered for the dedication of the image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up, and they stood before it.

## Daniel 3:4
The herald proclaimed loudly, “To you it is commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages,

## Daniel 3:5
that when you hear the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and all kinds of music, you are to fall down and worship the golden image that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up.

## Daniel 3:6
Whoever does not fall down and worship shall immediately be cast into a furnace of blazing fire.”

## Daniel 3:7
Therefore, as soon as all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, nations, and languages fell down and worshipped the golden image that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.

## Daniel 3:8
At that time, certain Chaldeans came forward and accused the Jews.

## Daniel 3:9
They addressed King Nebuchadnezzar, “O king, live forever!

## Daniel 3:10
You, O king, have issued a decree that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and all kinds of music must fall down and worship the golden image,

## Daniel 3:11
and whoever does not fall down and worship shall be thrown into the midst of a blazing furnace.

## Daniel 3:12
There are some Jews whom you have appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon, namely Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who pay no heed to you, O king. They do not serve your gods or worship the golden image you have set up.”

## Daniel 3:13
In furious rage, Nebuchadnezzar ordered that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego be brought before him.

## Daniel 3:14
Nebuchadnezzar said to them, “Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you do not serve my gods or worship the golden image I have set up?

## Daniel 3:15
Now, if you are ready, when you hear the sound of the horn, flute, lyre, trigon, harp, bagpipe, and all kinds of music, to fall down and worship the image I have made, very well. But if you do not worship, you shall be immediately cast into a blazing furnace. And what god will be able to deliver you from my hands?”

## Daniel 3:16
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied to the king, “O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves in this matter.

## Daniel 3:17
If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to deliver us from it, and he will deliver us from your hand, O king.

## Daniel 3:18
But even if he does not, let it be known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image you have set up.”

## Daniel 3:19
Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with fury, and the expression on his face changed towards Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He ordered the furnace to be heated seven times more than usual.

## Daniel 3:20
He commanded some of the strongest soldiers in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and throw them into the blazing furnace.

## Daniel 3:21
So these men, wearing their trousers, robes, turbans, and other garments, were bound and thrown into the blazing furnace.

## Daniel 3:22
The king’s command was so pressing and the furnace so hot that the flames of the fire killed the soldiers who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego,

## Daniel 3:23
and these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell bound into the blazing furnace.

## Daniel 3:24
Then King Nebuchadnezzar was astonished and rose up in haste. He asked his counsellors, “Did we not cast three men bound into the fire?” They answered, “Certainly, O king.”

## Daniel 3:25
He said, “Look! I see four men, unbound, walking in the midst of the fire, and they are unharmed, and the appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods.”

## Daniel 3:26
Nebuchadnezzar then approached the opening of the blazing furnace and called out, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out and come here!” So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out from the fire.

## Daniel 3:27
The satraps, prefects, governors, and king’s counsellors gathered around and saw that the fire had no effect on the bodies of these men. Not a hair of their heads was singed, their trousers were not scorched, and there was no smell of fire on them.

## Daniel 3:28
Nebuchadnezzar declared, “Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel and delivered his servants who trusted in him. They defied the king’s command and were willing to give up their lives rather than serve or worship any god except their own God.

## Daniel 3:29
Therefore I decree that any people, nation, or language that speaks anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego shall be torn limb from limb and their houses laid in ruins, for there is no other god who can save in this way.”

## Daniel 3:30
Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon.
