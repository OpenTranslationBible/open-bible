# Daniel Chapter 1

## Daniel 1:1
In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and laid siege to it.

## Daniel 1:2
And the Lord handed over Jehoiakim king of Judah to him, along with some of the items from the house of God. He brought these to the land of Shinar, to the house of his god, and placed the items in the treasury of his god.

## Daniel 1:3
Then the king commanded Ashpenaz, chief of his officials, to bring some of the sons of Israel, including those of the royal family and the nobility,

## Daniel 1:4
young men without physical defect, handsome, skilled in all wisdom, endowed with knowledge, quick to understand, and qualified to serve in the king’s palace. He was to teach them the literature and language of the Chaldeans.

## Daniel 1:5
The king assigned them a daily portion of the king’s choice food and wine. They were to be educated for three years, after which they would enter the king’s service.

## Daniel 1:6
Among these were some from the sons of Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.

## Daniel 1:7
The chief official gave them new names: to Daniel, the name Belteshazzar; to Hananiah, Shadrach; to Mishael, Meshach; and to Azariah, Abednego.

## Daniel 1:8
But Daniel resolved not to defile himself with the king’s choice food or wine, and sought permission from the chief official not to defile himself in this way.

## Daniel 1:9
Now God granted Daniel favour and compassion in the sight of the chief official.

## Daniel 1:10
The official said to Daniel, “I am afraid of my lord the king, who has assigned your food and drink. Why should he see you looking worse than the other young men your age? The king would have my head because of you.”

## Daniel 1:11
Daniel then said to the guard whom the chief official had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,

## Daniel 1:12
“Please test your servants for ten days: give us nothing but vegetables to eat and water to drink.

## Daniel 1:13
Then compare our appearance with that of the youths who eat the king’s choice food, and deal with your servants according to what you see.”

## Daniel 1:14
So he agreed to this and tested them for ten days.

## Daniel 1:15
At the end of the ten days they appeared healthier and better nourished than any of the young men who ate the king’s choice food.

## Daniel 1:16
So the guard continued to withhold their choice food and wine, and gave them vegetables instead.

## Daniel 1:17
To these four young men God gave knowledge and understanding in all kinds of literature and learning; Daniel also understood all kinds of visions and dreams.

## Daniel 1:18
At the end of the time set by the king to bring them into his service, the chief official presented them before Nebuchadnezzar.

## Daniel 1:19
The king conversed with them, and among them all, none was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; so they entered the king’s service.

## Daniel 1:20
In every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king questioned them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in his entire kingdom.

## Daniel 1:21
And Daniel remained there until the first year of King Cyrus.
