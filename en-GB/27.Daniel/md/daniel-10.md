# Daniel Chapter 10

## Daniel 10:1
In the third year of Cyrus, king of Persia, a revelation was imparted to Daniel, who was also known as Belteshazzar. The message was true and concerned a significant conflict. He comprehended the message and had insight into the vision.

## Daniel 10:2
During that period, I, Daniel, mourned for a full three weeks.

## Daniel 10:3
I refrained from consuming any rich food; neither meat nor wine entered my mouth, and I did not apply any ointments until the three weeks had passed.

## Daniel 10:4
On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I stood by the bank of the great river, the Tigris,

## Daniel 10:5
I lifted my eyes and saw a man clothed in linen, with a belt of pure gold from Uphaz around his waist.

## Daniel 10:6
His body was like topaz, his face shone like lightning, his eyes were like blazing torches, his arms and feet gleamed like polished bronze, and his voice was like the sound of a multitude.

## Daniel 10:7
I, Daniel, was the only one who saw the vision; the men with me did not see it, but a great fear fell upon them, and they fled to hide themselves.

## Daniel 10:8
Thus, I was left alone, gazing at this great vision; my strength deserted me, my complexion turned deathly pale, and I was left powerless.

## Daniel 10:9
Then I heard the sound of his words, and as I listened, I fell into a deep sleep, with my face to the ground.

## Daniel 10:10
Suddenly, a hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees.

## Daniel 10:11
He spoke to me, saying, “Daniel, you who are highly valued, pay attention to the words I am about to speak to you. Stand up, for I have now been sent to you.” When he spoke this to me, I stood up trembling.

## Daniel 10:12
He continued, “Do not fear, Daniel. From the first day you set your heart on understanding and humbled yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I have come in response to them.

## Daniel 10:13
However, the prince of the Persian kingdom opposed me for twenty-one days. Then Michael, one of the chief princes, came to assist me, for I had been detained there with the kings of Persia.

## Daniel 10:14
I have come to explain to you what will happen to your people in the days to come, for the vision pertains to a future time.”

## Daniel 10:15
As he spoke these words to me, I bowed my face to the ground and was speechless.

## Daniel 10:16
Then one resembling a human touched my lips, and I opened my mouth to speak. I said to the one standing before me, “My lord, I am overwhelmed with anguish because of the vision, and I feel very weak.

## Daniel 10:17
How can I, your servant, converse with you, my lord? My strength is gone, and I can barely breathe.”

## Daniel 10:18
Again, the one with the appearance of a man touched me and strengthened me.

## Daniel 10:19
He said, “Do not be afraid, you who are highly esteemed. Peace be with you; be strong now, be strong.” As he spoke to me, I was strengthened and said, “Let my lord speak, for you have given me strength.”

## Daniel 10:20
Then he said, “Do you understand why I have come to you? I must soon return to fight against the prince of Persia, and when I leave, the prince of Greece will come;

## Daniel 10:21
but first I will tell you what is inscribed in the Book of Truth. No one supports me against these forces except Michael, your prince.
