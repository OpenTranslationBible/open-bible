# Daniel Chapter 4

## Daniel 4:1
King Nebuchadnezzar, to all peoples, nations, and languages that dwell in all the earth: May your peace be abundant!

## Daniel 4:2
I am delighted to recount the signs and wonders that the Most High God has accomplished for me.

## Daniel 4:3
How great are His signs, and how mighty are His wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and His dominion endures from generation to generation.

## Daniel 4:4
I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my house and flourishing in my palace.

## Daniel 4:5
I had a dream that alarmed me; the visions in my mind as I lay on my bed terrified me.

## Daniel 4:6
Therefore, I issued a decree to summon all the wise men of Babylon to interpret the dream for me.

## Daniel 4:7
Then the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and diviners came in, and I related the dream to them, but they could not reveal its interpretation to me.

## Daniel 4:8
At last, Daniel came before me, whose name is Belteshazzar according to the name of my god, and in whom is a spirit of the holy gods; I told him the dream.

## Daniel 4:9
“Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians, I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you and no mystery is too difficult for you. Here is the dream that I saw; interpret it for me.

## Daniel 4:10
These were the visions I saw as I lay on my bed: I looked, and there was a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height was great.

## Daniel 4:11
The tree grew and became strong, and its height reached to the heavens, and it was visible to the ends of the earth.

## Daniel 4:12
Its leaves were beautiful, its fruit abundant, and in it was food for all. The beasts of the field found shade under it, and the birds of the heavens dwelt in its branches, and all living creatures were fed from it.

## Daniel 4:13
In the visions of my mind as I lay on my bed, I saw a watcher, a holy one, descending from heaven.

## Daniel 4:14
He proclaimed aloud and said thus: ‘Hew down the tree and cut off its branches, strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Let the beasts flee from under it and the birds from its branches.

## Daniel 4:15
Nevertheless, leave the stump with its roots in the earth, bound with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field. Let him be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his lot be with the beasts in the grass of the earth.

## Daniel 4:16
Let his mind be changed from that of a man, and let a beast’s mind be given to him, until seven times pass over him.

## Daniel 4:17
This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones, to the intent that the living may know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomsoever He will, and sets up over it the basest of men.’

## Daniel 4:18
This dream I, King Nebuchadnezzar, have seen. Now you, Belteshazzar, declare its interpretation, for all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation, but you can, for the spirit of the holy gods is in you.”

## Daniel 4:19
Then Daniel, whose name is Belteshazzar, was dismayed for a moment, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spoke and said, “Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or its interpretation trouble you.” Belteshazzar answered, “My lord, if only the dream applied to your enemies and its interpretation to your adversaries!

## Daniel 4:20
The tree that you saw, which grew and became strong, whose height reached to the heavens and was visible to all the earth,

## Daniel 4:21
whose leaves were beautiful and its fruit abundant, and in which was food for all, under which the beasts of the field dwelt and upon whose branches the birds of the heavens had their habitation—

## Daniel 4:22
it is you, O king; for you have grown and become strong. Your greatness has grown and reaches to the heavens, and your dominion to the end of the earth.

## Daniel 4:23
And inasmuch as the king saw a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven and saying, ‘Hew down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump with its roots in the earth, bound with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field; let him be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him,’

## Daniel 4:24
this is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the Most High that has come upon my lord the king:

## Daniel 4:25
You shall be driven from among men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field. You shall be made to eat grass like oxen, and you shall be wet with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over you, till you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men and gives it to whomsoever He will.

## Daniel 4:26
And inasmuch as they commanded to leave the stump of the tree with its roots, your kingdom shall be assured to you, after you come to know that Heaven rules.

## Daniel 4:27
Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you: break off your sins by practising righteousness, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; perhaps there may be a lengthening of your tranquillity.”

## Daniel 4:28
All this came upon King Nebuchadnezzar.

## Daniel 4:29
At the end of twelve months he was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon.

## Daniel 4:30
The king spoke, saying, “Is not this great Babylon, which I have built as a royal residence by my mighty power and for the honour of my majesty?”

## Daniel 4:31
While the word was in the king’s mouth, a voice fell from heaven: “King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken: the kingdom has departed from you.

## Daniel 4:32
You shall be driven from men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field. You shall eat grass like oxen, and seven times shall pass over you, until you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men and gives it to whomsoever He will.”

## Daniel 4:33
Immediately the word concerning Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled. He was driven from men and ate grass like oxen; his body was wet with the dew of heaven till his hair grew as long as eagles’ feathers and his nails like birds’ claws.

## Daniel 4:34
At the end of the days, I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted my eyes to heaven, and my understanding returned to me, and I blessed the Most High and praised and honoured Him who lives forever, for His dominion is an everlasting dominion, and His kingdom endures from generation to generation.

## Daniel 4:35
All the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing; He does according to His will in the army of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth. No one can stay His hand or say to Him, “What have You done?”

## Daniel 4:36
At the same time my reason returned to me, and for the glory of my kingdom, my honour and splendour returned to me. My counsellors and nobles sought me out, and I was restored to my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added to me.

## Daniel 4:37
Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, for all His works are truth, and His ways justice; and those who walk in pride He is able to abase.
