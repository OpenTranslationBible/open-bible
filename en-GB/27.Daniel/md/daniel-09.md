# Daniel Chapter 9

## Daniel 9:1
In the first year of Darius son of Ahasuerus, of Median descent, who was made king over the kingdom of the Chaldeans—

## Daniel 9:2
in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, discerned from the books the number of years that, according to the word of the Lord given to Jeremiah the prophet, the desolation of Jerusalem would last, namely seventy years.

## Daniel 9:3
So I turned my attention to the Lord God, seeking Him by prayer and supplication, with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes.

## Daniel 9:4
I prayed to the Lord my God and confessed: “O Lord, the great and awesome God, who keeps His covenant of love with those who love Him and keep His commandments,

## Daniel 9:5
we have sinned and done wrong. We have acted wickedly and rebelled, turning aside from Your commandments and ordinances.

## Daniel 9:6
We have not listened to Your servants the prophets, who spoke in Your name to our kings, our leaders, our ancestors, and all the people of the land.

## Daniel 9:7
“Righteousness belongs to You, Lord, but to us belongs open shame, as it is this day—to the people of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and all Israel, those near and those far away, in all the countries where You have driven them, because of their unfaithfulness to You.

## Daniel 9:8
Open shame belongs to us, Lord, to our kings, our leaders, and our ancestors, because we have sinned against You.

## Daniel 9:9
Mercy and forgiveness are with the Lord our God, for we have rebelled against Him;

## Daniel 9:10
and we have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in His teachings set before us through His servants the prophets.

## Daniel 9:11
Indeed, all Israel has transgressed Your law and turned aside, refusing to obey Your voice. Therefore the curses and sworn judgments written in the Law of Moses, the servant of God, have been poured out on us, because we have sinned against Him.

## Daniel 9:12
He has confirmed His words, which He spoke against us and against our rulers, by bringing upon us great disaster; for under the whole heaven nothing has been done like what has been done to Jerusalem.

## Daniel 9:13
As it is written in the Law of Moses, all this disaster has come upon us, yet we have not sought the favour of the Lord our God by turning from our sins and giving attention to Your truth.

## Daniel 9:14
Therefore the Lord has kept the disaster in store and brought it upon us, for the Lord our God is righteous in all His deeds, yet we have not obeyed His voice.

## Daniel 9:15
“And now, Lord our God, who brought Your people out of Egypt with a mighty hand and made for Yourself a name that endures to this day, we have sinned, we have acted wickedly.

## Daniel 9:16
Lord, in accordance with all Your righteous acts, let Your anger and Your wrath turn away from Your city Jerusalem, Your holy mountain. Because of our sins and the iniquities of our ancestors, Jerusalem and Your people have become a byword among all those around us.

## Daniel 9:17
“So now, our God, hear the prayer of Your servant and his supplications, and for Your sake, Lord, let Your face shine upon Your desolate sanctuary.

## Daniel 9:18
Incline Your ear, my God, and hear; open Your eyes and see the desolations of the city that bears Your name. We do not present our pleas before You because of our own righteousness, but because of Your great compassion.

## Daniel 9:19
Lord, hear! Lord, forgive! Lord, listen and act! For Your own sake, my God, do not delay, because Your city and Your people bear Your name.”

## Daniel 9:20
While I was speaking and praying, confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my plea before the Lord my God for the holy mountain of my God—

## Daniel 9:21
while I was still speaking in prayer, Gabriel, the man I had seen in the earlier vision, came to me swiftly at the time of the evening offering.

## Daniel 9:22
He gave me instruction and said, “Daniel, I have now come to provide you with insight and understanding.

## Daniel 9:23
At the beginning of your supplications, a command was issued, and I have come to tell you, for you are highly esteemed. Therefore, consider the message and gain understanding of the vision:

## Daniel 9:24
“Seventy ‘sevens’ have been decreed for your people and your holy city to finish transgression, to put an end to sin, to atone for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the Most Holy Place.

## Daniel 9:25
Know and understand this: From the issuing of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the Anointed One, the ruler, comes, there will be seven ‘sevens’ and sixty-two ‘sevens.’ It will be rebuilt with streets and a trench, but in times of trouble.

## Daniel 9:26
After the sixty-two ‘sevens,’ the Anointed One will be cut off and will have nothing. The people of the ruler who is to come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end will come with a flood; war will continue until the end, and desolations have been decreed.

## Daniel 9:27
He will make a firm agreement with many for one ‘seven.’ In the middle of the ‘seven,’ he will bring an end to sacrifice and offering. And at the temple, he will establish an abomination that causes desolation, until the end that is decreed is poured out on him.
