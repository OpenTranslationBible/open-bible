# Ezekiel Chapter 24

## Ezekiel 24:1

In the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth day, a message from the Lord reached me:

## Ezekiel 24:2

“Son of man, write down the name of this day, this very day, for the king of Babylon has begun his siege against Jerusalem this very day.

## Ezekiel 24:3

Speak a parable to this rebellious house and say to them: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says:

> “Set the pot on the fire, put it on,
> and pour water into it.

## Ezekiel 24:4

> Place into it the pieces of meat,
> every good piece—
> the thigh and the shoulder.
> Fill it with the best bones;

## Ezekiel 24:5

> select the choicest of the flock.
> Pile wood beneath it;
> make it boil well,
> and let the bones be cooked in it.

## Ezekiel 24:6

‘For thus says the Sovereign Lord:

> “Woe to the city of bloodshed,
> to the pot now encrusted,
> whose filth will not depart!
> Remove the meat piece by piece,
> without selecting it.

## Ezekiel 24:7

> For her blood remains within her;
> she exposed it on the bare rock;
> she did not pour it on the ground
> to cover it with dust.

## Ezekiel 24:8

> To arouse my wrath and take vengeance,
> I have placed her blood on the bare rock,
> so it will not be covered.

## Ezekiel 24:9

> Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says:

> “Woe to the city of bloodshed!
> I will make the wood pile great.

## Ezekiel 24:10

> Heap on the wood,
> kindle the fire,
> cook the meat thoroughly,
> mix in the spices,
> and let the bones be charred.

## Ezekiel 24:11

> Then set the empty pot on the coals
> so it becomes hot and its copper glows,
> that its impurities may melt
> and its filth be consumed.

## Ezekiel 24:12

> It has wearied me with its efforts;
> its heavy filth has not been removed,
> not even by fire.

## Ezekiel 24:13

Your impurity is lewdness. Because I sought to cleanse you, but you would not be cleansed from your impurity, you will not be clean again until my fury against you is spent.

## Ezekiel 24:14

I, the Lord, have spoken. The time has come for me to act. I will not hold back; I will not have pity, nor will I relent. You will be judged according to your ways and your deeds, declares the Sovereign Lord.’”

## Ezekiel 24:15

Another message from the Lord reached me:

## Ezekiel 24:16

“Son of man, behold, I am about to take away from you the delight of your eyes with a single blow; yet you shall not mourn or weep, nor shall your tears flow.

## Ezekiel 24:17

Groan silently; do not mourn for the dead. Keep your turban fastened and your sandals on your feet; do not cover your moustache and beard or eat the bread of mourners.”

## Ezekiel 24:18

So I spoke to the people in the morning, and in the evening my wife died. The next morning I did as I was commanded.

## Ezekiel 24:19

Then the people asked me, “Will you not tell us what these things mean for us, that you are doing?”

## Ezekiel 24:20

So I explained to them, “A message from the Lord reached me:

## Ezekiel 24:21

Say to the house of Israel, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I am about to desecrate my sanctuary—the pride of your power, the delight of your eyes, the longing of your soul. The sons and daughters you left behind will fall by the sword.

## Ezekiel 24:22

And you will do as I have done. You will not cover your moustache and beard or eat the bread of mourners.

## Ezekiel 24:23

You will keep your turbans on your heads and your sandals on your feet. You will not mourn or weep but will waste away because of your iniquities and groan among yourselves.

## Ezekiel 24:24

Ezekiel will serve as a sign to you; you will act just as he has acted. When this occurs, you will recognise that I am the Sovereign Lord.’

## Ezekiel 24:25

“As for you, son of man, on the day I take away from them their stronghold, the joy of their splendour, the delight of their eyes, their heart’s desire, and their sons and daughters as well—

## Ezekiel 24:26

on that day, a fugitive will come to you to report the news.

## Ezekiel 24:27

On that day, your mouth will be opened to the one who escapes, and you will speak and no longer be silent. Thus, you will be a sign to them, and they will know that I am the Lord.”
