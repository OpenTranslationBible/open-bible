# Ezekiel Chapter 22

## Ezekiel 22:1

Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying,

## Ezekiel 22:2

“And you, son of man, will you judge, will you judge the bloody city? Then make her abominations known to her.

## Ezekiel 22:3

And you shall say, ‘This is what the Lord God says: A city shedding blood in her midst, so that her time will come, and that makes idols to defile herself!

## Ezekiel 22:4

You have become guilty by the blood which you have shed, and defiled by your idols which you have made. So you have brought your days near and have come to your years; therefore I have made you a disgrace to the nations and a mocking to all the lands.

## Ezekiel 22:5

Those who are near and those who are far from you will mock you, you of ill repute, full of turmoil.

## Ezekiel 22:6

Behold, the leaders of Israel, each according to his power, have been among you for the purpose of shedding blood.

## Ezekiel 22:7

They have treated father and mother with contempt among you. They have oppressed the stranger in your midst, the orphan and the widow they have wronged among you.

## Ezekiel 22:8

You have despised My holy things and profaned My Sabbaths.

## Ezekiel 22:9

Slanderous men have been among you for the purpose of shedding blood, and among you they have eaten at the mountain shrines. In your midst they have committed lewdness.

## Ezekiel 22:10

They have uncovered their father’s nakedness among you; they have violated her who is unclean in her menstrual impurity.

## Ezekiel 22:11

One has committed abomination with his neighbour’s wife, another has defiled his daughter-in-law lewdly, and another among you has violated his sister, his father’s daughter.

## Ezekiel 22:12

They have taken bribes among you to shed blood; you have taken interest and profit, and you have injured your neighbours by oppression, and you have forgotten Me,” declares the Lord God.

## Ezekiel 22:13

“Now behold, I strike with My hand your profit which you have made and the bloodshed which is among you.

## Ezekiel 22:14

Can your heart endure, or can your hands remain strong in the days that I will deal with you? I, the Lord, have spoken and will act.

## Ezekiel 22:15

I will scatter you among the nations and disperse you among the lands, and I will purge your uncleanness from you.

## Ezekiel 22:16

And you will defile yourself in the sight of the nations, and you will know that I am the Lord.”

## Ezekiel 22:17

And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,

## Ezekiel 22:18

“Son of man, the house of Israel has become waste to Me; all of them are bronze, tin, iron, and lead in the furnace; they are the dross of silver.

## Ezekiel 22:19

Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: ‘Because all of you have become waste, behold, I am going to gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.

## Ezekiel 22:20

As they gather silver, bronze, iron, lead, and tin into the furnace to blow fire on it in order to melt it, so I will gather you in My anger and in My wrath, and I will place you there and melt you.

## Ezekiel 22:21

I will gather you and blow on you with the fire of My wrath, and you will be melted in the midst of it.

## Ezekiel 22:22

As silver is melted in a furnace, so you will be melted in the midst of it; and you will know that I, the Lord, have poured out My wrath on you.’”

## Ezekiel 22:23

And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,

## Ezekiel 22:24

“Son of man, say to her, ‘You are a land that is not clean or rained on in the day of indignation.’

## Ezekiel 22:25

There is a conspiracy of her prophets in her midst like a roaring lion tearing prey. They have devoured lives, taken treasure and precious things, and made many widows in her midst.

## Ezekiel 22:26

Her priests have done violence to My Law and have profaned My holy things; they have made no distinction between the holy and the common, and they have not taught the difference between the unclean and the clean; and they hide their eyes from My Sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.

## Ezekiel 22:27

Her leaders within her are like wolves tearing prey, shedding blood and destroying lives in order to make dishonest profit.

## Ezekiel 22:28

And her prophets have plastered with whitewash for them, seeing false visions and divining lies for them, saying, ‘This is what the Lord God says,’ when the Lord has not spoken.

## Ezekiel 22:29

The people of the land have practiced oppression and committed robbery, and they have wronged the poor and needy and have oppressed the stranger without justice.

## Ezekiel 22:30

I searched for a man among them who would build up the wall and stand in the gap before Me for the land, so that I would not destroy it; but I found no one.

## Ezekiel 22:31

So I have poured out My indignation on them; I have consumed them with the fire of My wrath; I have brought their way upon their heads,” declares the Lord God.
