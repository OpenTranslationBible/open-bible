# Ezekiel Chapter 22

## Ezekiel 22:1

The message from the Lord came to me, saying,

## Ezekiel 22:2

“Son of man, will you judge, will you judge the city of bloodshed? Then inform her of all her abominations.

## Ezekiel 22:3

And say: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: A city that brings upon herself doom by shedding blood in her midst and defiles herself with idols, contrary to her own good.

## Ezekiel 22:4

You have become guilty by the blood you have shed and defiled by the idols you have made. You have brought your days near and have come to the end of your years. Therefore, I will make you a disgrace to the nations and a laughingstock to all the lands.

## Ezekiel 22:5

Those who are near and those who are far off will mock you, you city of ill repute, full of turmoil.

## Ezekiel 22:6

“Observe how each of the princes of Israel within you uses his power to shed blood.

## Ezekiel 22:7

In you they have treated father and mother with contempt; they have oppressed the foreigner, and mistreated the fatherless and the widow.

## Ezekiel 22:8

You have despised my holy things and profaned my Sabbaths.

## Ezekiel 22:9

In you are slanderers bent on shedding blood; in you are those who eat at the mountain shrines and commit outrageous acts.

## Ezekiel 22:10

In you are those who uncover their father's nakedness; in you are those who violate women during their period, when they are ceremonially unclean.

## Ezekiel 22:11

In you one man commits abomination with his neighbour’s wife, another shamefully defiles his daughter-in-law, and another violates his sister, his own father’s daughter.

## Ezekiel 22:12

In you are people who accept bribes to commit violence; you take interest and make a profit from the poor. You extort unjust gain from your neighbours. And you have forgotten me, declares the Sovereign Lord.

## Ezekiel 22:13

“Behold, I will strike my hands together at your dishonest gain and the bloodshed in your midst.

## Ezekiel 22:14

Will your heart endure, or will your hands be strong in the days I deal with you? I, the Lord, have spoken and will act.

## Ezekiel 22:15

I will scatter you among the nations and disperse you through the lands; and I will cleanse you of your uncleanness.

## Ezekiel 22:16

When you have been defiled in the sight of the nations, you will know that I am the Lord.’”

## Ezekiel 22:17

Then the message from the Lord came to me, saying,

## Ezekiel 22:18

“Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to me; all of them are bronze, tin, iron, and lead left in the furnace. They are but the dross of silver.

## Ezekiel 22:19

Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: ‘Because you have all become dross, I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.

## Ezekiel 22:20

As silver, bronze, iron, lead, and tin are gathered into a furnace to be melted with a fiery blast, so will I gather you in my anger and wrath and put you inside the city and melt you.

## Ezekiel 22:21

I will gather you and blow on you with the fire of my wrath, and you will be melted inside her.

## Ezekiel 22:22

Just as silver is melted in a furnace, so you will be melted inside her, and you will Recognise that I, the Lord, have poured out my wrath on you.’”

## Ezekiel 22:23

Again the message from the Lord came to me, saying,

## Ezekiel 22:24

“Son of man, declare to the land, ‘You are a land that has not been cleansed or rained on in the day of wrath.’

## Ezekiel 22:25

There is a conspiracy of her princes within her like a roaring lion tearing its prey; they devour lives, take treasures and precious things, and make many widows within her.

## Ezekiel 22:26

Her priests have done violence to my law and profaned my holy things; they do not distinguish between the holy and the common; they have not taught the difference between the unclean and the clean; and they have shut their eyes to the keeping of my Sabbaths, so that I am profaned among them.

## Ezekiel 22:27

Her officials within her are like wolves tearing their prey; they shed blood and destroy lives to make dishonest gain.

## Ezekiel 22:28

Her prophets cover up these deeds for them by false visions and deceptive divinations. They claim, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says’—when the Lord has not spoken.

## Ezekiel 22:29

The people of the land engage in extortion and commit robbery; they oppress the poor and needy and mistreat the foreigner, denying them justice.

## Ezekiel 22:30

I searched for someone among them who would build up the wall and stand before me in the gap on behalf of the land so I would not have to destroy it, but I found no one.

## Ezekiel 22:31

Therefore, I will pour out my wrath on them and consume them with my fiery anger, bringing down on their own heads all they have done, declares the Sovereign Lord.”
