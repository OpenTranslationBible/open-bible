# Ezekiel Chapter 42

## Ezekiel 42:1

Then he brought me out into the outer courtyard, the way toward the north; and he brought me to the chamber which was opposite the courtyard and opposite the building toward the north.

## Ezekiel 42:2

Along the length, which was a hundred cubits, was the north door; the width was fifty cubits.

## Ezekiel 42:3

Opposite the twenty cubits which belonged to the inner courtyard, and opposite the pavement which belonged to the outer courtyard, was gallery corresponding to gallery in three stories.

## Ezekiel 42:4

And in front of the chambers was an inner passage ten cubits wide, and a way of one hundred cubits; and their doors were on the north.

## Ezekiel 42:5

Now the upper chambers were shorter, because the galleries took more space away from them than from the lower and middle ones in the building.

## Ezekiel 42:6

For they were in three stories and had no pillars like the pillars of the courtyards; for that reason the upper chambers were set back from the ground more than the lower and middle ones.

## Ezekiel 42:7

As for the outer wall by the side of the chambers, toward the outer courtyard facing the chambers, its length was fifty cubits.

## Ezekiel 42:8

For the length of the chambers which were in the outer courtyard was fifty cubits; and behold, the length of those facing the temple was a hundred cubits.

## Ezekiel 42:9

And below these chambers was the entrance on the east side, as one enters them from the outer courtyard.

## Ezekiel 42:10

In the thickness of the wall of the courtyard toward the east, facing the separate area and facing the building, there were chambers.

## Ezekiel 42:11

And a passage in front of them was like the appearance of the chambers that were on the north, corresponding in length and width, and all their entrances and arrangements were alike, with their doors.

## Ezekiel 42:12

Corresponding to the doors of the chambers which were toward the south, there was a door at the head of the passage, the passage in front of the corresponding wall toward the east, as one enters them.

## Ezekiel 42:13

Then he said to me, “The north chambers and the south chambers which are opposite the separate area, they are the holy chambers where the priests who are near to the Lord shall eat the most holy things. There they shall place the most holy things—the grain offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering—for the place is holy.

## Ezekiel 42:14

When the priests enter, then they shall not go out into the outer courtyard from the sanctuary without laying their garments in which they minister in the holy chambers; for these garments are holy. They shall put on other garments before they approach the area for the people.”

## Ezekiel 42:15

Now when he had finished measuring the inner house, he brought me out by the way of the gate which faced east and measured it all around.

## Ezekiel 42:16

He measured on the east side with the measuring rod: five hundred cubits by the measuring rod.

## Ezekiel 42:17

He measured on the north side: five hundred cubits by the measuring rod.

## Ezekiel 42:18

He measured on the south side: five hundred cubits by the measuring rod.

## Ezekiel 42:19

He turned to the west side and measured five hundred cubits by the measuring rod.

## Ezekiel 42:20

He measured it on the four sides. It had a wall all around, the length five hundred cubits and the width five hundred cubits, to divide between the holy and the profane.
