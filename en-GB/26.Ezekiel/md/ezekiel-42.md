# Ezekiel Chapter 42

## Ezekiel 42:1
Then he led me out into the outer court, towards the north, and brought me to the chambers opposite the separate area and the building on the north side.

## Ezekiel 42:2
The building was a hundred cubits long with its entrance facing north, and it was fifty cubits wide.

## Ezekiel 42:3
Facing the twenty cubits of the inner court and opposite the pavement of the outer court, gallery faced gallery on three levels.

## Ezekiel 42:4
In front of the chambers was an inner passageway ten cubits wide and a hundred cubits long, with entrances on the north.

## Ezekiel 42:5
The upper chambers were narrower than the ones below, as the galleries took more space from them than from the lower and middle levels.

## Ezekiel 42:6
The upper rooms were set back more than the lower and middle ones, as they had no pillars like the courts, making them smaller in floor space.

## Ezekiel 42:7
There was an outer wall parallel to the chambers and the outer court, extending fifty cubits in front of the chambers.

## Ezekiel 42:8
The length of the chambers facing the outer court was fifty cubits, while those facing the sanctuary were a hundred cubits long.

## Ezekiel 42:9
There was an entrance on the east side, beneath these chambers, as one entered from the outer court.

## Ezekiel 42:10
On the south side, along the length of the courtyard wall, opposite the separate area and the building, there were chambers.

## Ezekiel 42:11
The passage in front of them was similar to the chambers on the north, with the same length, width, exits, and dimensions.

## Ezekiel 42:12
The doorways of the chambers on the south corresponded to those on the north, with an entrance at the start of the passageway parallel to the wall extending eastward.

## Ezekiel 42:13
Then he said to me, “The north and south chambers facing the separate area are holy chambers where the priests who approach the Lord will eat the most holy offerings. There they will place the most holy offerings—the grain offerings, the sin offerings, and the guilt offerings—for the place is holy.

## Ezekiel 42:14
When the priests enter the holy precincts, they must not go into the outer court without leaving behind the garments in which they minister, for these are holy. They must put on other garments before approaching the places for the people.”

## Ezekiel 42:15
When he had finished measuring the inner area of the temple, he led me out through the east gate and measured the area all around.

## Ezekiel 42:16
He measured the east side with the measuring rod, and it was five hundred cubits.

## Ezekiel 42:17
He measured the north side, and it was five hundred cubits by the measuring rod.

## Ezekiel 42:18
He measured the south side, and it was five hundred cubits by the measuring rod.

## Ezekiel 42:19
He turned to the west side and measured it, and it was five hundred cubits by the measuring rod.

## Ezekiel 42:20
Thus he measured the area on all four sides. It had a wall surrounding it, five hundred cubits long and five hundred cubits wide, to separate the holy from the common.
