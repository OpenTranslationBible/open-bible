# Ezekiel Chapter 3

## Ezekiel 3:1

Then He said to me, “Son of man, eat what you find; eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.”

## Ezekiel 3:2

So I opened my mouth, and He fed me this scroll.

## Ezekiel 3:3

And He said to me, “Son of man, feed your stomach and fill your body with this scroll which I am giving you.” Then I ate it, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth.

## Ezekiel 3:4

Then He said to me, “Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak My words to them.

## Ezekiel 3:5

For you are not being sent to a people of unintelligible speech or difficult language, but to the house of Israel,

## Ezekiel 3:6

Not to many peoples of unintelligible speech or difficult language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely, if I had sent you to them, they would have listened to you.

## Ezekiel 3:7

But the house of Israel will not be willing to listen to you, since they are not willing to listen to Me; the whole house of Israel is stubborn and obstinate.

## Ezekiel 3:8

Behold, I have made your face just as hard as their faces and your forehead just as hard as their foreheads.

## Ezekiel 3:9

Like emery harder than flint I have made your forehead. Do not be afraid of them or dismayed before them, since they are a rebellious house.”

## Ezekiel 3:10

Moreover, He said to me, “Son of man, take into your heart all My words which I will speak to you and listen closely.

## Ezekiel 3:11

Go to the exiles, to the sons of your people, and speak to them and tell them, whether they listen or not, ‘This is what the Lord God says.’”

## Ezekiel 3:12

Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard a great rumbling sound behind me: “Blessed be the glory of the Lord in His place!”

## Ezekiel 3:13

And I heard the sound of the wings of the living beings touching one another, and the sound of the wheels beside them, a great rumbling sound.

## Ezekiel 3:14

So the Spirit lifted me up and took me away; and I went embittered in the rage of my spirit, and the hand of the Lord was strong upon me.

## Ezekiel 3:15

Then I came to the exiles who lived by the Chebar River at Tel-abib, and I sat there seven days where they were living, stunned among them.

## Ezekiel 3:16

Now at the end of seven days the word of the Lord came to me, saying,

## Ezekiel 3:17

“Son of man, I have appointed you as a watchman for the house of Israel. Whenever you hear a word from My mouth, warn them from Me.

## Ezekiel 3:18

When I say to the wicked, ‘You will certainly die,’ and you do not warn him or speak out to warn the wicked from his wicked way so that he may live, that wicked person shall die for his wrongdoing, but I will require his blood from your hand.

## Ezekiel 3:19

However, if you have warned the wicked and he does not turn from his wickedness or from his wicked way, he shall die for his wrongdoing, but you have saved yourself.

## Ezekiel 3:20

Again, when a righteous person turns away from his righteousness and commits sin, and I place an obstacle before him, he will die; since you have not warned him, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds shall not be remembered, but I will require his blood from your hand.

## Ezekiel 3:21

However, if you have warned the righteous person so that the righteous does not sin, and he does not sin, he shall certainly live because he took warning; and you have saved yourself.”

## Ezekiel 3:22

The hand of the Lord was on me there, and He said to me, “Arise, go out to the plain, and there I will speak to you.”

## Ezekiel 3:23

So I got up and went out to the plain; and behold, the glory of the Lord was standing there, like the glory which I saw by the Chebar River, and I fell on my face.

## Ezekiel 3:24

But the Spirit entered me and made me stand on my feet, and He spoke with me and said to me, “Go, shut yourself inside your house.

## Ezekiel 3:25

Now as for you, son of man, they will put ropes on you and bind you with them so that you cannot go out among them.

## Ezekiel 3:26

Moreover, I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be mute and cannot be a rebuker to them, since they are a rebellious house.

## Ezekiel 3:27

But when I speak to you, I will open your mouth and you shall say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says.’ The one who hears, let him hear; and the one who refuses, let him refuse; for they are a rebellious house.
