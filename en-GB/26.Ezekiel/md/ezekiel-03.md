# Ezekiel Chapter 3

## Ezekiel 3:1
Then He said to me, “Son of man, consume what you find here; eat this scroll, and then go and speak to the house of Israel.”

## Ezekiel 3:2
So I opened my mouth, and He gave me the scroll to consume.

## Ezekiel 3:3
And He said to me, “Son of man, fill your stomach and your body with this scroll I am giving you.” So I ate it, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth.

## Ezekiel 3:4
Then He said to me, “Son of man, go to the house of Israel and deliver My words to them.

## Ezekiel 3:5
For you are not being sent to a people of incomprehensible speech or difficult language, but to the house of Israel—

## Ezekiel 3:6
not to many peoples of incomprehensible speech or difficult language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely, if I had sent you to them, they would have listened to you.

## Ezekiel 3:7
But the house of Israel will not be willing to listen to you, for they are not willing to listen to Me; all the Israelites are stubborn and obstinate.

## Ezekiel 3:8
See, I have made your face as unyielding as theirs, and your forehead as unyielding as theirs.

## Ezekiel 3:9
Like the hardest stone, harder than flint, I have made your forehead. Do not be afraid of them or be dismayed by them, though they are a rebellious house.”

## Ezekiel 3:10
Moreover, He said to me, “Son of man, take into your heart all the words I shall speak to you and listen attentively.

## Ezekiel 3:11
Go now to your people in exile and speak to them. Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says,’ whether they listen or not.”

## Ezekiel 3:12
Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard a great rumbling sound behind me: “May the glory of the Lord be praised from His place!”

## Ezekiel 3:13
It was the sound of the wings of the living creatures touching one another and the sound of the wheels beside them, a great rumbling sound.

## Ezekiel 3:14
So the Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness and in the anger of my spirit, with the strong hand of the Lord upon me.

## Ezekiel 3:15
I came to the exiles who lived by the Kebar River at Tel-abib, and I sat among them for seven days, deeply distressed.

## Ezekiel 3:16
After seven days, the word of the Lord came to me, saying,

## Ezekiel 3:17
“Son of man, I have appointed you as a watchman for the house of Israel; so hear the word I speak and give them warning from Me.

## Ezekiel 3:18
When I declare to a wicked person, ‘You are destined to die,’ and you do not warn them or speak out to turn them from their evil ways to save their life, that wicked person will die for their sin, and I will hold you accountable for their blood.

## Ezekiel 3:19
But if you do warn the wicked person and they do not turn from their wickedness or from their evil ways, they will die for their sin; yet you will have rescued yourself.

## Ezekiel 3:20
Again, when a righteous person turns from their righteousness and does evil, and I place an obstacle before them, they will die. Since you did not warn them, they will die for their sin, and their righteous deeds will not be remembered, but I will hold you accountable for their blood.

## Ezekiel 3:21
However, if you do warn the righteous person not to sin and they do not sin, they will surely live because they took warning, and you will have saved yourself.”

## Ezekiel 3:22
Now the hand of the Lord was upon me there, and He said to me, “Get up, go out to the plain, and there I will speak to you.”

## Ezekiel 3:23
So I got up and went out to the plain, and behold, the glory of the Lord was standing there, like the glory I had seen by the Kebar River, and I fell on my face.

## Ezekiel 3:24
Then the Spirit entered into me and set me on my feet. He spoke with me and said, “Go, shut yourself inside your house.

## Ezekiel 3:25
And as for you, son of man, they will bind you with ropes so that you cannot go out among the people.

## Ezekiel 3:26
Moreover, I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be silent and unable to rebuke them, for they are a rebellious house.

## Ezekiel 3:27
But when I speak to you, I will open your mouth and you shall say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says.’ Whoever will listen, let them listen, and whoever will refuse, let them refuse; for they are a rebellious house.
