# Ezekiel Chapter 32

## Ezekiel 32:1

In the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the first day of the month, the message from the Lord came to me, saying,

## Ezekiel 32:2

“Son of man, raise a lamentation over Pharaoh king of Egypt and say to him:

‘You likened yourself to a lion among the nations, yet you are like a monster in the seas; you thrash about in your rivers, muddying the waters with your feet and fouling their streams.’

## Ezekiel 32:3

This is what the Sovereign Lord says:

> ‘I will spread my net over you > with a multitude of peoples, > and they will haul you up in my net.

## Ezekiel 32:4

> I will throw you on the land > and cast you on the open field. > I will cause all the birds of the sky to settle on you, > and all the wild animals to gorge themselves on you.

## Ezekiel 32:5

> I will lay your flesh on the mountains > and fill the valleys with your remains.

## Ezekiel 32:6

> I will drench the land with your flowing blood > as far as the mountains, > and the ravines will be filled with your flesh.

## Ezekiel 32:7

> When I extinguish you, > I will cover the heavens and darken their stars; > I will cover the sun with a cloud, > and the moon will not give its light.

## Ezekiel 32:8

> All the shining lights in the heavens > I will darken over you, > and I will bring darkness over your land,’ > declares the Sovereign Lord.

## Ezekiel 32:9

> ‘I will trouble the hearts of many peoples > when I bring about your destruction among the nations, > into lands you have not known.

## Ezekiel 32:10

> I will make many peoples appalled at you, > and their kings will shudder with horror because of you > when I brandish my sword before them. > On the day of your downfall, > each of them will tremble > every moment for his life.’

## Ezekiel 32:11

For this is what the Sovereign Lord says:

> ‘The sword of the king of Babylon will come against you.

## Ezekiel 32:12

> I will cause your hordes to fall > by the swords of mighty warriors, > the most ruthless of nations. > They will shatter the pride of Egypt, > and all her hordes will be overthrown.

## Ezekiel 32:13

> I will destroy all her cattle from beside many waters, > so that neither man’s foot > nor the hoofs of animals will muddy them anymore.

## Ezekiel 32:14

> Then I will let her waters settle > and make her streams flow like oil,’ > declares the Sovereign Lord.

## Ezekiel 32:15

> ‘When I make the land of Egypt desolate > and strip it of all that fills it, > when I strike down all who dwell there, > then they will know that I am the Lord.’

## Ezekiel 32:16

This is the lament they will chant for her. The daughters of the nations will chant it; over Egypt and all her hordes they will chant it,’ declares the Sovereign Lord.

## Ezekiel 32:17

In the twelfth year, on the fifteenth day of the month, the message from the Lord came to me, saying,

## Ezekiel 32:18

“Son of man, wail for the hordes of Egypt and consign them to the earth below, her and the daughters of mighty nations, with those who go down to the pit.

## Ezekiel 32:19

Say to them, ‘Whom do you surpass in beauty? Go down and be laid with the uncircumcised.’

## Ezekiel 32:20

They will be counted among those slain by the sword. The sword is drawn; let her be taken away with all her hordes.

## Ezekiel 32:21

The mighty leaders will speak of Egypt and her allies from within the realm of the dead: ‘They have come down and lie with the uncircumcised, with those killed by the sword.’

## Ezekiel 32:22

“Assyria is there with her entire army; she is surrounded by the graves of all her slain, all who have fallen by the sword.

## Ezekiel 32:23

Their graves are deep within the pit, and her army lies around her grave. All who had spread terror in the land of the living have been slain, fallen by the sword.

## Ezekiel 32:24

“Elam is there, with all her hordes around her grave. All of them are slain, fallen by the sword. All who had spread terror in the land of the living descended uncircumcised to the earth below. They bear their shame with those who go down to the pit.

## Ezekiel 32:25

A resting place is made for her among the slain, with all her hordes around her grave. All of them are uncircumcised, killed by the sword. Because their terror had spread in the land of the living, they bear their shame with those who go down to the pit; they are laid among the slain.

## Ezekiel 32:26

“Meshech and Tubal are there, with all their hordes around their graves. All of them are uncircumcised, killed by the sword because they spread their terror in the land of the living.

## Ezekiel 32:27

But they do not lie with the fallen warriors of old, who went down to the realm of the dead with their weapons of war—their swords placed under their heads and their shields resting on their bones—though these warriors also had terrorised the land of the living.

## Ezekiel 32:28

You too, Pharaoh, will be humbled and will rest among the uncircumcised, with those slain by the sword.

## Ezekiel 32:29

“Edom is there, her kings and all her princes; despite their power, they are placed with those slain by the sword. They rest with the uncircumcised, with those who descend to the pit.

## Ezekiel 32:30

“All the princes of the north and all the Sidonians are there; they went down with the slain in disgrace despite the terror caused by their power. They rest uncircumcised with those slain by the sword and bear their shame with those who descend to the pit.

## Ezekiel 32:31

“Pharaoh will see them and he will be consoled for all his hordes that were killed by the sword, declares the Sovereign Lord.

## Ezekiel 32:32

Though I had him spread terror in the land of the living, Pharaoh and all his hordes will be laid among the uncircumcised, with those killed by the sword, declares the Sovereign Lord.
