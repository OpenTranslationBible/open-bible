# Ezekiel Chapter 19

## Ezekiel 19:1
"Raise a lamentation for the rulers of Israel

## Ezekiel 19:2
and say: 'How like a lioness was your mother among the lions! She lay down among the young lions and reared her cubs.

## Ezekiel 19:3
She brought up one of her cubs, and he became a young lion. He learned to tear prey and devoured people.

## Ezekiel 19:4
The nations heard of him, and he was caught in their trap. They led him away with hooks to the land of Egypt.

## Ezekiel 19:5
When she saw her hope was lost, her expectation gone, she took another of her cubs and made him a young lion.

## Ezekiel 19:6
He roamed among the lions; he became a young lion. He learned to tear prey and devoured people.

## Ezekiel 19:7
He demolished their fortresses and laid waste their cities. The land and all its inhabitants were appalled at his roaring.

## Ezekiel 19:8
Then the nations set against him from all around. They spread their net over him, and he was caught in their trap.

## Ezekiel 19:9
They put him in a cage with hooks and brought him to the king of Babylon, so his voice would no longer be heard on the mountains of Israel.

## Ezekiel 19:10
Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard, planted by the waters; it was fruitful and full of branches due to abundant waters.

## Ezekiel 19:11
Its branches were strong, fit for a ruler's sceptre. It towered high above the thick foliage, noticeable for its height and its many branches.

## Ezekiel 19:12
But it was uprooted in fury and thrown to the ground. The east wind dried up its fruit; its strong branches were broken and withered, and fire consumed them.

## Ezekiel 19:13
It is now situated in the wilderness, in a parched and thirsty land.

## Ezekiel 19:14
Fire has emerged from its main branch and consumed its shoots and fruit. No strong branch is left in it, fit for a ruler's sceptre.' This is a lamentation and is to be used as a lamentation.
