# Ezekiel Chapter 19

## Ezekiel 19:1

“As for you, take up a dirge for the leaders of Israel

## Ezekiel 19:2

And say, ‘What was your mother? A lioness among lions! She lay down among young lions, she raised her cubs.

## Ezekiel 19:3

When she brought up one of her cubs, he became a young lion, and he learned to tear his prey; he devoured people.

## Ezekiel 19:4

Then nations heard about him; he was caught in their trap, and they brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt.

## Ezekiel 19:5

When she saw that she waited in vain, that her hope was lost, she took another of her cubs and made him a young lion.

## Ezekiel 19:6

And he walked about among the lions, he became a young lion; he learned to tear his prey, he devoured people.

## Ezekiel 19:7

He destroyed their palaces and laid waste their cities; and the land and its fullness were appalled because of the sound of his roaring.

## Ezekiel 19:8

Then nations set against him on every side from their provinces, and they spread their net over him; he was caught in their trap.

## Ezekiel 19:9

They put him in a wooden collar with hooks and brought him to the king of Babylon; they brought him in hunting nets so that his voice would no longer be heard on the mountains of Israel.

## Ezekiel 19:10

Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard, planted by the waters; it was fruitful and full of branches because of abundant waters.

## Ezekiel 19:11

And it had strong branches fit for sceptres of rulers, and its height was raised above the clouds so that it was seen in its height with the mass of its branches.

## Ezekiel 19:12

But it was uprooted in fury; it was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up its fruit. Its strong branch was torn off so that it withered; fire consumed it.

## Ezekiel 19:13

And now it is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land.

## Ezekiel 19:14

And fire has gone out from its branch; it has consumed its shoots and fruit, so that there is no strong branch in it, a sceptre to rule.’”  
This is a dirge, and has become a dirge.
