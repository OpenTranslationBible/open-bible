# Ezekiel Chapter 10

## Ezekiel 10:1
I looked, and there appeared above the heads of the cherubim something like a throne made of sapphire stone, resembling a throne in the expanse above them.

## Ezekiel 10:2
And the Lord spoke to the man clothed in linen, saying, “Go in among the wheels beneath the cherubim, and fill your hands with burning coals from among the cherubim, and scatter them over the city.” And he went in as I watched.

## Ezekiel 10:3
The cherubim were positioned on the right side of the temple as the man entered, and the cloud filled the inner court.

## Ezekiel 10:4
Then the glory of the Lord rose from above the cherubim to the threshold of the temple. The temple was filled with the cloud, and the courtyard was filled with the brightness of the glory of the Lord.

## Ezekiel 10:5
The sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard as far as the outer courtyard, like the voice of God Almighty when He speaks.

## Ezekiel 10:6
When the Lord instructed the man in linen, “Take fire from among the wheels, from among the cherubim,” he entered and stood beside a wheel.

## Ezekiel 10:7
One of the cherubim reached out his hand to the fire among them, took some coals, and placed them into the hands of the man in linen, who took them and went out.

## Ezekiel 10:8
Under the wings of the cherubim, there appeared to be something like human hands.

## Ezekiel 10:9
I looked, and there were four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside each cherub; the wheels sparkled like a Tarshish stone.

## Ezekiel 10:10
As for their appearance, the four of them looked alike, as if one wheel were within another wheel.

## Ezekiel 10:11
As they moved, they went in any of the four directions without turning as they went; they moved in the direction they faced, without turning.

## Ezekiel 10:12
Their entire bodies, including their backs, their hands, their wings, and the wheels, were covered with eyes all around.

## Ezekiel 10:13
I heard the wheels being called “the whirling wheels.”

## Ezekiel 10:14
Each of the cherubim had four faces: the first was the face of a cherub, the second the face of a human, the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.

## Ezekiel 10:15
Then the cherubim rose upwards. These were the living creatures I had seen by the river Kebar.

## Ezekiel 10:16
When the cherubim moved, the wheels moved beside them; and when the cherubim lifted their wings to rise from the ground, the wheels stayed beside them.

## Ezekiel 10:17
When the cherubim stood still, the wheels stood still; and when they rose, the wheels rose with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in them.

## Ezekiel 10:18
Then the glory of the Lord departed from the threshold of the temple and stood above the cherubim.

## Ezekiel 10:19
While I watched, the cherubim spread their wings and rose from the ground, with the wheels beside them, and they stood at the entrance of the east gate of the Lord’s house, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them.

## Ezekiel 10:20
These were the living creatures I had seen beneath the God of Israel by the river Kebar, and I realised they were cherubim.

## Ezekiel 10:21
Each had four faces and four wings, and under their wings was the form of human hands.

## Ezekiel 10:22
Their faces were the same as those I had seen by the river Kebar. Each one moved straight ahead.
