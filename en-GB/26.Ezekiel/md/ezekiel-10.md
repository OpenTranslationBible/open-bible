# Ezekiel Chapter 10

## Ezekiel 10:1

Then I looked, and behold, in the expanse that was over the heads of the cherubim something like a sapphire stone, in appearance resembling a throne, appeared above them.

## Ezekiel 10:2

And He spoke to the man clothed in linen and said, “Enter between the whirling wheels under the cherubim and fill your hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city.” And he entered in my sight.

## Ezekiel 10:3

Now the cherubim were standing on the right side of the temple when the man entered, and the cloud filled the inner courtyard.

## Ezekiel 10:4

Then the glory of the Lord rose up from the cherub to the threshold of the temple, and the temple was filled with the cloud, and the courtyard was filled with the brightness of the glory of the Lord.

## Ezekiel 10:5

Moreover, the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard as far as the outer courtyard, like the voice of God Almighty when He speaks.

## Ezekiel 10:6

When He commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, “Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim,” he entered and stood beside a wheel.

## Ezekiel 10:7

Then the cherub stretched out his hand from between the cherubim to the fire which was between the cherubim, took some and put it into the hands of the man clothed in linen. He took it and went out.

## Ezekiel 10:8

The cherubim appeared to have the form of a human hand under their wings.

## Ezekiel 10:9

Then I looked, and behold, four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside each cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was like the gleam of a Tarshish stone.

## Ezekiel 10:10

As for their appearance, all four of them had the same form, as if one wheel were within another wheel.

## Ezekiel 10:11

When they moved, they went in any of their four directions without turning as they went; but they followed the direction in which the head was facing, without turning as they went.

## Ezekiel 10:12

And their entire body, their backs, hands, wings, and wheels were covered with eyes all around, the wheels belonging to all four of them.

## Ezekiel 10:13

The wheels were called in my hearing, the whirling wheels.

## Ezekiel 10:14

And each one had four faces. The first face was the face of a cherub, the second the face of a man, the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.

## Ezekiel 10:15

Then the cherubim rose up. They were the living beings that I saw by the Chebar River.

## Ezekiel 10:16

Now when the cherubim moved, the wheels would go beside them; also, when the cherubim lifted their wings to rise from the ground, the wheels did not turn from beside them.

## Ezekiel 10:17

When the cherubim stood still, the wheels stood still; and when they rose, the wheels rose with them, because the spirit of the living beings was in them.

## Ezekiel 10:18

Then the glory of the Lord departed from the threshold of the temple and stood over the cherubim.

## Ezekiel 10:19

When the cherubim departed, they lifted their wings and rose from the ground in my sight with the wheels beside them; and they stood at the entrance of the east gate of the Lord’s house, and the glory of the God of Israel hovered over them.

## Ezekiel 10:20

These were the living beings that I saw beneath the God of Israel by the Chebar River, so I knew that they were cherubim.

## Ezekiel 10:21

Each one had four faces and each one four wings, and under their wings was the likeness of human hands.

## Ezekiel 10:22

As for the likeness of their faces, they were the same faces whose appearance I had seen by the Chebar River. Each one went straight forward.
