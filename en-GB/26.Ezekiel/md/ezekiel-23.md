# Ezekiel Chapter 23

## Ezekiel 23:1
The word of the Lord came to me once more, saying,

## Ezekiel 23:2
“Son of man, there were two women, daughters of the same mother;

## Ezekiel 23:3
and they engaged in prostitution in Egypt. They prostituted themselves from their youth; there their breasts were fondled and their virgin bosoms were caressed.

## Ezekiel 23:4
The elder was named Oholah, and her sister was Oholibah. They belonged to me and bore sons and daughters. Oholah represents Samaria, and Oholibah represents Jerusalem.

## Ezekiel 23:5
“Oholah engaged in prostitution while she was still mine; she lusted after her lovers, the Assyrians, her neighbours,

## Ezekiel 23:6
clothed in blue, governors and commanders, all of them handsome young men, riding on horses.

## Ezekiel 23:7
She bestowed her obscene practices upon them, all the elite of the Assyrians, and defiled herself with all their idols, with whom she lusted.

## Ezekiel 23:8
She did not abandon the prostitution she began in Egypt; in her youth men slept with her, caressed her virgin bosom and poured out their lust upon her.

## Ezekiel 23:9
Therefore, I handed her over to her lovers, the Assyrians, for whom she lusted.

## Ezekiel 23:10
They uncovered her nakedness, took away her sons and daughters, and killed her with the sword. She became a byword among women, and judgments were executed upon her.

## Ezekiel 23:11
“Her sister Oholibah saw this, yet she was more depraved in her lust and prostitution than her sister.

## Ezekiel 23:12
She too lusted after the Assyrians—governors and commanders, opulently dressed, horsemen riding on horses, all handsome young men.

## Ezekiel 23:13
And I saw that she too defiled herself; both of them followed the same path.

## Ezekiel 23:14
But she carried her prostitution further. She saw men portrayed on a wall, images of Chaldeans drawn in bright red,

## Ezekiel 23:15
with belts around their waists and flowing turbans on their heads; all of them looked like Babylonian officers, natives of Chaldea.

## Ezekiel 23:16
When she saw them, she desired them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea.

## Ezekiel 23:17
Then the Babylonians came to her, and in their desire they defiled her. After she had been defiled by them, she turned away from them in disgust.

## Ezekiel 23:18
She exposed her obscene practices and her nakedness; therefore, I turned away from her in disgust, just as I had turned away from her sister.

## Ezekiel 23:19
Yet she multiplied her obscene practices, recalling the days of her youth, when she prostituted herself in Egypt.

## Ezekiel 23:20
She lusted after her lovers, whose flesh was like that of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses.

## Ezekiel 23:21
So you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when in Egypt your bosom was caressed and your young breasts fondled.

## Ezekiel 23:22
“Therefore, Oholibah, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I will incite your lovers against you, those you turned away from in disgust, and I will bring them against you from every side—

## Ezekiel 23:23
the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, the men of Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them, all of them governors and commanders, chariot officers and men of high rank, all mounted on horses.

## Ezekiel 23:24
They will come against you with weapons, chariots and wagons, and with a multitude of people; they will set themselves against you on every side with large and small shields and with helmets. I will commit judgment to them, and they will judge you according to their customs.

## Ezekiel 23:25
I will direct my jealous anger against you, and they will deal with you in wrath. They will cut off your noses and your ears, and those who remain will fall by the sword. They will take away your sons and daughters, and those who remain will be consumed by fire.

## Ezekiel 23:26
They will also take away your garments and seize your fine jewellery.

## Ezekiel 23:27
So I will put an end to your lewdness and prostitution brought from Egypt. You will not look on these things with longing or remember Egypt anymore.

## Ezekiel 23:28
For this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I am about to deliver you into the hands of those you hate, to those you turned away from in disgust.

## Ezekiel 23:29
They will deal with you in hatred, take all your possessions, and leave you naked and bare. The shame of your prostitution will be exposed, and your lewdness and obscene practices

## Ezekiel 23:30
have brought this upon you, because you lusted after the nations and defiled yourself with their idols.

## Ezekiel 23:31
You have followed the way of your sister; therefore, I will place her cup into your hand.

## Ezekiel 23:32
This is what the Sovereign Lord says: You will drink your sister’s cup, a cup deep and wide; it will bring scorn and derision, for it holds much.

## Ezekiel 23:33
You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, a cup of ruin and desolation, the cup of your sister Samaria.

## Ezekiel 23:34
You will drink it and drain it dry; you will gnaw on its fragments and tear your breasts. I have spoken, declares the Sovereign Lord.

## Ezekiel 23:35
Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: Because you have forgotten me and cast me behind your back, you must bear the consequences of your lewdness and obscene practices.”

## Ezekiel 23:36
Moreover, the Lord said to me: “Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then confront them with their detestable practices,

## Ezekiel 23:37
for they have committed adultery and blood is on their hands. They were unfaithful with their idols; they even sacrificed their children, whom they bore to me, as food for them.

## Ezekiel 23:38
They have also done this to me: At that same time, they defiled my sanctuary and desecrated my Sabbaths.

## Ezekiel 23:39
On the very day they sacrificed their children to their idols, they entered my sanctuary and desecrated it. That is what they did in my house.

## Ezekiel 23:40
Furthermore, they sent messengers for men who came from afar, and when they arrived, you bathed yourself for them, applied eye makeup and adorned yourself with jewellery.

## Ezekiel 23:41
You sat on a splendid couch, with a table spread before it on which you had placed my incense and my oil.

## Ezekiel 23:42
The noise of a carefree crowd was around her; drunkards were brought from the wilderness along with men from the rabble, and they put bracelets on the wrists of the woman and her sister and beautiful crowns on their heads.

## Ezekiel 23:43
Then I said concerning the one worn out by adultery, ‘Now let them use her as a prostitute, for that is all she is.’

## Ezekiel 23:44
And they went in to her as men go in to a prostitute. So they went in to Oholah and Oholibah, the lewd women.

## Ezekiel 23:45
But righteous judges will sentence them to the punishment of women who commit adultery and shed blood, because they are adulteresses and blood is on their hands.

## Ezekiel 23:46
For this is what the Sovereign Lord says: Bring a mob against them and give them over to terror and plunder.

## Ezekiel 23:47
The mob will stone them and cut them down with their swords; they will kill their sons and daughters and burn their houses.

## Ezekiel 23:48
Thus, I will bring an end to lewdness in the land, that all women may take warning and not imitate you.

## Ezekiel 23:49
You will bear the penalty for your lewdness and the consequences of your idolatrous acts. Then you will know that I am the Sovereign Lord.”
