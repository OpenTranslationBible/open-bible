Then he brought me back to the outer gate of the sanctuary, the one facing east; and it was closed.

Say to the rebellious house of Israel, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Enough of all your abominations, O house of Israel!

## Ezekiel 44:7

They may serve in my sanctuary, having oversight at the gates of the house and ministering in the house; they may slaughter the burnt offerings and sacrifices for the people and stand before them to minister to them.

## Ezekiel 44:12
Because they ministered to them before their idols and caused the house of Israel to fall into sin, therefore I have sworn against them, declares the Sovereign Lord, that they shall bear the punishment for their wrongdoing.

## Ezekiel 44:13
They shall not come near to serve me as priests, nor come near any of my holy things or my most holy offerings; they shall bear their shame and their abominations which they have committed.

## Ezekiel 44:14
Nevertheless, I will appoint them to take responsibility for the house, for all its service and for everything that is to be done in it.

## Ezekiel 44:15
But the Levitical priests, the descendants of Zadok, who took responsibility for my sanctuary when the Israelites went astray from me, shall come near to minister before me; they shall stand before me to offer me the fat and the blood, declares the Sovereign Lord.

They alone shall enter my sanctuary; they alone shall come near my table to minister before me and serve me.

## Ezekiel 44:18
They shall wear linen turbans on their heads and linen undergarments around their waists; they must not wear anything that makes them perspire.

## Ezekiel 44:19
When they go out into the outer court to the people, they shall take off the garments they have been ministering in and leave them in the sacred rooms, and put on other clothes, so that they do not transfer holiness to the people with their garments.
