# Ezekiel Chapter 1

## Ezekiel 1:1
In the thirtieth year, on the fifth day of the fourth month, while I was among the exiles by the River Kebar, the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.

## Ezekiel 1:2
On the fifth day of the month—it was the fifth year of King Jehoiachin's exile—

## Ezekiel 1:3
the word of the Lord came to Ezekiel the priest, son of Buzi, by the River Kebar in the land of the Chaldeans. There the hand of the Lord was upon him.

## Ezekiel 1:4
As I looked, I saw a stormy wind coming from the north, a great cloud with lightning flashing and a bright light surrounding it. In the centre of the fire was something like glowing metal.

## Ezekiel 1:5
In the fire were figures resembling four living creatures, and they had a human-like form.

## Ezekiel 1:6
Each had four faces and four wings.

## Ezekiel 1:7
Their legs were straight, and their feet were like those of a calf, shining like polished bronze.

## Ezekiel 1:8
Under their wings on their four sides were human hands. All four had faces and wings.

## Ezekiel 1:9
Their wings touched one another; they did not turn as they moved, each went straight forward.

## Ezekiel 1:10
Their faces were like this: each had a human face, a lion's face on the right, an ox's face on the left, and an eagle's face.

## Ezekiel 1:11
Such were their faces. Their wings were spread out above; each had two wings touching another creature and two covering their bodies.

## Ezekiel 1:12
Each went straight forward; wherever the spirit would go, they would go, without turning as they went.

## Ezekiel 1:13
The appearance of the living creatures was like burning coals of fire, like torches. Fire moved among the creatures, and lightning flashed from it.

## Ezekiel 1:14
The creatures darted back and forth like flashes of lightning.

## Ezekiel 1:15
As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces.

## Ezekiel 1:16
The appearance of the wheels was like sparkling topaz, and all four looked alike. They seemed to be made like a wheel within a wheel.

## Ezekiel 1:17
When they moved, they went in any of the four directions without turning as they moved.

## Ezekiel 1:18
Their rims were high and awesome, and the rims of all four were full of eyes all around.

## Ezekiel 1:19
When the living creatures moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels rose also.

## Ezekiel 1:20
Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise along with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.

## Ezekiel 1:21
When the creatures moved, the wheels moved; when they stood still, the wheels stood still; and when they rose from the ground, the wheels rose with them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.

## Ezekiel 1:22
Above the heads of the living creatures was what looked like an expanse, sparkling like crystal, spread out over their heads.

## Ezekiel 1:23
Under the expanse, their wings were stretched out straight, one toward the other; each had two wings covering its body.

## Ezekiel 1:24
When the creatures moved, I heard the sound of their wings, like the roar of rushing waters, like the voice of the Almighty, like the noise of an army. When they stood still, they lowered their wings.

## Ezekiel 1:25
Then there came a voice from above the expanse over their heads as they stood with lowered wings.

## Ezekiel 1:26
Above the expanse over their heads was something like a throne, resembling lapis lazuli, and on the throne high above was a figure like that of a man.

## Ezekiel 1:27
I saw that from what appeared to be his waist up he looked like glowing metal, as if full of fire, and from there down he looked like fire, and brilliant light surrounded him.

## Ezekiel 1:28
Like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day, so was the radiance around him. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. When I saw it, I fell facedown, and I heard the voice of one speaking.
