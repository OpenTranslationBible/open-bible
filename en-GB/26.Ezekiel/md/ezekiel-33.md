# Ezekiel Chapter 33

## Ezekiel 33:1
The word of the Lord came to me, saying:

## Ezekiel 33:2
“Son of man, speak to the sons of your people and say to them: ‘If I bring a sword upon a land, and the people of the land select one man from among them and appoint him as their watchman,

## Ezekiel 33:3
and he sees the sword coming upon the land and blows the trumpet to warn the people,

## Ezekiel 33:4
then if anyone hears the sound of the trumpet but does not take warning, and the sword comes and takes him away, his blood will be on his own head.

## Ezekiel 33:5
He heard the sound of the trumpet but did not heed the warning; his blood will be on himself. If he had heeded the warning, he would have saved his life.

## Ezekiel 33:6
But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet, and the people are not warned, and the sword comes and takes a person away, he is taken away for his wrongdoing, but I will hold the watchman accountable for his blood.’

## Ezekiel 33:7
“Now as for you, son of man, I have appointed you as a watchman for the house of Israel; so hear the word I speak and give them a warning from Me.

## Ezekiel 33:8
When I say to the wicked, ‘You wicked person, you will surely die,’ and you do not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked person shall die for his sin, but I will hold you accountable for his blood.

## Ezekiel 33:9
But if you do warn the wicked person to turn from his ways and he does not do so, he will die for his sin, but you will have saved your life.

## Ezekiel 33:10
“Now as for you, son of man, say to the house of Israel, ‘This is what you are saying: “Our offences and sins weigh us down, and we are wasting away in them. How then can we survive?”’

## Ezekiel 33:11
Say to them, ‘As I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that the wicked turn from his ways and live. Turn back, turn back from your evil ways! Why will you die, house of Israel?’

## Ezekiel 33:12
“Therefore, son of man, say to your fellow citizens, ‘The righteousness of a righteous person will not save him on the day of his offence, and as for the wickedness of a wicked person, he will not fall because of it on the day he turns from his wickedness; nor will a righteous person be able to live by his righteousness on the day he commits sin.’

## Ezekiel 33:13
When I say to the righteous that he will surely live, and he trusts in his righteousness and commits injustice, none of his righteous deeds will be remembered; he will die for the injustice he has committed.

## Ezekiel 33:14
But when I say to the wicked, ‘You will surely die,’ and he turns away from his sin and does what is just and right—

## Ezekiel 33:15
if he returns what he took in pledge for a loan, pays back what he has stolen, follows the statutes that ensure life, and does no injustice, he will surely live; he will not die.

## Ezekiel 33:16
None of the sins he has committed will be remembered against him. He has done what is just and right; he will surely live.

## Ezekiel 33:17
“Yet your fellow citizens say, ‘The way of the Lord is not right,’ when it is their own way that is not right.

## Ezekiel 33:18
When a righteous person turns from his righteousness and commits injustice, he will die for it.

## Ezekiel 33:19
But when a wicked person turns away from his wickedness and does what is just and right, he will live by doing so.

## Ezekiel 33:20
Yet you say, ‘The way of the Lord is not right.’ I will judge each of you according to your own ways, house of Israel.”

## Ezekiel 33:21
Now in the twelfth year of our exile, on the fifth day of the tenth month, a man who had escaped from Jerusalem came to me, saying, “The city has been taken.”

## Ezekiel 33:22
Now the hand of the Lord had been upon me in the evening before the man arrived, and He opened my mouth before the man came to me in the morning. So my mouth was opened and I was no longer silent.

## Ezekiel 33:23
Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying:

## Ezekiel 33:24
“Son of man, those living in the ruins in the land of Israel are saying, ‘Abraham was only one man, yet he possessed the land. But we are many; surely the land has been given to us as a possession.’

## Ezekiel 33:25
Therefore say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Since you eat meat with the blood still in it, raise your eyes to your idols and shed blood, should you then possess the land?

## Ezekiel 33:26
You rely on your sword, you commit abominations, and each of you defiles his neighbour’s wife. Should you then possess the land?’

## Ezekiel 33:27
You shall say this to them: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: As I live, those who are in the ruins will fall by the sword, and those in the open field I will give to the wild animals to be devoured, and those in strongholds and caves will die of plague.

## Ezekiel 33:28
I will make the land a desolate waste, and her proud strength will come to an end, and the mountains of Israel will be desolate so that no one will pass through.

## Ezekiel 33:29
Then they will know that I am the Lord, when I have made the land a desolate waste because of all the abominations they have committed.’

## Ezekiel 33:30
“But as for you, son of man, your fellow citizens who talk with one another about you by the walls and in the doorways of the houses, say to each other, ‘Come and hear the message that has come from the Lord.’

## Ezekiel 33:31
And they come to you as people come, and sit before you as My people and hear your words, but they do not put them into practice. Their mouths speak of love, but their hearts pursue unjust gain.

## Ezekiel 33:32
Indeed, to them you are like one who sings love songs with a beautiful voice and plays an instrument well, for they hear your words but do not put them into practice.

## Ezekiel 33:33
So when it comes to pass—as it surely will—then they will know that a prophet has been among them.”
