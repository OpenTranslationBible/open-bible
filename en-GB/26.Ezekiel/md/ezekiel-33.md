# Ezekiel Chapter 33

## Ezekiel 33:1

And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,

## Ezekiel 33:2

“Son of man, speak to the sons of your people and say to them, ‘If I bring a sword upon a land, and the people of the land take one man from among them and make him their watchman,

## Ezekiel 33:3

And he sees the sword coming upon the land and blows the horn and warns the people,

## Ezekiel 33:4

Then someone who hears the sound of the horn but does not take warning, and a sword comes and takes him away, his blood will be on his own head.

## Ezekiel 33:5

He heard the sound of the horn but did not take warning; his blood will be on himself. But had he taken warning, he would have saved his life.

## Ezekiel 33:6

But if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the horn, and the people are not warned, and a sword comes and takes a person from them, he is taken away for his wrongdoing; but I will require his blood from the watchman’s hand.’

## Ezekiel 33:7

“Now as for you, son of man, I have appointed you as a watchman for the house of Israel; so you will hear a message from My mouth and give them a warning from Me.

## Ezekiel 33:8

When I say to the wicked, ‘You will certainly die,’ and you do not speak to warn the wicked about his way, that wicked person shall die for his wrongdoing, but I will require his blood from your hand.

## Ezekiel 33:9

But if you on your part warn a wicked person to turn from his way and he does not turn from his way, he will die for his wrongdoing, but you have saved your life.

## Ezekiel 33:10

“Now as for you, son of man, say to the house of Israel, ‘This is what you have said: “Certainly our offenses and our sins are upon us, and we are rotting away in them; how then can we survive?”’

## Ezekiel 33:11

Say to them, ‘As I live!’ declares the Lord God, ‘I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that the wicked turn from his way and live. Turn back, turn back from your evil ways! Why then should you die, house of Israel?’

## Ezekiel 33:12

“Now as for you, son of man, say to your people, ‘The righteousness of a righteous one will not save him on the day of his offense, and as for the wickedness of a wicked one, he will not stumble because of it on the day when he turns from his wickedness; whereas a righteous one will not be able to live by his righteousness on the day when he commits sin.’

## Ezekiel 33:13

When I say to the righteous that he will certainly live, and he trusts in his righteousness and commits injustice, none of his righteous deeds will be remembered; but for that same injustice of his which he has committed he will die.

## Ezekiel 33:14

But when I say to the wicked, ‘You will certainly die,’ and he turns from his sin and practices justice and righteousness,

## Ezekiel 33:15

If a wicked person returns a pledge, repays what he has taken by robbery, walks by the statutes which ensure life without committing injustice, he will certainly live; he shall not die.

## Ezekiel 33:16

None of his sins that he has committed will be remembered against him. He has practiced justice and righteousness; he shall certainly live.

## Ezekiel 33:17

Yet your people say, ‘The way of the Lord is not right,’ when it is their own way that is not right.

## Ezekiel 33:18

When a righteous person turns from his righteousness and commits injustice, then he will die in it.

## Ezekiel 33:19

But when a wicked person turns from his wickedness and practices justice and righteousness, he will live by them.

## Ezekiel 33:20

Yet you say, ‘The way of the Lord is not right.’ I will judge each of you according to his ways, house of Israel.”

## Ezekiel 33:21

Now in the twelfth year of our exile, on the fifth of the tenth month, the refugees from Jerusalem came to me, saying, “The city has been taken.”

## Ezekiel 33:22

Now the hand of the Lord had been upon me in the evening, before the refugees came. And He opened my mouth at the time they came to me in the morning; so my mouth was opened, and I was no longer speechless.

## Ezekiel 33:23

Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying,

## Ezekiel 33:24

“Son of man, they who live in these ruins in the land of Israel are saying, ‘Abraham was only one, yet he possessed the land; so to us who are many, the land has been given as a possession.’

## Ezekiel 33:25

Therefore say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says: “You eat meat with blood in it, raise your eyes to your idols as you shed blood. Should you then possess the land?

## Ezekiel 33:26

You rely on your sword, you commit abominations, and each of you defiles his neighbour’s wife. Should you then possess the land?”’

## Ezekiel 33:27

You shall say this to them: ‘This is what the Lord God says: “As I live, those who are in the ruins certainly will fall by the sword, and whoever is in the open field I will give to the animals to be devoured, and those who are in the strongholds and in the caves will die of plague.

## Ezekiel 33:28

And I will turn the land into a desolation and a waste, and the pride of her power will come to an end; and the mountains of Israel will be desolate, with no one passing through.

## Ezekiel 33:29

Then they will know that I am the Lord, when I make the land a desolation and a waste because of all their abominations which they have committed.”’

## Ezekiel 33:30

“But as for you, son of man, your fellow citizens who talk about you by the walls and at the doorways of the houses, speak to one another, each to his brother, saying, ‘Come now and hear what the message is that comes from the Lord.’

## Ezekiel 33:31

And they come to you as people come, and sit before you as My people and hear your words, but they do not practice them, for they express lustful desires with their mouths, and their heart follows their unlawful gain.

## Ezekiel 33:32

Behold, you are to them like a love song by one who has a beautiful voice and plays well on an instrument, for they hear your words but they do not practice them.

## Ezekiel 33:33

So when it comes—behold, it is coming—then they will know that a prophet has been among them.”
