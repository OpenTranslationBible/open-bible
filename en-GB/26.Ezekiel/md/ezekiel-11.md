# Ezekiel Chapter 11

## Ezekiel 11:1

The Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the east gate of the house of the Lord, which faces east. There, at the entrance of the gate, were twenty-five men, and among them I noticed Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, leaders of the people.

## Ezekiel 11:2

He said to me, “Son of man, these are the men who devise evil and offer wicked advice in this city.

## Ezekiel 11:3

They say, ‘Is it not time to build houses? This city is the pot, and we are the meat within it.’

## Ezekiel 11:4

Therefore, prophesy against them; prophesy, son of man.”

## Ezekiel 11:5

Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon me, and He instructed me to say: “This is what the Lord says: This is what you are thinking, house of Israel, but I know your thoughts.

## Ezekiel 11:6

You have slain many in this city and filled its streets with the dead.

## Ezekiel 11:7

Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: The bodies you have laid in the city are the meat and this city is the pot, but I will bring you out of it.

## Ezekiel 11:8

You fear the sword, and the sword is what I will bring upon you, declares the Sovereign Lord.

## Ezekiel 11:9

I will bring you out of the city and hand you over to foreigners, and execute judgments against you.

## Ezekiel 11:10

You will fall by the sword, and I will judge you at the borders of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Lord.

## Ezekiel 11:11

This city will not be a pot for you, nor will you be the meat inside it; I will judge you at the borders of Israel.

## Ezekiel 11:12

And you will know that I am the Lord, for you have not followed my statutes or kept my laws but have conformed to the customs of the nations around you.”

## Ezekiel 11:13

As I was prophesying, Pelatiah son of Benaiah died. I fell facedown and cried out in a loud voice, “Alas, Sovereign Lord! Will you completely destroy the remnant of Israel?”

## Ezekiel 11:14

Then a message from the Lord reached me:

## Ezekiel 11:15

“Son of man, your brothers, your relatives, your fellow exiles, and the entire house of Israel, all of them, are the ones about whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, ‘Keep far from the Lord; this land has been given to us as our possession.’

## Ezekiel 11:16

Therefore say: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Although I have sent them far away among the nations and scattered them among the countries, I have been a sanctuary for them for a little while in the countries where they have gone.’

## Ezekiel 11:17

Therefore say: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I will gather you from the peoples and bring you back from the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.’

## Ezekiel 11:18

When they return, they will remove all its detestable things and abominations.

## Ezekiel 11:19

I will give them a unified heart and put a new spirit within them; I will remove their heart of stone and give them a heart of flesh.

## Ezekiel 11:20

Then they will follow my statutes and be careful to observe my ordinances. They will be my people, and I will be their God.

## Ezekiel 11:21

But for those whose hearts pursue their detestable things and abominations, I will bring their conduct down on their own heads, declares the Sovereign Lord.”

## Ezekiel 11:22

At that moment, the cherubim, with the wheels beside them, extended their wings, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them.

## Ezekiel 11:23

The glory of the Lord rose from within the city and stood over the mountain east of it.

## Ezekiel 11:24

The Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the exiles in Chaldea, in the vision given by the Spirit of God. Then the vision I had seen departed from me,

## Ezekiel 11:25

and I recounted to the exiles all the things that the Lord had revealed.
