# Ezekiel Chapter 13

## Ezekiel 13:1

Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying,

## Ezekiel 13:2

“Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who prophesy, and say to those who prophesy from their own hearts, ‘Listen to the word of the Lord!

## Ezekiel 13:3

This is what the Lord God says: Woe to the foolish prophets who are following their own spirit and have seen nothing!

## Ezekiel 13:4

Israel, your prophets have been like foxes among ruins.

## Ezekiel 13:5

You have not gone up into the breaches, nor did you build the wall around the house of Israel to stand in the battle on the day of the Lord.

## Ezekiel 13:6

They see deceit and lying divination, those who are saying, ‘The Lord declares,’ when the Lord has not sent them; yet they hope for confirmation of their word.

## Ezekiel 13:7

Did you not see a false vision and speak a lying divination when you said, ‘The Lord declares,’ but it is not I who have spoken?”

## Ezekiel 13:8

Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: “Because you have spoken deceit and have seen a lie, therefore behold, I am against you,” declares the Lord God.

## Ezekiel 13:9

“So My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and utter lying divinations. They will have no place in the council of My people, nor will they be written down in the register of the house of Israel, nor will they enter the land of Israel. So you shall know that I am the Lord God.

## Ezekiel 13:10

It is definitely because they have misled My people by saying, ‘Peace!’ when there is no peace. And when anyone builds a wall, behold, they plaster it over with whitewash;

## Ezekiel 13:11

So tell those who plaster it over with whitewash that it will fall. A flooding rain will come, and you, hailstones, will fall, and a violent wind will break out.

## Ezekiel 13:12

Behold, when the wall has fallen, will you not be asked, ‘Where is the plaster with which you plastered it?’”

## Ezekiel 13:13

Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: “I will make a violent wind break out in My wrath. There will also be flooding rain in My anger and hailstones in wrath to destroy it.

## Ezekiel 13:14

So I will tear down the wall which you plastered with whitewash and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation is exposed. When it falls, you will perish in its midst; and you will know that I am the Lord.

## Ezekiel 13:15

So I will expend My wrath on the wall and on those who plastered it over with whitewash, and I will say to you, ‘The wall is gone and its plasterers are gone,

## Ezekiel 13:16

Along with the prophets of Israel who prophesy to Jerusalem and who see visions of peace for her when there is no peace,’ declares the Lord God.

## Ezekiel 13:17

“Now you, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people who are prophesying from their own imagination. Prophesy against them

## Ezekiel 13:18

And say, ‘This is what the Lord God says: Woe to the women who sew magic bands on all wrists and make veils for the heads of people of every stature to entrap lives! Will you entrap the lives of My people, but preserve your own lives?

## Ezekiel 13:19

And for handfuls of barley and scraps of bread, you profane Me among My people to put to death souls who should not die, and to keep alive souls who should not live, by your lying to My people who listen to lies.’”

## Ezekiel 13:20

Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: “Behold, I am against your magic bands by which you entrap lives as birds, and I will tear them off your arms; and I will let the lives go, the lives that you entrap as birds.

## Ezekiel 13:21

I will also tear off your veils and save My people from your hands, so they will no longer be under your influence. Then you will know that I am the Lord.

## Ezekiel 13:22

Because you disheartened the righteous with falsehood when I did not cause him grief, and have strengthened the hands of the wicked so that he does not turn from his evil way to keep him alive,

## Ezekiel 13:23

Therefore, you women will no longer see deceitful visions or practice divination, and I will save My people from your hands. So you will know that I am the Lord.”
