# Ezekiel Chapter 13

## Ezekiel 13:1
The word of the Lord came to me, saying:

## Ezekiel 13:2
“Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who are prophesying. Say to those who prophesy from their own inspiration: ‘Listen to the word of the Lord!

## Ezekiel 13:3
This is what the Sovereign Lord declares: Woe to the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit and have seen nothing!

## Ezekiel 13:4
Your prophets, Israel, are like jackals among the ruins.

## Ezekiel 13:5
You have not gone up to the breaches in the wall, nor built a wall around the house of Israel to stand firm in the battle on the day of the Lord.

## Ezekiel 13:6
Their visions are deceitful and their divinations a lie. They say, “The Lord declares,” when the Lord has not sent them, yet they expect their words to be fulfilled.

## Ezekiel 13:7
Have you not witnessed false visions and spoken lying divinations when you say, “The Lord declares,” though I have not spoken?

## Ezekiel 13:8
Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: Because you have spoken falsely and seen lies, I am against you, declares the Sovereign Lord.

## Ezekiel 13:9
My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and utter lying divinations. They will not be part of the council of my people, nor will they be recorded in the register of the house of Israel, nor will they enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Sovereign Lord.

## Ezekiel 13:10
Because they have led my people astray, saying, “Peace,” when there is no peace, and when a wall is built, they cover it with whitewash;

## Ezekiel 13:11
therefore tell those who cover it with whitewash that it will fall. Torrential rain will come, and I will send hailstones hurtling down, and a violent wind will break out.

## Ezekiel 13:12
When the wall collapses, will people not inquire, “Where is the whitewash you covered it with?”

## Ezekiel 13:13
Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord declares: In my wrath I will unleash a violent wind, and in my anger hailstones and torrents of rain will fall with destructive fury.

## Ezekiel 13:14
I will tear down the wall you have covered with whitewash and level it to the ground so that its foundation will be exposed. When it falls, you will perish within it; and you will know that I am the Lord.

## Ezekiel 13:15
So I will expend my wrath against the wall and against those who covered it with whitewash. I will say to you, “The wall is gone and so are those who whitewashed it,

## Ezekiel 13:16
those prophets of Israel who spoke of peace for Jerusalem when there was no peace,” declares the Sovereign Lord.

## Ezekiel 13:17
Now, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people who prophesy from their own imagination. Prophesy against them

## Ezekiel 13:18
and say, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord declares: Woe to the women who sew magic charms on all wrists and make veils for heads of every height to ensnare souls. Will you ensnare the lives of my people but preserve your own?

## Ezekiel 13:19
For a few handfuls of barley and scraps of bread, you have profaned me among my people, putting to death those who should not die and keeping alive those who should not live, by lying to my people who listen to lies.

## Ezekiel 13:20
Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord declares: I am against your magic charms with which you ensnare people like birds, and I will tear them from your arms; I will set free the people that you ensnare like birds.

## Ezekiel 13:21
I will remove your veils and rescue my people from your hands, and they will no longer fall prey to your power. Then you will know that I am the Lord.

## Ezekiel 13:22
Because you have disheartened the righteous with your lies, when I had brought them no grief, and because you have encouraged the wicked not to turn from their evil ways and save their lives,

## Ezekiel 13:23
therefore you will no longer see false visions or practice divination. I will save my people from your hands. Then you will know that I am the Lord.”
