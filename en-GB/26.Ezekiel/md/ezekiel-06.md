# Ezekiel Chapter 6

## Ezekiel 6:1

And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,

## Ezekiel 6:2

“Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them

## Ezekiel 6:3

And say, ‘Mountains of Israel, listen to the word of the Lord God! This is what the Lord God says to the mountains, the hills, the ravines, and the valleys: Behold, I Myself am going to bring a sword on you, and I will destroy your high places.

## Ezekiel 6:4

So your altars will become desolate and your incense altars smashed, and I will make your slain fall in front of your idols.

## Ezekiel 6:5

I will also lay the dead bodies of the sons of Israel in front of their idols, and I will scatter your bones around your altars.

## Ezekiel 6:6

In all your dwellings, cities will become waste and the high places will be desolate, so that your altars will become waste and desolate, your idols broken and brought to an end, your incense altars cut down, and your works wiped out.

## Ezekiel 6:7

The slain will fall among you, and you will know that I am the Lord.

## Ezekiel 6:8

However, I will leave a remnant, for you will have those who escape the sword among the nations when you are scattered among the lands.

## Ezekiel 6:9

Then those of you who escape will remember Me among the nations to which they have been taken captive, how I have been hurt by their adulterous hearts which turned away from Me, and by their eyes which played the harlot with their idols; and they will loathe themselves in their own sight for the evils which they have committed, for all their abominations.

## Ezekiel 6:10

Then they will know that I am the Lord; I have not spoken in vain that I would inflict this disaster on them.”’

## Ezekiel 6:11

This is what the Lord God says: “Clap your hands, stamp your foot, and say, ‘Woe, because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel, who will fall by the sword, famine, and plague!

## Ezekiel 6:12

One who is far away will die by the plague, one who is near will fall by the sword, and one who remains and is spared will die by the famine. So I will expend My wrath on them.

## Ezekiel 6:13

Then you will know that I am the Lord, when their slain are among their idols around their altars, on every high hill, on all the tops of the mountains, under every green tree, and under every leafy oak—the places where they offered a soothing aroma to all their idols.

## Ezekiel 6:14

So throughout all their dwellings I will stretch out My hand against them and make the land more desolate and devastated than the wilderness toward Diblah; and they will know that I am the Lord.”
