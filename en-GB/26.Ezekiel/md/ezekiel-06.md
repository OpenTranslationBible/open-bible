# Ezekiel Chapter 6

## Ezekiel 6:1
The message from the Lord reached me:

## Ezekiel 6:2
“Son of man, turn your face towards the mountains of Israel and prophesy against them.

## Ezekiel 6:3
Say: ‘Mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Sovereign Lord. This is what the Sovereign Lord says to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys: Behold, I am going to bring a sword against you, and I will destroy your high places.

## Ezekiel 6:4
Your altars will be laid waste and your incense altars will be shattered; I will cause your slain to fall in front of your idols.

## Ezekiel 6:5
I will lay the corpses of the Israelites before their idols, and I will scatter your bones around your altars.

## Ezekiel 6:6
Wherever you dwell, your cities will become ruins and your high places will be desolate, so that your altars will lie in ruins and be devastated, your idols will be broken and brought to an end, your incense altars will be cut down, and your works wiped out.

## Ezekiel 6:7
Those who are slain will fall among you, and you will come to know that I am the Lord.

## Ezekiel 6:8
“‘Yet I will leave a remnant, for some of you will escape the sword when you are scattered among the nations.

## Ezekiel 6:9
Then, among the nations where they have been taken captive, those who escape will remember me—how I was grieved by their adulterous hearts that turned away from me, and by their eyes that lusted after their idols. They will loathe themselves for the evil they have done and for all their detestable practices.

## Ezekiel 6:10
And they will know that I am the Lord; I did not speak in vain that I would bring this disaster upon them.

## Ezekiel 6:11
“‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Clap your hands, stamp your feet and cry out “Alas!” because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel, for they will fall by the sword, famine, and plague.

## Ezekiel 6:12
Those who are far off will die of plague, those who are near will fall by the sword, and those who survive and are spared will die of famine. Thus will I expend my wrath upon them.

## Ezekiel 6:13
And you will know that I am the Lord, when their slain lie among their idols around their altars, on every high hill and on all the mountain tops, under every spreading tree and every leafy oak—the places where they offered fragrant incense to all their idols.

## Ezekiel 6:14
I will stretch out my hand against them and make the land a desolate waste from the wilderness to Diblah—wherever they dwell. Then they will know that I am the Lord.’”
