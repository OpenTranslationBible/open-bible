# Ezekiel Chapter 43

## Ezekiel 43:1
Then he led me to the gate that faces east.

## Ezekiel 43:2
And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was coming from the east. His voice was like the sound of many waters, and the earth shone with His glory.

## Ezekiel 43:3
The vision I saw was like the vision I had seen when He came to destroy the city, and like the visions I had seen by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.

## Ezekiel 43:4
And the glory of the Lord entered the temple through the gate facing east.

## Ezekiel 43:5
The Spirit carried me into the inner court, and behold, the glory of the Lord filled the temple.

## Ezekiel 43:6
Then I heard someone speaking to me from inside the temple, while the man was standing beside me.

## Ezekiel 43:7
He said to me, “Son of man, this is the place of My throne and the place for the soles of My feet, where I will dwell among the Israelites forever. The house of Israel will no longer defile My holy name, neither they nor their kings, by their prostitution or by the corpses of their kings at their death.

## Ezekiel 43:8
By placing their threshold next to My threshold and their doorposts beside My doorposts, with only a wall between Me and them, they defiled My holy name by their abominations. So I consumed them in My anger.

## Ezekiel 43:9
Let them put away their acts of unfaithfulness and the remains of their kings far from Me, and I will dwell among them forever.

## Ezekiel 43:10
“As for you, son of man, describe the temple to the house of Israel, so that they may be ashamed of their sins, and let them measure the plan.

## Ezekiel 43:11
If they are ashamed of all they have done, make known to them the design of the temple—its layout, its exits and entrances, its entire design, all its statutes and laws. Write these down in their sight, so that they may observe its complete design and follow all its statutes.

## Ezekiel 43:12
This is the law of the temple: the entire area on top of the mountain all around shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the temple.

## Ezekiel 43:13
“These are the measurements of the altar in long cubits (a cubit being a cubit and a handbreadth): the base shall be a cubit deep and a cubit wide, with a border of one span around its edge. This is the height of the altar:

## Ezekiel 43:14
From the base on the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cubits high, and the ledge shall be a cubit wide. From the smaller ledge to the larger ledge shall be four cubits high, and the ledge shall also be a cubit wide.

## Ezekiel 43:15
The altar hearth shall be four cubits high, and four horns shall project upward from the hearth.

## Ezekiel 43:16
The altar hearth shall be square, twelve cubits long and twelve cubits wide.

## Ezekiel 43:17
The upper ledge shall also be square, fourteen cubits long and fourteen cubits wide. All around the altar is a gutter of one cubit with a rim of half a cubit. The steps of the altar shall face east.”

## Ezekiel 43:18
Then He said to me, “Son of man, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: ‘These are the regulations for the altar on the day it is built, to offer burnt offerings on it and to sprinkle blood against it.

## Ezekiel 43:19
You shall give a young bull as a sin offering to the Levitical priests of the family of Zadok, who come near to minister before Me,’ declares the Sovereign Lord.

## Ezekiel 43:20
You shall take some of its blood and put it on the four horns of the altar and on the four corners of the ledge and all around the rim, and so purify the altar and make atonement for it.

## Ezekiel 43:21
You shall take the bull for the sin offering and burn it in the designated part of the temple area outside the sanctuary.

## Ezekiel 43:22
‘On the second day you shall offer a male goat without defect as a sin offering, and the altar shall be purified as it was purified with the bull.

## Ezekiel 43:23
When you have finished purifying it, you shall offer a young bull and a ram from the flock, both without defect.

## Ezekiel 43:24
You shall offer them before the Lord, and the priests shall sprinkle salt on them and offer them up as a burnt offering to the Lord.

## Ezekiel 43:25
For seven days you shall provide a male goat daily for a sin offering; you shall also provide a young bull and a ram from the flock, both without defect.

## Ezekiel 43:26
For seven days they shall make atonement for the altar and cleanse it; thus they shall consecrate it.

## Ezekiel 43:27
At the end of these days, from the eighth day onward, the priests shall present your burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar; and I will accept you,’ declares the Sovereign Lord.”
