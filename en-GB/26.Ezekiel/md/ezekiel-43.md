# Ezekiel Chapter 43

## Ezekiel 43:1

Then he led me to the gate, the gate facing east;

## Ezekiel 43:2

And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was coming from the way of the east. And His voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth shone from His glory.

## Ezekiel 43:3

And it was like the appearance of the vision which I saw, like the vision which I saw when He came to destroy the city. And the visions were like the vision which I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.

## Ezekiel 43:4

And the glory of the Lord came into the house by way of the gate facing east.

## Ezekiel 43:5

And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner courtyard; and behold, the glory of the Lord filled the house.

## Ezekiel 43:6

Then I heard Him speaking to me from the house, while a man was standing beside me.

## Ezekiel 43:7

And He said to me, “Son of man, this is the place of My throne and the place of the soles of My feet, where I will dwell among the sons of Israel forever. And the house of Israel shall no longer defile My holy name, neither they nor their kings, by their prostitution and by the corpses of their kings when they die,

## Ezekiel 43:8

By putting their threshold next to My threshold and their door beside My door, with only the wall between Me and them. And they have defiled My holy name by their abominations which they have committed. So I have consumed them in My anger.

## Ezekiel 43:9

Now let them remove their prostitution and the corpses of their kings far from Me; and I will dwell among them forever.

## Ezekiel 43:10

As for you, son of man, inform the house of Israel about the temple, so that they will be ashamed of their guilt and they shall measure the plan.

## Ezekiel 43:11

And if they are ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the design of the house, its layout, its exits, its entrances, all its designs, all its statutes, and all its laws. And write it in their sight, so that they may observe its entire design and all its statutes and do them.

## Ezekiel 43:12

This is the law of the house: Its entire territory all around on the top of the mountain shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.

## Ezekiel 43:13

“And these are the measurements of the altar by cubits (the cubit being a cubit and a handbreadth): the base shall be a cubit and the width a cubit, and its border on its edge all around one span; and this shall be the height of the base of the altar.

## Ezekiel 43:14

And from the base on the ground to the lower ledge shall be two cubits, and the width one cubit; and from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge shall be four cubits, and the width one cubit.

## Ezekiel 43:15

The altar hearth shall be four cubits; and from the altar hearth shall extend upward four horns.

## Ezekiel 43:16

Now the altar hearth shall be twelve cubits long by twelve wide, square in its four sides.

## Ezekiel 43:17

The ledge shall be fourteen cubits long by fourteen wide in its four sides, the border around it shall be half a cubit, and its base shall be a cubit all around; and its steps shall face east.

## Ezekiel 43:18

And He said to me, “Son of man, this is what the Lord God says: ‘These are the statutes for the altar on the day it is built, to offer burnt offerings on it and to sprinkle blood on it.

## Ezekiel 43:19

You shall give to the Levitical priests who are from the descendants of Zadok, who come near to Me to serve Me,’ declares the Lord God, ‘a bull as a sin offering.

## Ezekiel 43:20

And you shall take some of its blood and put it on its four horns, on the four corners of the ledge, and on the border all around; so you shall cleanse it and make atonement for it.

## Ezekiel 43:21

You shall also take the bull as the sin offering, and it shall be burned in the appointed place of the house, outside the sanctuary.

## Ezekiel 43:22

And on the second day you shall offer a male goat without blemish as a sin offering, and they shall cleanse the altar from sin as they cleansed it with the bull.

## Ezekiel 43:23

When you have finished cleansing it, you shall offer a bull without blemish and a ram without blemish from the flock.

## Ezekiel 43:24

You shall offer them before the Lord, and the priests shall throw salt on them, and they shall offer them up as a burnt offering to the Lord.

## Ezekiel 43:25

For seven days you shall prepare daily a goat as a sin offering; they shall also prepare a bull and a ram from the flock, without blemish.

## Ezekiel 43:26

For seven days they shall make atonement for the altar and purify it; so shall they consecrate it.

## Ezekiel 43:27

And when they have completed the days, it shall be that on the eighth day and onward, the priests shall offer your burnt offerings on the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you,’ declares the Lord God.”
