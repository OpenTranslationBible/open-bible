# Ezekiel Chapter 14

## Ezekiel 14:1
Some elders of Israel approached me and sat down before me.

## Ezekiel 14:2
And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:

## Ezekiel 14:3
“Son of man, these men have set up idols in their hearts and placed a stumbling block of wrongdoing before their faces. Should I allow them to consult me at all?

## Ezekiel 14:4
Therefore speak to them and say, ‘This is what the Lord God says: When any of the house of Israel sets up idols in their heart and places a stumbling block of wrongdoing before their face, and then comes to the prophet, I the Lord will answer them in accordance with their idolatry.

## Ezekiel 14:5
I will do this to reclaim the hearts of the house of Israel, who have all turned away from me for their idols.’

## Ezekiel 14:6
“Therefore say to the house of Israel, ‘This is what the Lord God says: Repent and turn away from your idols, and renounce all your detestable practices!

## Ezekiel 14:7
When any of the Israelites or any foreigner residing in Israel separates themselves from me, sets up idols in their hearts, and places a stumbling block of wrongdoing before their faces, and then comes to a prophet to inquire of me, I the Lord will answer them myself.

## Ezekiel 14:8
I will set my face against that person and make them a sign and a proverb, and I will remove them from my people. Then you will know that I am the Lord.

## Ezekiel 14:9
And if the prophet is enticed to speak a word, it is I, the Lord, who have enticed that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand against him and eliminate him from among my people Israel.

## Ezekiel 14:10
They will bear their punishment—the prophet will be as guilty as the one who consults him.

## Ezekiel 14:11
Then the house of Israel will no longer stray from me, nor will they defile themselves with all their offences. They will be my people, and I will be their God, declares the Lord God.”

## Ezekiel 14:12
Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying:

## Ezekiel 14:13
“Son of man, if a country sins against me by being unfaithful and I stretch out my hand against it to destroy its food supply and send famine upon it and eliminate both human and animal life,

## Ezekiel 14:14
even if these three men—Noah, Daniel, and Job—were in it, they could save only themselves by their righteousness, declares the Lord God.

## Ezekiel 14:15
If I were to send wild beasts through the land and they depopulate it, making it desolate so that no one can pass through it because of the beasts,

## Ezekiel 14:16
as surely as I live, declares the Lord God, even if these three men were in it, they could not save their sons or daughters. They alone would be saved, but the land would be desolate.

## Ezekiel 14:17
Or if I bring a sword against that country and say, ‘Let the sword pass throughout the land,’ and I eliminate human and animal life from it,

## Ezekiel 14:18
as surely as I live, declares the Lord God, even if these three men were in it, they could not save their sons or daughters. They alone would be saved.

## Ezekiel 14:19
Or if I send a plague into that land and pour out my wrath on it through bloodshed, eliminating human and animal life,

## Ezekiel 14:20
as surely as I live, declares the Lord God, even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, they could not save their sons or daughters. They would save only themselves by their righteousness.

## Ezekiel 14:21
For this is what the Lord God says: How much worse will it be when I send my four severe judgments against Jerusalem—sword, famine, wild beasts, and plague—to eliminate human and animal life!

## Ezekiel 14:22
Yet there will be some survivors—sons and daughters who will be brought out. They will come to you, and when you see their conduct and actions, you will be comforted regarding the disaster I have brought upon Jerusalem—every disaster I have brought upon it.

## Ezekiel 14:23
You will be comforted when you see their conduct and actions, for you will know that I have done nothing in it without cause, declares the Lord God.”
