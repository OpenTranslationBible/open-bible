# Ezekiel Chapter 4

## Ezekiel 4:1
“Now, son of man, take a brick and set it before you, and inscribe upon it a city—Jerusalem.

## Ezekiel 4:2
Then lay siege against it: construct a siege wall, build a ramp, set up camps, and place battering rams all around it.

## Ezekiel 4:3
Then take an iron plate and set it up as an iron wall between yourself and the city, and direct your face toward it. It shall be under siege, and you shall besiege it. This will be a sign to the house of Israel.

## Ezekiel 4:4
“Lie on your left side and place the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it. You shall bear their iniquity for the number of days you lie on it.

## Ezekiel 4:5
I have assigned you the same number of days as the years of their iniquity, 390 days; thus you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.

## Ezekiel 4:6
When you have completed these days, lie down again, this time on your right side, and bear the iniquity of the house of Judah. I have assigned you forty days, a day for each year.

## Ezekiel 4:7
Direct your face toward the siege of Jerusalem and with bared arm prophesy against it.

## Ezekiel 4:8
I will bind you with ropes so that you cannot turn from one side to the other until you have completed the days of your siege.

## Ezekiel 4:9
“Take wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt; place them in a single vessel and make them into bread for yourself. You shall eat it according to the number of days you lie on your side, 390 days.

## Ezekiel 4:10
The food you eat shall be weighed, twenty shekels a day; you shall eat it at set times.

## Ezekiel 4:11
The water you drink shall be a sixth of a hin by measure; you shall drink it at set times.

## Ezekiel 4:12
You shall eat it as a barley cake, having baked it in their sight over an unusual fuel.”

## Ezekiel 4:13
The Lord said, “In this manner the sons of Israel will eat their bread defiled among the nations where I will scatter them.”

## Ezekiel 4:14
Then I said, “Ah, Lord God! I have never been defiled; from my youth until now I have not eaten anything that died of itself or was torn by animals, nor has any unclean meat entered my mouth.”

## Ezekiel 4:15
He said to me, “See, I will give you cow dung instead of human dung, so that you may prepare your bread over it.”

## Ezekiel 4:16
He then said to me: “Son of man, behold, I am about to break the staff of bread in Jerusalem. They shall eat bread by weight and with anxiety, and drink water by measure and in dismay,

## Ezekiel 4:17
because food and water will be scarce. They will look at one another in horror and waste away in their guilt.
