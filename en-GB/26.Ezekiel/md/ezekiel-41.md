# Ezekiel Chapter 41

## Ezekiel 41:1
Then the man led me to the sanctuary, and he measured the side pillars; each side pillar was six cubits wide.

## Ezekiel 41:2
The entrance was ten cubits wide, with sides of five cubits each. He measured the sanctuary, which was forty cubits long and twenty cubits wide.

## Ezekiel 41:3
He then moved into the inner area and measured the door jambs, each two cubits wide. The entrance was six cubits wide, and the projecting walls were seven cubits wide.

## Ezekiel 41:4
He measured the inner sanctuary, which was twenty cubits long and twenty cubits wide, in front of the main hall. He said to me, “This is the Most Holy Place.”

## Ezekiel 41:5
He measured the temple wall, which was six cubits thick, and the side rooms, which were four cubits wide all around the temple.

## Ezekiel 41:6
The side rooms were arranged in three levels, with thirty rooms on each level. They were supported by ledges on the temple wall, but the supports did not penetrate the temple wall itself.

## Ezekiel 41:7
The side rooms became wider with each ascending level. The structure was built in stages, allowing the rooms to widen as one ascended. A staircase led from the lowest to the highest level via the middle level.

## Ezekiel 41:8
I observed that the temple had a raised base surrounding it, forming the foundation of the side rooms; this base was a full rod of six long cubits in height.

## Ezekiel 41:9
The outer wall of the side rooms was five cubits thick. The open space between the temple side rooms

## Ezekiel 41:10
and the outer chambers was twenty cubits wide all around the temple.

## Ezekiel 41:11
There were doorways to the side rooms from the open space, one facing north and another facing south; the width of the open space was five cubits all around.

## Ezekiel 41:12
The building facing the temple courtyard on the west side was seventy cubits wide, with a wall five cubits thick and a length of ninety cubits.

## Ezekiel 41:13
He measured the temple, which was a hundred cubits long, and the courtyard and building with its walls were also a hundred cubits long.

## Ezekiel 41:14
The width of the temple courtyard on the east, including the front of the temple, was a hundred cubits.

## Ezekiel 41:15
He measured the length of the building facing the courtyard at the rear of the temple, including its galleries on each side; it was a hundred cubits. This included the main hall, the inner sanctuary, and the portico facing the courtyard.

## Ezekiel 41:16
The thresholds, narrow windows, and galleries around the three of them were panelled with wood from the ground to the windows, which were covered.

## Ezekiel 41:17
Above the entrance to the inner sanctuary and on the walls, both inside and outside, at regular intervals, were measured carvings.

## Ezekiel 41:18
Cherubim and palm trees were carved, with a palm tree between each cherub. Each cherub had two faces:

## Ezekiel 41:19
A human face looked toward the palm tree on one side, and a lion’s face looked toward the palm tree on the other side. These were carved all around the temple.

## Ezekiel 41:20
From the floor to above the entrance, cherubim and palm trees were carved on the walls of the sanctuary.

## Ezekiel 41:21
The doorposts of the sanctuary were square, and the appearance of the doorposts of the Most Holy Place was similar.

## Ezekiel 41:22
There was a wooden altar three cubits high and two cubits square; its corners, base, and sides were of wood. He said to me, “This is the table that is before the Lord.”

## Ezekiel 41:23
Both the sanctuary and the Most Holy Place had double doors.

## Ezekiel 41:24
Each door had two leaves, two hinged leaves for each door.

## Ezekiel 41:25
Cherubim and palm trees were carved on the doors of the main hall, similar to those on the walls, and there was a wooden overhang at the front of the portico.

## Ezekiel 41:26
Latticed windows and palm trees adorned the sidewalls of the portico on each side, as well as on the side chambers of the temple and the thresholds.
