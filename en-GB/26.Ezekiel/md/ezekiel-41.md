# Ezekiel Chapter 41

## Ezekiel 41:1

Then he brought me to the main room and measured the side pillars; six cubits wide on each side was the width of the side pillar.

## Ezekiel 41:2

The width of the entrance was ten cubits, and the sides of the entrance were five cubits on each side. And he measured the length of the main room, forty cubits, and the width, twenty cubits.

## Ezekiel 41:3

Then he went inside and measured each side pillar of the doorway, two cubits, and the doorway, six cubits high; and the width of the doorway, seven cubits.

## Ezekiel 41:4

And he measured its length, twenty cubits, and the width, twenty cubits, in front of the main room; and he said to me, “This is the Most Holy Place.”

## Ezekiel 41:5

Then he measured the wall of the temple, six cubits; and the width of the side chambers, four cubits, all around about the temple on every side.

## Ezekiel 41:6

The side chambers were in three stories, one above another, and thirty in each story; and they were offset all around in the wall which was on the sides of the temple for the side chambers, so that they were not supported by the wall of the temple itself.

## Ezekiel 41:7

The side chambers all around widened as they went up, because the structure surrounding the temple went upward by stages on all sides of the temple; therefore the width of the temple increased as it went higher. And so one went up from the lowest story to the top story by way of the second story.

## Ezekiel 41:8

I saw also that the house had a raised platform all around; the foundations of the side chambers were a full rod of six long cubits in height.

## Ezekiel 41:9

The thickness of the outer wall of the side chambers was five cubits. But the free space between the side chambers of the temple

## Ezekiel 41:10

And the outer chambers was twenty cubits wide all around the temple on every side.

## Ezekiel 41:11

The doorways of the side chambers toward the free space consisted of one doorway toward the north and another doorway toward the south; and the width of the free space was five cubits all around.

## Ezekiel 41:12

The building that was in front of the separate area at the side toward the west was seventy cubits wide; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length was ninety cubits.

## Ezekiel 41:13

Then he measured the temple, a hundred cubits long. The separate area with the building and its walls were also a hundred cubits long.

## Ezekiel 41:14

Also the width of the front of the temple and the separate areas to the east totaled a hundred cubits.

## Ezekiel 41:15

Then he measured the length of the building along the front of the separate area behind it, with a gallery on each side, a hundred cubits, as well as the inner temple and the porches of the courtyard.

## Ezekiel 41:16

The thresholds, the latticed windows, and the galleries all around their three stories, opposite the threshold, were paneled with wood all around, and from the ground up to the windows (but the windows were covered),

## Ezekiel 41:17

Over the entrance and to the inner house, and on the outside, and on all the wall all around inside and outside, by measurement.

## Ezekiel 41:18

It was decorated with cherubim and palm trees; a palm tree was between cherub and cherub, and each cherub had two faces:

## Ezekiel 41:19

A human face toward the palm tree on one side and a lion’s face toward the palm tree on the other side. They were carved on all the house all around.

## Ezekiel 41:20

From the ground to above the entrance the cherubim and palm trees were carved, as well as on the wall of the main room.

## Ezekiel 41:21

The doorposts of the main room were square; and in front of the Most Holy Place there was something resembling

## Ezekiel 41:22

An altar of wood, three cubits high and two cubits long; its corners, its base, and its sides were of wood. And he said to me, “This is the table that is before the Lord.”

## Ezekiel 41:23

The main room and the sanctuary each had a double door.

## Ezekiel 41:24

Each of the doors had two leaves, two swinging leaves; two leaves for one door and two leaves for the other.

## Ezekiel 41:25

Also on the doors of the main room were carved cherubim and palm trees like those carved on the walls; and there was a canopy of wood on the front of the porch outside.

## Ezekiel 41:26

There were latticed windows and palm trees on one side and on the other, on the side walls of the porch; this is how the side chambers of the temple were arranged.
