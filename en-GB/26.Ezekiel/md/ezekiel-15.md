# Ezekiel Chapter 15

## Ezekiel 15:1
The word of the Lord came to me, saying:

## Ezekiel 15:2
“Son of man, how is the wood of a vine superior to any branch from the trees in the forest?

## Ezekiel 15:3
Can wood be taken from it to make anything useful? Can even a peg be made from it to hang any item upon?

## Ezekiel 15:4
If it is cast into the fire for fuel, and the fire devours both ends and chars the middle, is it then useful for anything?

## Ezekiel 15:5
While it was whole, it was not made into anything. How much less can it be used for anything once it is consumed by fire and charred?

## Ezekiel 15:6
Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: Just as the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest is given to the fire for fuel, so will I treat the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

## Ezekiel 15:7
I will set my face against them. Though they have come out of the fire, the fire will still consume them. And you will know that I am the Lord when I set my face against them.

## Ezekiel 15:8
I will make the land desolate because they have acted unfaithfully, declares the Sovereign Lord.”
