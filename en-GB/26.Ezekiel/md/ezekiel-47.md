# Ezekiel Chapter 47

## Ezekiel 47:1
The man then brought me back to the entrance of the house, and I noticed water flowing from beneath the threshold of the house towards the east, as the house faced east. The water was coming down from the right side of the house, south of the altar.

## Ezekiel 47:2
He led me out through the north gate and took me around the outside to the outer gate facing east, and there was water trickling from the south side.

## Ezekiel 47:3
As the man proceeded eastward with a measuring line in his hand, he measured a thousand cubits and led me through water that reached the ankles.

## Ezekiel 47:4
He measured another thousand cubits and led me through water reaching the knees. He measured another thousand and led me through water reaching the waist.

## Ezekiel 47:5
He measured another thousand, and it had become a river that I could not cross, for the water had risen and was deep enough to swim in—a river that could not be crossed.

## Ezekiel 47:6
He asked me, “Son of man, have you seen this?” Then he brought me back to the bank of the river.

## Ezekiel 47:7
Upon my return, I saw a great number of trees on either side of the riverbank.

## Ezekiel 47:8
He said to me, “These waters flow towards the eastern region and descend into the Arabah, where they enter the sea. When they flow into the sea, the salty water there becomes fresh.

## Ezekiel 47:9
Every living creature that swarms wherever the river flows will live. There will be a great abundance of fish, for these waters go there and make the salt water fresh; so everything will live wherever the river goes.

## Ezekiel 47:10
Fishermen will stand along the shore; from En Gedi to En Eglaim there will be places for spreading nets. The fish will be of many kinds, like the fish of the Great Sea.

## Ezekiel 47:11
However, the swamps and marshes will remain salty; they will be reserved for salt.

## Ezekiel 47:12
On the banks of the river, on both sides, will grow all kinds of trees for food. Their leaves will not wither, nor will their fruit fail. They will bear fruit every month because the water from the sanctuary flows to them. Their fruit will be for food and their leaves for healing.”

## Ezekiel 47:13
This is what the Sovereign Lord says: “These are the boundaries by which you will divide the land among the twelve tribes of Israel, with Joseph receiving two portions.

## Ezekiel 47:14
You are to divide it equally among them, for I swore to give it to your ancestors, and this land will become your inheritance.

## Ezekiel 47:15
“This is to be the boundary of the land: on the north side, it will run from the Great Sea by the way of Hethlon to the entrance of Zedad,

## Ezekiel 47:16
Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the borders of Damascus and Hamath, as far as Hazer Hattikon, which is on the border of Hauran.

## Ezekiel 47:17
The boundary will extend from the sea to Hazar Enan, at the border of Damascus, with the border of Hamath to the north. This is the northern boundary.

## Ezekiel 47:18
“On the east side, the boundary will run between Hauran and Damascus, along the Jordan between Gilead and the land of Israel, to the eastern sea and as far as Tamar. This is the eastern boundary.

## Ezekiel 47:19
“On the south side, it will run from Tamar as far as the waters of Meribah Kadesh, then along the Wadi of Egypt to the Great Sea. This is the southern boundary.

## Ezekiel 47:20
“On the west side, the Great Sea will be the boundary to a point opposite Lebo Hamath. This is the western boundary.

## Ezekiel 47:21
“You are to allocate this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel.

## Ezekiel 47:22
You are to allot it as an inheritance for yourselves and for the foreigners residing among you who have children. You are to consider them as native-born Israelites; they shall share an inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.

## Ezekiel 47:23
In whichever tribe a foreigner resides, there you are to grant them their inheritance,” declares the Sovereign Lord.
