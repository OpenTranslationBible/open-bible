# Ezekiel Chapter 18

## Ezekiel 18:1

Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying,

## Ezekiel 18:2

“What do you mean by using this proverb about the land of Israel, saying, ‘The fathers eat sour grapes, but the children’s teeth are set on edge’?

## Ezekiel 18:3

As I live,” declares the Lord God, “you certainly are not going to use this proverb in Israel anymore.

## Ezekiel 18:4

Behold, all souls are Mine; the soul of the father as well as the soul of the son is Mine. The soul who sins will die.

## Ezekiel 18:5

But if a man is righteous and practices justice and righteousness,

## Ezekiel 18:6

If he does not eat at the mountain shrines or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, or defile his neighbour’s wife or approach a woman during her menstrual period—

## Ezekiel 18:7

And if he does not oppress anyone, but restores to the debtor his pledge, does not commit robbery, but gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with clothing,

## Ezekiel 18:8

If he does not lend money at interest or take increase, if he keeps his hand from injustice and executes true justice between people,

## Ezekiel 18:9

If he walks in My statutes and keeps My ordinances so as to deal faithfully—he is righteous and shall certainly live,” declares the Lord God.

## Ezekiel 18:10

“However, he may have a violent son who sheds blood and commits any of these things to a brother,

## Ezekiel 18:11

Though he himself did not do any of these things—he even eats at the mountain shrines, defiles his neighbour’s wife,

## Ezekiel 18:12

Oppresses the poor and needy, commits robbery, does not restore a pledge, lifts up his eyes to the idols, and commits abomination,

## Ezekiel 18:13

Lends money at interest and takes increase—will he live? He will not live! He has committed all these abominations, he will surely be put to death; his blood will be on himself.

## Ezekiel 18:14

“Now behold, he has a son who observes all his father’s sins which he committed, and, seeing them, does not do likewise.

## Ezekiel 18:15

He does not eat at the mountain shrines, does not lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, or defile his neighbour’s wife,

## Ezekiel 18:16

Or oppress anyone, or keep a pledge that has been given as security, or commit robbery, but he gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with clothing,

## Ezekiel 18:17

He keeps his hand from the poor, does not take interest or increase, but executes My ordinances and walks in My statutes—he will not die for his father’s guilt, he will certainly live.

## Ezekiel 18:18

As for his father, because he practiced extortion, robbed his brother, and did what is not good among his people, behold, he will die for his guilt.

## Ezekiel 18:19

“Yet you say, ‘Why should the son not bear the punishment for the father’s guilt?’ When the son has practiced justice and righteousness, has kept all My statutes and done them, he shall certainly live.

## Ezekiel 18:20

The person who sins will die. A son will not bear the punishment for the father’s guilt, nor will a father bear the punishment for the son’s guilt; the righteousness of the righteous will be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked will be upon himself.

## Ezekiel 18:21

“But if the wicked person turns from all his sins which he has committed and keeps all My statutes and practices justice and righteousness, he shall certainly live; he shall not die.

## Ezekiel 18:22

All his offenses which he has committed will not be remembered against him; because of his righteousness which he has practiced, he will live.

## Ezekiel 18:23

Do I take any pleasure in the death of the wicked,” declares the Lord God, “rather than that he would turn from his ways and live?

## Ezekiel 18:24

But when a righteous person turns away from his righteousness, commits injustice, and does according to all the abominations that a wicked person does, will he live? All his righteous deeds which he has done will not be remembered; for his treachery and his sin which he has committed, he will die.

## Ezekiel 18:25

“Yet you say, ‘The way of the Lord is not right.’ Hear now, house of Israel! Is My way not right? Is it not your ways that are not right?

## Ezekiel 18:26

When a righteous person turns away from his righteousness and commits injustice, and dies because of it, it is for his injustice which he has committed that he dies.

## Ezekiel 18:27

But when a wicked person turns away from his wickedness which he has committed and practices justice and righteousness, he will save his life.

## Ezekiel 18:28

Because he considered and turned away from all his offenses which he had committed, he shall certainly live; he shall not die.

## Ezekiel 18:29

But the house of Israel says, ‘The way of the Lord is not right.’ Are My ways not right, house of Israel? Is it not your ways that are not right?

## Ezekiel 18:30

“Therefore I will judge you, house of Israel, each according to his conduct,” declares the Lord God. “Repent and turn away from all your offenses, so that wrongdoing does not become a stumbling block to you.

## Ezekiel 18:31

Hurl away from you all your offenses which you have committed and make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit! For why should you die, house of Israel?

## Ezekiel 18:32

For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone who dies,” declares the Lord God. “Therefore, repent and live!”
