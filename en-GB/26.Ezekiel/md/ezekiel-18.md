# Ezekiel Chapter 18

## Ezekiel 18:1
The message from the Lord came to me, saying:

## Ezekiel 18:2
“What do you mean by repeating this proverb concerning the land of Israel: ‘The fathers eat sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge’?

## Ezekiel 18:3
As surely as I live,” declares the Lord God, “you shall no longer use this proverb in Israel.

## Ezekiel 18:4
Behold, all souls are mine; the soul of the father as well as the soul of the son is mine. The soul who sins is the one who will die.

## Ezekiel 18:5
“But if a man is righteous and does what is just and right—

## Ezekiel 18:6
if he does not eat at the mountain shrines or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, does not defile his neighbour’s wife or approach a woman during her menstrual impurity—

## Ezekiel 18:7
if he does not oppress anyone, but restores to the debtor his pledge, does not commit robbery, but gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with clothing,

## Ezekiel 18:8
if he does not lend at interest or take any profit, withholds his hand from injustice and executes true justice between one person and another,

## Ezekiel 18:9
if he walks in my statutes and keeps my ordinances by acting faithfully—he is righteous; he shall surely live,” declares the Lord God.

## Ezekiel 18:10
“If he has a son who is violent, one who sheds blood, and does any of these things—

## Ezekiel 18:11
though he himself did none of these things—who even eats at the mountain shrines, defiles his neighbour’s wife,

## Ezekiel 18:12
oppresses the poor and needy, commits robbery, does not restore the pledge, lifts up his eyes to the idols, commits abomination,

## Ezekiel 18:13
lends at interest and takes profit; shall he then live? He shall not live! He has done all these abominations; he shall surely be put to death; his blood shall be upon himself.

## Ezekiel 18:14
“Now suppose this man has a son who sees all the sins that his father has done; he sees, and does not do likewise:

## Ezekiel 18:15
he does not eat at the mountain shrines or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, does not defile his neighbour’s wife,

## Ezekiel 18:16
does not oppress anyone, exacts no pledge, does not commit robbery, but gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with clothing,

## Ezekiel 18:17
withholds his hand from wrong, takes no interest or profit, obeys my statutes and walks in my ordinances; he shall not die for his father’s iniquity; he shall surely live.

## Ezekiel 18:18
As for his father, because he engaged in extortion, robbed his brother, and acted unjustly among his people, he shall die for his wrongdoing.

## Ezekiel 18:19
“Yet you say, ‘Why should not the son suffer for the iniquity of the father?’ When the son has done what is just and right, and has kept all my statutes and observed them, he shall surely live.

## Ezekiel 18:20
The soul who sins shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, nor shall the father bear the iniquity of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon himself.

## Ezekiel 18:21
“But if a wicked person turns away from all his sins and keeps all my statutes and does what is just and right, he shall surely live; he shall not die.

## Ezekiel 18:22
None of the transgressions he has committed will be remembered against him; for the righteousness he has done, he shall live.

## Ezekiel 18:23
Do I take any pleasure in the death of the wicked,” declares the Lord God, “rather than that he should turn from his ways and live?

## Ezekiel 18:24
“But when a righteous person turns away from his righteousness and commits iniquity and does the same abominations that the wicked person does, shall he live? None of the righteous deeds that he has done shall be remembered; for the treachery of which he is guilty and the sin he has committed, for them he shall die.

## Ezekiel 18:25
“Yet you say, ‘The way of the Lord is not just.’ Hear now, O house of Israel: Is my way not just? Is it not your ways that are not just?

## Ezekiel 18:26
When a righteous person turns away from his righteousness and commits iniquity, he shall die for it; for the iniquity that he has committed he shall die.

## Ezekiel 18:27
When a wicked person turns away from his wickedness and does what is just and right, he shall save his life.

## Ezekiel 18:28
Because he considered and turned away from all the transgressions he had committed, he shall surely live; he shall not die.

## Ezekiel 18:29
Yet the house of Israel says, ‘The way of the Lord is not just.’ O house of Israel, are my ways not just? Is it not your ways that are not just?

## Ezekiel 18:30
“Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, each one according to his ways,” declares the Lord God. “Repent and turn from all your transgressions, so that iniquity will not be your downfall.

## Ezekiel 18:31
Rid yourselves of all the transgressions you have committed, and make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit! Why will you die, O house of Israel?

## Ezekiel 18:32
For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone,” declares the Lord God. “So turn, and live.”
