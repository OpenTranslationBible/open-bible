# Ezekiel Chapter 39

## Ezekiel 39:1

“And you, son of man, prophesy against Gog and say, ‘This is what the Lord God says: Behold, I am against you, Gog, chief prince of Meshech and Tubal;

## Ezekiel 39:2

And I will turn you around, drive you on, take you up from the remotest parts of the north, and bring you against the mountains of Israel.

## Ezekiel 39:3

Then I will strike your bow from your left hand and make your arrows fall from your right hand.

## Ezekiel 39:4

You will fall on the mountains of Israel, you and all your troops and the peoples who are with you; I will give you as food to every kind of predatory bird and animal of the field.

## Ezekiel 39:5

You will fall on the open field; for it is I who have spoken,” declares the Lord God.

## Ezekiel 39:6

“And I will send fire upon Magog and those who live securely in the coastlands, and they will know that I am the Lord.

## Ezekiel 39:7

And I will make My holy name known in the midst of My people Israel, and I will not let My holy name be profaned anymore. Then the nations will know that I am the Lord, the Holy One in Israel.

## Ezekiel 39:8

Behold, it is coming and it shall be done,” declares the Lord God. “That is the day of which I have spoken.

## Ezekiel 39:9

Then those who inhabit the cities of Israel will go out and make fires with the weapons and burn them, both shields and bucklers, bows and arrows, war clubs and spears, and for seven years they will make fires of them.

## Ezekiel 39:10

They will not take wood from the field or gather firewood from the forests, for they will make fires with the weapons. And they will take spoils from those who took spoils from them and seize plunder from those who plundered them,” declares the Lord God.

## Ezekiel 39:11

“And on that day I will give Gog a burial place there in Israel, the valley of those who pass by east of the sea, and it will obstruct those who pass by. So they will bury Gog there with all his horde, and they will call it the Valley of Hamon-gog.

## Ezekiel 39:12

For seven months the house of Israel will be burying them in order to cleanse the land.

## Ezekiel 39:13

And all the people of the land will bury them; and it will be a memorial for them on the day that I appear in My glory,” declares the Lord God.

## Ezekiel 39:14

“And they will designate men on a full-time basis who will pass through the land, burying those who were passing through, those left on the surface of the ground, in order to cleanse it. At the end of seven months they will make a search.

## Ezekiel 39:15

As those who pass through the land pass through and anyone sees a human bone, he will set up a marker by it until the buriers have buried it in the Valley of Hamon-gog.

## Ezekiel 39:16

And even the name of the city will be Hamonah. So they will cleanse the land.”’

## Ezekiel 39:17

“As for you, son of man, this is what the Lord God says: Speak to every kind of bird and to every animal of the field, ‘Assemble and come, gather from every direction to My sacrifice, which I am going to sacrifice for you as a great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel, so that you may eat flesh and drink blood.

## Ezekiel 39:18

You will eat the flesh of warriors and drink the blood of the leaders of the earth, as though they were rams, lambs, goats, and bulls, all of them fattened livestock of Bashan.

## Ezekiel 39:19

So you will eat fat until you are full and drink blood until you are drunk, from My sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.

## Ezekiel 39:20

You will eat your fill at My table with horses and charioteers, with warriors and all the men of war,” declares the Lord God.

## Ezekiel 39:21

“And I will place My glory among the nations; and all the nations will see My judgment which I have executed, and My hand which I have laid on them.

## Ezekiel 39:22

And the house of Israel will know that I am the Lord their God, from that day onward.

## Ezekiel 39:23

The nations will know that the house of Israel went into exile for their wrongdoing, because they were disloyal to Me, and I hid My face from them; so I handed them over to their adversaries, and all of them fell by the sword.

## Ezekiel 39:24

In accordance with their uncleanness and their offenses I dealt with them, and I hid My face from them.”’”

## Ezekiel 39:25

Therefore this is what the Lord God says: “Now I will restore the fortunes of Jacob and have mercy on the entire house of Israel; and I will be jealous for My holy name.

## Ezekiel 39:26

They will forget their disgrace and all their treachery which they perpetrated against Me, when they live securely on their own land with no one to make them afraid.

## Ezekiel 39:27

When I bring them back from the peoples and gather them from the lands of their enemies, then I shall show Myself holy through them in the sight of many nations.

## Ezekiel 39:28

Then they will know that I am the Lord their God, because I made them go into exile among the nations, and then gathered them again to their own land; and I will leave none of them there any longer.

## Ezekiel 39:29

I will not hide My face from them any longer, for I will have poured out My Spirit on the house of Israel,” declares the Lord God.
