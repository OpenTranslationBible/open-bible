# Ezekiel Chapter 39

## Ezekiel 39:1
“And you, son of man, prophesy against Gog and say: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Behold, I am against you, Gog, chief prince of Meshek and Tubal.

## Ezekiel 39:2
I will turn you around and lead you on a rope, bringing you up from the far north and against the mountains of Israel.

## Ezekiel 39:3
I will strike your bow from your left hand and cause your arrows to fall from your right hand.

## Ezekiel 39:4
You will fall on the mountains of Israel, you and all your troops and the nations with you. I will give you as food to every kind of carrion bird and wild animal.

## Ezekiel 39:5
You will fall in the open field, for I have spoken, declares the Sovereign Lord.

## Ezekiel 39:6
I will send fire on Magog and on those who live in safety in the coastlands, and they will know that I am the Lord.

## Ezekiel 39:7
I will make my holy name known among my people Israel and will no longer allow my holy name to be profaned. The nations will know that I am the Lord, the Holy One in Israel.

## Ezekiel 39:8
It is coming! It will surely take place, declares the Sovereign Lord. This is the day I have spoken of.

## Ezekiel 39:9
Then those who live in the towns of Israel will go out and use the weapons for fuel and burn them up—the small and large shields, the bows and arrows, the war clubs and spears. For seven years they will use them for fuel.

## Ezekiel 39:10
They will not need to gather wood from the fields or cut it from the forests, because they will use the weapons for fuel. They will plunder those who plundered them and loot those who looted them, declares the Sovereign Lord.

## Ezekiel 39:11
On that day I will give Gog a burial place in Israel, in the valley of those who travel east of the sea. It will block the way of travellers, because Gog and all his hordes will be buried there. So it will be called the Valley of Hamon Gog.

## Ezekiel 39:12
For seven months the house of Israel will be burying them in order to cleanse the land.

## Ezekiel 39:13
All the people of the land will bury them, and the day I display my glory will be a memorable day for them, declares the Sovereign Lord.

## Ezekiel 39:14
They will appoint men to continually pass through the land, burying those who remain on the surface of the ground, in order to cleanse it. After the seven months they will conduct a search.

## Ezekiel 39:15
As they pass through the land, anyone who sees a human bone will set up a marker beside it until the gravediggers bury it in the Valley of Hamon Gog,

## Ezekiel 39:16
near a town called Hamonah. And so they will cleanse the land.

## Ezekiel 39:17
“Son of man, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: Call out to every kind of bird and all the wild animals: ‘Assemble and come together from all around to the sacrifice I am preparing for you, the great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel. There you will eat flesh and drink blood.

## Ezekiel 39:18
You will eat the flesh of mighty men and drink the blood of the princes of the earth as if they were rams and lambs, goats and bulls—all of them fattened livestock from Bashan.

## Ezekiel 39:19
At the sacrifice I am preparing for you, you will eat fat until you are full and drink blood until you are drunk.

## Ezekiel 39:20
At my table you will eat your fill of horses and riders, mighty men and soldiers of every kind,’ declares the Sovereign Lord.

## Ezekiel 39:21
I will display my glory among the nations, and all the nations will see the judgement I execute and the hand I lay on them.

## Ezekiel 39:22
From that day forward, the house of Israel will know that I am the Lord their God.

## Ezekiel 39:23
And the nations will understand that the house of Israel went into exile for their wrongdoing, because they were unfaithful to me. So I hid my face from them and handed them over to their enemies, and they all fell by the sword.

## Ezekiel 39:24
I dealt with them according to their uncleanness and their offences, and I hid my face from them.

## Ezekiel 39:25
Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I will now restore the fortunes of Jacob and have compassion on all the house of Israel, and I will be zealous for my holy name.

## Ezekiel 39:26
They will forget their shame and all the unfaithfulness they showed towards me when they lived in safety in their land with no one to make them afraid.

## Ezekiel 39:27
When I have brought them back from the nations and gathered them from the lands of their enemies, I will be proved holy through them in the sight of many nations.

## Ezekiel 39:28
Then they will know that I am the Lord their God, for though I sent them into exile among the nations, I will gather them to their own land, not leaving any behind.

## Ezekiel 39:29
I will no longer hide my face from them, for I will pour out my Spirit on the house of Israel, declares the Sovereign Lord.”
