# Ezekiel Chapter 7

## Ezekiel 7:1
Furthermore, the word of the Lord came to me, saying:

## Ezekiel 7:2
“And you, son of man, this is what the Sovereign Lord says to the land of Israel: ‘The end! The end is coming upon the four corners of the land.

## Ezekiel 7:3
Now the end is upon you, and I will unleash My anger against you; I will judge you according to your ways and bring upon you all your abominations.

## Ezekiel 7:4
My eye will not show pity, nor will I spare you. I will repay you for your ways, and your abominations will be among you. Then you will know that I am the Lord.’

## Ezekiel 7:5
This is what the Sovereign Lord says: ‘Disaster! A unique disaster! Behold, it is coming!

## Ezekiel 7:6
The end has come! The end has come! It has awakened against you; behold, it is coming!

## Ezekiel 7:7
Doom has come upon you, you who dwell in the land. The time has come, the day is near—panic rather than joyful shouting on the mountains.

## Ezekiel 7:8
Now I will shortly pour out My wrath upon you and expend My anger against you. I will judge you according to your ways and bring upon you all your abominations.

## Ezekiel 7:9
My eye will not show pity, nor will I spare you. I will repay you according to your ways, while your abominations are in your midst. Then you will know that it is I, the Lord, who strikes.

## Ezekiel 7:10
‘Behold, the day! Behold, it is coming! Doom has burst forth; the rod has budded, arrogance has blossomed.

## Ezekiel 7:11
Violence has arisen, a rod to punish the wicked. None of them shall remain, none of their multitude, none of their wealth, nor anything of value.

## Ezekiel 7:12
The time has come, the day has arrived. Let not the buyer rejoice nor the seller mourn, for wrath is upon all their multitude.

## Ezekiel 7:13
Indeed, the seller will not regain what he sold as long as they both live; for the vision regarding all their multitude will not be averted, nor will any of them maintain his life by his wrongdoing.

## Ezekiel 7:14
‘They have blown the trumpet and made everything ready, but no one will go to battle, for My wrath is against all their multitude.

## Ezekiel 7:15
The sword is outside the city, and plague and famine are within. Those in the field will die by the sword, while famine and plague will consume those in the city.

## Ezekiel 7:16
Even when their survivors escape, they will flee to the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, each for his own wrongdoing.

## Ezekiel 7:17
All hands will hang limp, and every knee will be wet with urine.

## Ezekiel 7:18
They will put on sackcloth, and shuddering will overwhelm them. Shame will be on all faces, and a bald patch on all their heads.

## Ezekiel 7:19
They will fling their silver into the streets, and their gold will become an abhorrent thing. Their silver and gold will not be able to save them on the day of the Lord’s wrath. They cannot satisfy their hunger or fill their stomachs, for their wrongdoing has become a cause of stumbling.

## Ezekiel 7:20
They took pride in their beautiful jewellery and used it to make their detestable idols. They made it into vile images; therefore I will make it an abhorrent thing to them.

## Ezekiel 7:21
And I will hand it over to the foreigners as plunder, and to the wicked of the earth as spoils; and they will defile it.

## Ezekiel 7:22
I will turn My face away from them, and they will profane My treasure; robbers will enter and desecrate it.

## Ezekiel 7:23
‘Prepare chains! For the land is full of bloodshed, and the city is full of violence.

## Ezekiel 7:24
Therefore, I will bring the most wicked of nations to take possession of their houses. I will put an end to the pride of the mighty, and their sanctuaries will be desecrated.

## Ezekiel 7:25
When terror comes, they will seek peace, but there will be none.

## Ezekiel 7:26
Calamity upon calamity will come, and rumour upon rumour. They will seek a vision from a prophet, but the law will be lost from the priest, and counsel from the elders.

## Ezekiel 7:27
The king will mourn, the prince will be clothed with despair, and the hands of the people of the land will tremble. I will deal with them according to their conduct, and by their own standards I will judge them. Then they will know that I am the Lord.’”
