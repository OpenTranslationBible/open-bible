# Ezekiel Chapter 35

## Ezekiel 35:1

The message from the Lord was given to me:

## Ezekiel 35:2

“Son of man, direct yourself towards Mount Seir and prophecy against it,

## Ezekiel 35:3

and say: ‘This is what the Lord God says: Behold, I am against you, Mount Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against you and make you a desolate waste.

## Ezekiel 35:4

I will turn your towns into ruins, and you will become a desolation. Then you will know that I am the Lord.

## Ezekiel 35:5

Because you have harboured an ancient hostility and handed the Israelites over to the sword at the time of their calamity, when their punishment reached its climax,

## Ezekiel 35:6

therefore, as surely as I live, declares the Lord God, I will doom you to bloodshed, and bloodshed will pursue you. Since you did not hate bloodshed, bloodshed will pursue you.

## Ezekiel 35:7

I will make Mount Seir a desolate waste and cut off from it all who pass through and return.

## Ezekiel 35:8

I will fill your mountains with the slain; those killed by the sword will fall on your hills, in your valleys, and in all your ravines.

## Ezekiel 35:9

I will make you a perpetual desolation, and your towns will not be inhabited. Then you will know that I am the Lord.

## Ezekiel 35:10

Because you have said, “These two nations and these two lands will be ours, and we will take possession of them,” even though the Lord was there,

## Ezekiel 35:11

therefore, as surely as I live, declares the Lord God, I will deal with you according to the anger and envy you showed in your hatred of them, and I will make myself known among them when I judge you.

## Ezekiel 35:12

Then you will know that I, the Lord, have heard all the insults you have spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, “They have been laid waste and given to us to devour.”

## Ezekiel 35:13

You have spoken arrogantly against me and multiplied your words against me; I have heard it.

## Ezekiel 35:14

This is what the Lord God says: As the whole earth rejoices, I will make you a desolation.

## Ezekiel 35:15

As you rejoiced when the inheritance of the house of Israel became desolate, so I will do to you. You will be a desolation, Mount Seir, and all of Edom, all of it. Then they will know that I am the Lord.’”
