# Ezekiel Chapter 34

## Ezekiel 34:1

Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying,

## Ezekiel 34:2

“Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel. Prophesy and say to those shepherds, ‘This is what the Lord God says: “Woe to the shepherds of Israel who have been feeding themselves! Should the shepherds not feed the flock?

## Ezekiel 34:3

You eat the fat and clothe yourselves with the wool, you slaughter the fat sheep without feeding the flock.

## Ezekiel 34:4

Those who are sickly you have not strengthened, the diseased you have not healed, the broken you have not bound up, the scattered you have not brought back, nor have you searched for the lost; but with force and violence you have dominated them.

## Ezekiel 34:5

And they scattered for lack of a shepherd, and they became food for every animal of the field and scattered.

## Ezekiel 34:6

My flock strayed through all the mountains and on every high hill; My flock was scattered over all the surface of the earth, and there was no one to search or seek for them.”’”

## Ezekiel 34:7

Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the Lord:

## Ezekiel 34:8

“As I live,” declares the Lord God, “certainly because My flock has become plunder, My flock has even become food for all the animals of the field for lack of a shepherd, and My shepherds did not search for My flock, but rather the shepherds fed themselves and did not feed My flock,”

## Ezekiel 34:9

Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the Lord:

## Ezekiel 34:10

‘This is what the Lord God says: “Behold, I am against the shepherds, and I will demand My sheep from them and make them stop tending sheep. So the shepherds will not feed themselves anymore, but I will save My flock from their mouth, so that they will not be food for them.”’”

## Ezekiel 34:11

For this is what the Lord God says: “Behold, I Myself will search for My sheep and look after them.

## Ezekiel 34:12

As a shepherd cares for his flock on a day when he is among his scattered sheep, so I will care for My sheep and rescue them from all the places where they were scattered on a cloudy and gloomy day.

## Ezekiel 34:13

And I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries and bring them to their own land; and I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the streams, and in all the inhabited places of the land.

## Ezekiel 34:14

I will feed them in a good pasture, and their grazing place will be on the high mountains of Israel. There they will lie down in a good grazing place and feed in rich pasture on the mountains of Israel.

## Ezekiel 34:15

I Myself will feed My flock, and I Myself will lead them to rest,” declares the Lord God.

## Ezekiel 34:16

“I will seek the lost, bring back the scattered, bind up the broken, and strengthen the sick; but the fat and the strong I will eliminate. I will feed them with judgment.

## Ezekiel 34:17

As for you, My flock, this is what the Lord God says: ‘Behold, I am going to judge between one sheep and another, between the rams and the male goats.

## Ezekiel 34:18

Is it too little for you to feed in the good pasture, that you must trample the rest of your pastures with your feet? Or that you drink the clear waters, that you must muddy the rest with your feet?

## Ezekiel 34:19

But as for My flock, they must eat what you trample with your feet and drink what you muddy with your feet!’”

## Ezekiel 34:20

Therefore, the Lord God says this to them: “Behold, I Myself am going to judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep,

## Ezekiel 34:21

Because you push away with your side and shoulder, and gore all the weak with your horns until you have scattered them abroad,

## Ezekiel 34:22

Therefore, I will save My flock, and they will no longer be plunder; and I will judge between one sheep and another.

## Ezekiel 34:23

Then I will appoint over them one shepherd, My servant David, and he will feed them; he will feed them himself and be their shepherd.

## Ezekiel 34:24

And I, the Lord, will be their God, and My servant David will be prince among them; I, the Lord, have spoken.

## Ezekiel 34:25

And I will make a covenant of peace with them and eliminate harmful animals from the land, so that they may live securely in the wilderness and sleep in the woods.

## Ezekiel 34:26

And I will make them and the places around My hill a blessing. And I will make showers fall in their season; they will be showers of blessing.

## Ezekiel 34:27

Also the tree of the field will yield its fruit, and the earth will yield its produce, and they will be secure on their land. Then they will know that I am the Lord, when I have broken the bars of their yoke and rescued them from the hand of those who enslaved them.

## Ezekiel 34:28

And they will no longer be plundered by the nations, and the animals of the earth will not devour them; but they will live securely, and no one will make them afraid.

## Ezekiel 34:29

And I will establish for them a renowned planting place, and they will no longer be victims of famine in the land, and they will not endure the insults of the nations anymore.

## Ezekiel 34:30

Then they will know that I, the Lord their God, am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are My people,” declares the Lord God.

## Ezekiel 34:31

“As for you, My sheep, the sheep of My pasture, you are mankind, and I am your God,” declares the Lord God.
