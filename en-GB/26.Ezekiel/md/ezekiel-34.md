# Ezekiel Chapter 34

## Ezekiel 34:1
A message from the Lord came to me:

## Ezekiel 34:2
“Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel; prophesy and say to them: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Woe to the shepherds of Israel who have been feeding themselves! Should not the shepherds care for the flock?

## Ezekiel 34:3
You consume the fat, clothe yourselves with the wool, and slaughter the best animals, but you do not care for the flock.

## Ezekiel 34:4
You have not strengthened the weak, healed the sick, or bound up the injured. You have not brought back the strays or searched for the lost. Instead, you have ruled them with force and harshness.

## Ezekiel 34:5
So they were scattered for lack of a shepherd, and when they were scattered, they became food for all the wild animals.

## Ezekiel 34:6
My flock wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill; they were scattered over the whole earth, and no one searched or looked for them.

## Ezekiel 34:7
Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the Lord:

## Ezekiel 34:8
As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, because my flock has become plunder and food for all the wild animals, and because my shepherds did not search for my flock but cared for themselves rather than my flock,

## Ezekiel 34:9
therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the Lord:

## Ezekiel 34:10
This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Behold, I am against the shepherds and will hold them accountable for my flock. I will remove them from tending the flock so that they can no longer feed themselves. I will rescue my flock from their mouths, and it will no longer be food for them.

## Ezekiel 34:11
For this is what the Sovereign Lord says: Behold, I will personally search for my sheep and care for them.

## Ezekiel 34:12
As a shepherd looks after his scattered flock when he is with them, so I will care for my sheep and rescue them from all the places where they were scattered on a day of clouds and darkness.

## Ezekiel 34:13
I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries and bring them into their own land. I will pasture them on the mountains of Israel, by the streams, and in all the inhabited places of the land.

## Ezekiel 34:14
I will tend them in a good pasture, and their grazing land will be on the mountain heights of Israel. There they will lie down in a good grazing land and feed in a rich pasture on the mountains of Israel.

## Ezekiel 34:15
I will personally care for my sheep and have them lie down, says the Sovereign Lord.

## Ezekiel 34:16
I will seek out the lost and bring back the strays. I will bind up the injured and strengthen the weak, but I will deal with the sleek and the strong. I will shepherd the flock with fairness.

## Ezekiel 34:17
As for you, my flock, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I will make distinctions between one sheep and another, and between rams and goats.

## Ezekiel 34:18
Is it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture? Must you trample the rest of your pasture with your feet? Is it not enough for you to drink the clear water? Must you muddy the rest with your feet?

## Ezekiel 34:19
Must my flock eat what you have trampled with your feet and drink what you have muddied with your feet?

## Ezekiel 34:20
Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says to them: Behold, I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.

## Ezekiel 34:21
Because you shove with flank and shoulder, butting all the weak sheep with your horns until you have scattered them,

## Ezekiel 34:22
I will rescue my flock, and they will no longer be plundered. I will make distinctions between one sheep and another.

## Ezekiel 34:23
I will appoint over them one shepherd, my servant David, and he will tend them; he will tend them and be their shepherd.

## Ezekiel 34:24
I, the Lord, will be their God, and my servant David will be a leader among them. I, the Lord, have spoken.

## Ezekiel 34:25
I will make a covenant of peace with them and rid the land of savage beasts so that they may live securely in the wilderness and sleep in the forests.

## Ezekiel 34:26
I will make them and the places surrounding my hill a source of blessing. I will send down showers in season; there will be abundant showers of blessing.

## Ezekiel 34:27
The trees will yield their fruit and the ground will yield its crops; the people will be secure in their land. They will recognize that I am the Lord, when I break the bars of their yoke and rescue them from the hands of those who enslaved them.

## Ezekiel 34:28
They will no longer be plundered by the nations, nor will wild animals devour them. They will live securely, and no one will make them afraid.

## Ezekiel 34:29
I will provide for them a land renowned for its crops, and they will no longer suffer from famine in the land or bear the scorn of the nations.

## Ezekiel 34:30
Then they will know that I, the Lord their God, am with them and that they, the house of Israel, are my people, declares the Sovereign Lord.

## Ezekiel 34:31
You are my sheep, the sheep of my pasture, and I am your God, says the Sovereign Lord.’”
