# Ezekiel Chapter 21

## Ezekiel 21:1

And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,

## Ezekiel 21:2

“Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem, and speak against the sanctuaries and prophesy against the land of Israel;

## Ezekiel 21:3

And say to the land of Israel, ‘This is what the Lord says: Behold, I am against you, and I will draw My sword from its sheath and cut off from you the righteous and the wicked.

## Ezekiel 21:4

Because I will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked, therefore My sword will go out from its sheath against all flesh from south to north.

## Ezekiel 21:5

So all mankind will know that I, the Lord, have drawn My sword from its sheath. It will not return to its sheath again.’

## Ezekiel 21:6

As for you, son of man, groan with breaking heart and bitter grief; groan in their sight.

## Ezekiel 21:7

And when they say to you, ‘Why are you groaning?’ you shall say, ‘Because of the news that is coming; and every heart will melt, all hands will be feeble, every spirit will faint, and all knees will drip with water. Behold, it is coming and it will happen,’ declares the Lord God.”

## Ezekiel 21:8

And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,

## Ezekiel 21:9

“Son of man, prophesy and say, ‘This is what the Lord says:

> Say, “A sword, a sword
> sharpened and also polished!

## Ezekiel 21:10

> Sharpened to make a slaughter,
> polished to shine like lightning!”’

Or shall we rejoice, the sceptre of My son rejecting every tree?

## Ezekiel 21:11

> It is given to be polished,
> to be grasped in the hand.
> The sword is sharpened and polished,
> to be put into the hand of the slayer.

## Ezekiel 21:12

> Cry out and wail, son of man,
> for it is against My people;
> it is against all the leaders of Israel.
> They are delivered over to the sword
> with My people,
> therefore strike your thigh.

## Ezekiel 21:13

For there is a testing—what if even the sceptre which the sword despises continues?” declares the Lord God.

## Ezekiel 21:14

> “You therefore, son of man, prophesy
> and clap your hands together;
> and let the sword be doubled
> the third time,
> the sword for the slain!
> It is the sword for the great slaughter
> which surrounds them.

## Ezekiel 21:15

> So that their hearts may melt
> and many fall
> at all their gates,
> I have given the glittering sword.
> Oh, it is made for striking like lightning,
> it is sharpened for slaughter.

## Ezekiel 21:16

> Show yourself sharp, go to the right,
> set yourself;
> go to the left,
> wherever your edge is appointed.

## Ezekiel 21:17

> I also will clap My hands together,
> and I will satisfy My wrath;
> I, the Lord, have spoken.”

## Ezekiel 21:18

The word of the Lord came to me again, saying,

## Ezekiel 21:19

“Now you, son of man, make two ways for the sword of the king of Babylon to come; both of them shall come from the same land. Make a signpost, put it at the head of the road to the city.

## Ezekiel 21:20

You shall mark a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and to Judah, into fortified Jerusalem.

## Ezekiel 21:21

For the king of Babylon stands at the fork of the road, at the head of the two ways, to practice divination; he shakes the arrows, he consults the household idols, he looks at the liver.

## Ezekiel 21:22

Into his right hand came the divination, ‘Jerusalem,’ to set battering rams, to open the mouth for slaughter, to raise the battle cry, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up a siege ramp, to build a wall.

## Ezekiel 21:23

And it will be to them like a false divination in their eyes; they have sworn solemn oaths. But he brings their guilt to remembrance, that they may be seized.

## Ezekiel 21:24

Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: ‘Because you have made your guilt remembered, in that your offenses are uncovered so that your sins are seen in all your deeds—because you have come to remembrance, you will be seized with the hand.’

## Ezekiel 21:25

And you, O slain, wicked one, the prince of Israel, whose day has come, in the time of the punishment of the end,

## Ezekiel 21:26

This is what the Lord God says: ‘Remove the turban and take off the crown; nothing will remain as it was. Exalt the low and humble the exalted.

## Ezekiel 21:27

A ruin, a ruin, a ruin I will make it. This also will be no more until He comes whose right it is, and I will give it to Him.’

## Ezekiel 21:28

And you, son of man, prophesy and say, ‘This is what the Lord God says concerning the sons of Ammon and concerning their reproach.’  
Say:

> ‘A sword, a sword is drawn,
> sharpened for the slaughter,
> to consume,
> to flash like lightning—

## Ezekiel 21:29

> While they see false visions for you,
> while they divine lies for you—
> to place you on the necks
> of the wicked who are slain,
> whose day has come,
> in the time of the punishment of the end.

## Ezekiel 21:30

> Return it to its sheath.
> In the place where you were created,
> in the land of your origin,
> I will judge you.

## Ezekiel 21:31

> I will pour out My indignation on you;
> I will blow on you with the fire of My wrath,
> and I will hand you over to brutal men,
> skilled in destruction.

## Ezekiel 21:32

> You will be fuel for the fire;
> your blood will be in the midst of the land.
> You will not be remembered,
> for I, the Lord, have spoken.’”
