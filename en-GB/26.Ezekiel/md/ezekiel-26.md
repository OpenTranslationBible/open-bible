# Ezekiel Chapter 26

## Ezekiel 26:1

In the eleventh year, on the first day of the month, the message from the Lord came to me:

## Ezekiel 26:2

“Son of man, because Tyre has said regarding Jerusalem, ‘Aha! The gateway of the nations is broken; it has opened to me. Now that she is in ruins, I shall prosper,’

## Ezekiel 26:3

therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: Behold, I am against you, Tyre, and I will bring many nations against you, as the sea brings up its waves.

## Ezekiel 26:4

They will destroy the walls of Tyre and tear down her towers; I will sweep away her debris and make her a bare rock.

## Ezekiel 26:5

Out in the sea she will become a place for the spreading of nets, for I have spoken, declares the Sovereign Lord. She will become plunder for the nations,

## Ezekiel 26:6

and her settlements on the mainland will be slain by the sword. Then they will know that I am the Lord.

## Ezekiel 26:7

For this is what the Sovereign Lord says: Behold, I am going to bring against Tyre Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, king of kings, with horses, chariots, cavalry, and a great army.

## Ezekiel 26:8

He will ravage your settlements on the mainland with the sword; he will set up siege works against you, build a ramp up to your walls and raise a large shield against you.

## Ezekiel 26:9

He will strike your walls with his battering rams and demolish your towers with his weapons.

## Ezekiel 26:10

Because of the multitude of his horses, the dust raised by them will cover you; your walls will tremble at the noise of the cavalry, wagons, and chariots when he enters your gates as men enter a city whose walls have been breached.

## Ezekiel 26:11

With the hooves of his horses he will trample all your streets; he will kill your people with the sword, and your strong pillars will fall to the ground.

## Ezekiel 26:12

They will plunder your wealth and loot your merchandise; they will tear down your walls and demolish your fine houses and throw your stones, timber, and rubble into the sea.

## Ezekiel 26:13

I will put an end to your noisy songs, and the sound of your harps will be heard no more.

## Ezekiel 26:14

I will make you into a barren rock, and you will become a place for spreading fishing nets. You shall not be rebuilt, for I, the Lord, have spoken, declares the Sovereign Lord.

## Ezekiel 26:15

This is what the Sovereign Lord says to Tyre: Will not the coastlands tremble at the sound of your fall, when the wounded groan and the slaughter takes place in your midst?

## Ezekiel 26:16

Then all the princes of the sea will descend from their thrones, remove their robes, and strip off their embroidered garments. Clothed with terror, they will sit on the ground, trembling every moment, appalled at you.

## Ezekiel 26:17

They will take up a lament concerning you and say to you:

> ‘How you are destroyed,
> city of renown,
> peopled by men of the sea!
> You were a power on the seas,
> you and your citizens;
> you put your terror on all who lived there.

## Ezekiel 26:18

> The coastlands now shudder
> on the day of your downfall;
> the islands in the sea
> are dismayed at your collapse.’

## Ezekiel 26:19

For this is what the Sovereign Lord says: When I make you a desolate city, like cities no longer inhabited, and when I bring the ocean depths over you and its vast waters cover you,

## Ezekiel 26:20

then I will bring you down with those who go down to the pit, to the people of old. I will make you dwell in the lower parts of the earth, as in ancient ruins, with those who go down to the pit, so that you will not return or take your place in the land of the living.

## Ezekiel 26:21

I will bring you to a dreadful end, and you will be no more. You will be sought, but you will never again be found, declares the Sovereign Lord.
