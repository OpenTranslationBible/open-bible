# Ezekiel Chapter 26

## Ezekiel 26:1

Now in the eleventh year, on the first of the month, the word of the Lord came to me, saying,

## Ezekiel 26:2

“Son of man, because Tyre has said regarding Jerusalem, ‘Aha! The gateway of the peoples is broken; it has opened to me. I shall be filled, now that she is laid waste,’

## Ezekiel 26:3

Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: ‘Behold, I am against you, Tyre, and I will bring up many nations against you, just as the sea brings up its waves.

## Ezekiel 26:4

They will destroy the walls of Tyre and tear down her towers; and I will scrape her debris from her and make her a bare rock.

## Ezekiel 26:5

She will be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea, for I have spoken,’ declares the Lord God, ‘and she will become plunder for the nations.

## Ezekiel 26:6

Also her daughters who are on the mainland will be killed by the sword, and they will know that I am the Lord.’”

## Ezekiel 26:7

For this is what the Lord God says: “Behold, I am going to bring against Tyre from the north Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, king of kings, with horses, chariots, horsemen, and a great multitude of people.

## Ezekiel 26:8

He will kill your daughters on the mainland with the sword; and he will build a siege wall against you, pile up a mound against you, and raise a large shield against you.

## Ezekiel 26:9

He will direct the blow of his battering rams against your walls, and he will tear down your towers with his axes.

## Ezekiel 26:10

Because of the multitude of his horses, their dust will cover you; your walls will shake from the noise of the horsemen, the wheels, and the chariots when he enters your gates as people enter a city that is breached.

## Ezekiel 26:11

With the hooves of his horses he will trample all your streets. He will kill your people with the sword, and your strong pillars will fall to the ground.

## Ezekiel 26:12

Also they will take your riches and make your merchandise a spoil, tear down your walls and destroy your delightful houses, and throw your stones, your timbers, and your debris into the water.

## Ezekiel 26:13

So I will put an end to the sound of your songs, and the sound of your harps will no longer be heard.

## Ezekiel 26:14

I will turn you into a bare rock; you will be a place for the spreading of nets. You will not be rebuilt, for I the Lord have spoken,” declares the Lord God.

## Ezekiel 26:15

This is what the Lord God says to Tyre: “Will the coastlands not shake from the sound of your downfall when the wounded groan, when the slaughter takes place in your midst?

## Ezekiel 26:16

Then all the princes of the sea will go down from their thrones, remove their robes, and strip off their embroidered garments. They will clothe themselves with trembling; they will sit on the ground, tremble continually, and be appalled at you.

## Ezekiel 26:17

And they will take up a song of mourning over you and say to you,

> ‘How you have perished, you inhabited one,  
> From the seas, renowned city,  
> Which was mighty on the sea,  
> She and her inhabitants,  
> Who imposed terror on all her inhabitants!

## Ezekiel 26:18

> Now the coastlands will tremble
> On the day of your downfall;
> Yes, the coastlands by the sea
> Will be horrified at your passing.’”

## Ezekiel 26:19

For this is what the Lord God says: “When I make you a desolate city, like the cities which are not inhabited, when I bring the deep over you and the great waters cover you,

## Ezekiel 26:20

Then I will bring you down with those who go down to the pit, to the people of old, and I will make you live in the lower parts of the earth, like the ancient ruins, with those who go down to the pit, so that you will not be inhabited. But I will set glory in the land of the living.

## Ezekiel 26:21

I will make you an object of horror, and you will no longer exist. Though you will be sought, you will never be found again,” declares the Lord God.
