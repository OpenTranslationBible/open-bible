# Ezekiel Chapter 29

## Ezekiel 29:1

In the tenth year, in the tenth month, on the twelfth day of the month, the word of the Lord came to me:

## Ezekiel 29:2

“Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him and all of Egypt.

## Ezekiel 29:3

Speak and say, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says:

> “I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt,
> you great monster lying in the midst of your rivers.
> You have said, ‘The Nile is mine; I made it for myself.’

## Ezekiel 29:4

> I will put hooks in your jaws
> and make the fish of your rivers cling to your scales.
> I will draw you up from your rivers,
> with all the fish clinging to your scales.

## Ezekiel 29:5

> I will abandon you in the wilderness,
> you and all the fish of your rivers.
> You will fall on the open field,
> not gathered or picked up.
> I have given you as food
> to the beasts of the earth and the birds of the sky.

## Ezekiel 29:6

Then all the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am the Lord. You have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.

## Ezekiel 29:7

When they grasped you with their hands, you splintered and tore open their shoulders; when they leaned on you, you broke and made all their backs shake.

## Ezekiel 29:8

‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I will bring a sword against you and cut off both man and beast.

## Ezekiel 29:9

The land of Egypt will become a desolate wasteland. Then they will know that I am the Lord. Because you said, ‘The Nile is mine; I made it,’

## Ezekiel 29:10

therefore I am against you and your rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt a ruin and a desolate waste from Migdol to Syene, as far as the border of Cush.

## Ezekiel 29:11

No human foot will pass through it, nor will the foot of an animal pass through it, and it will be uninhabited for forty years.

## Ezekiel 29:12

I will make the land of Egypt desolate among devastated lands, and her cities will lie desolate for forty years among ruined cities. I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them through the countries.

## Ezekiel 29:13

‘For this is what the Sovereign Lord says: At the end of forty years, I will gather the Egyptians from the peoples where they were scattered.

## Ezekiel 29:14

I will restore the fortunes of Egypt and bring them back to the land of Pathros, the land of their ancestry, and there they will be a lowly kingdom.

## Ezekiel 29:15

It will be the lowest of the kingdoms and will never again exalt itself above the other nations. I will make it so weak that it will never again rule over the nations.

## Ezekiel 29:16

Egypt will no longer be a source of confidence for the house of Israel, bringing to mind their guilt in turning to her for help. Then they will know that I am the Sovereign Lord.”’”

## Ezekiel 29:17

In the twenty-seventh year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the word of the Lord came to me:

## Ezekiel 29:18

“Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made his army labour hard against Tyre; every head was rubbed bare and every shoulder made raw. Yet he and his army received no reward from the campaign he led against Tyre.

## Ezekiel 29:19

Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: I am going to give Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will carry off its wealth. He will loot and plunder the land as wages for his army.

## Ezekiel 29:20

I have given him Egypt as a reward for his efforts because he and his army acted for me, declares the Sovereign Lord.

## Ezekiel 29:21

“On that day I will make a horn sprout for the house of Israel, and I will open your mouth among them. Then they will know that I am the Lord.”
