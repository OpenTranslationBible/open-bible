# Ezekiel Chapter 46

## Ezekiel 46:1

‘This is what the Lord God says: “The gate of the inner courtyard facing east shall be shut for the six working days; but it shall be opened on the Sabbath day and opened on the day of the new moon.

## Ezekiel 46:2

The prince shall enter by way of the porch of the gate from outside and stand by the post of the gate. Then the priests shall offer his burnt offering and peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate and then go out. But the gate shall not be shut until evening.

## Ezekiel 46:3

The people of the land shall also worship at the entrance of that gate before the Lord on the Sabbaths and on the new moons.

## Ezekiel 46:4

The burnt offering which the prince shall offer to the Lord on the Sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish;

## Ezekiel 46:5

And the grain offering shall be an ephah with the ram, and the grain offering with the lambs shall be a gift of his hand, as much as he is able to give, and a hin of oil with an ephah.

## Ezekiel 46:6

On the day of the new moon he shall offer a bull without blemish, six lambs, and a ram, all without blemish.

## Ezekiel 46:7

And he shall provide a grain offering, an ephah with the bull and an ephah with the ram, and with the lambs as much as he is able, and a hin of oil with an ephah.

## Ezekiel 46:8

When the prince enters, he shall enter by way of the porch of the gate and go out by the same way.

## Ezekiel 46:9

But when the people of the land come before the Lord at the appointed feasts, the one who enters by way of the north gate to worship shall go out by way of the south gate, and the one who enters by way of the south gate shall go out by way of the north gate. No one shall return by way of the gate by which he entered, but shall go straight out.

## Ezekiel 46:10

And the prince shall be among them when they enter; when they go out, he shall go out.

## Ezekiel 46:11

At the festivals and the appointed feasts the grain offering shall be an ephah with a bull and an ephah with a ram, and with the lambs as much as one is able to give, and a hin of oil with an ephah.

## Ezekiel 46:12

When the prince provides a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings as a voluntary offering to the Lord, the gate facing east shall be opened for him. And he shall offer his burnt offering and peace offerings as he does on the Sabbath day. Then he shall go out, and the gate shall be shut after he goes out.

## Ezekiel 46:13

And you shall provide a lamb a year old without blemish as a burnt offering to the Lord daily; morning by morning you shall provide it.

## Ezekiel 46:14

You shall also provide a grain offering with it morning by morning, a sixth of an ephah and a third of a hin of oil to moisten the fine flour, a grain offering to the Lord continually by an everlasting ordinance.

## Ezekiel 46:15

So they shall provide the lamb, the grain offering, and the oil, morning by morning as a continual burnt offering.”

## Ezekiel 46:16

‘This is what the Lord God says: “If the prince gives a gift from his inheritance to any of his sons, it shall belong to his sons; it is their possession by inheritance.

## Ezekiel 46:17

But if he gives a gift from his inheritance to one of his servants, it shall belong to him until the year of release, then it shall return to the prince. His inheritance shall only belong to his sons; it shall be theirs.

## Ezekiel 46:18

And the prince shall not take from the people’s inheritance by oppression, in order to drive them off from their property; he is to give his sons inheritance from his own property, so that My people will not be scattered, anyone from his property.”’”

## Ezekiel 46:19

Then he brought me through the entrance, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers for the priests, which faced north; and behold, a place was there at the extreme rear toward the west.

## Ezekiel 46:20

And he said to me, “This is the place where the priests shall boil the guilt offering and the sin offering, and where they shall bake the grain offering, so that they do not bring them out into the outer courtyard to transmit holiness to the people.”

## Ezekiel 46:21

Then he brought me out into the outer courtyard and led me across to the four corners of the courtyard; and behold, in every corner of the courtyard there was a small courtyard.

## Ezekiel 46:22

In the four corners of the courtyard there were enclosed courtyards, forty cubits long and thirty wide; these four in the corners were the same in measurement.

## Ezekiel 46:23

And there was a row of masonry all around inside them, around the four of them, and cooking places were made under the rows of stone all around.

## Ezekiel 46:24

Then he said to me, “These are the cooking places where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifices of the people.”
