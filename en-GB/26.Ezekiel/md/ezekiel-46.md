# Ezekiel Chapter 46

## Ezekiel 46:1
‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: The gate of the inner courtyard facing east shall be closed on the six working days, but it shall be opened on the Sabbath day and on the day of the New Moon.

## Ezekiel 46:2
The prince shall enter by the porch of the gate from outside and stand by the gatepost. The priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his fellowship offerings. He shall bow in worship at the threshold of the gate and then go out, but the gate shall not be closed until evening.

## Ezekiel 46:3
The people of the land shall worship at the entrance of that gate before the Lord on the Sabbaths and New Moons.

## Ezekiel 46:4
The burnt offering that the prince brings to the Lord on the Sabbath day shall be six lambs and a ram, all without defect.

## Ezekiel 46:5
The grain offering with the ram shall be an ephah, and the grain offering with the lambs shall be as much as he wishes to give, along with a hin of olive oil for each ephah.

## Ezekiel 46:6
On the day of the New Moon, he shall offer a young bull, six lambs, and a ram, all without defect.

## Ezekiel 46:7
He shall provide a grain offering of one ephah with the bull, one ephah with the ram, and with the lambs as much as he desires, along with a hin of oil for each ephah.

## Ezekiel 46:8
When the prince enters, he shall go in by the porch of the gate, and he shall exit the same way.

## Ezekiel 46:9
When the people of the land come before the Lord at the appointed festivals, whoever enters by the north gate to worship shall exit by the south gate, and whoever enters by the south gate shall exit by the north gate. No one shall return through the gate by which they entered, but each shall go out the opposite gate.

## Ezekiel 46:10
The prince shall be among them, going in when they go in and going out when they go out.

## Ezekiel 46:11
At the feasts and appointed festivals, the grain offering shall be an ephah with a bull, an ephah with a ram, and with the lambs as much as one wishes to give, along with a hin of oil for each ephah.

## Ezekiel 46:12
When the prince provides a freewill offering to the Lord—whether a burnt offering or fellowship offerings—the gate facing east shall be opened for him. He shall offer his burnt offering or his fellowship offerings as he does on the Sabbath day. Then he shall go out, and after he has gone out, the gate shall be shut.

## Ezekiel 46:13
Every day you shall provide a year-old lamb without defect for a burnt offering to the Lord; morning by morning you shall provide it.

## Ezekiel 46:14
You shall also provide with it morning by morning a grain offering, consisting of a sixth of an ephah with a third of a hin of oil to moisten the flour. This grain offering to the Lord is a lasting ordinance.

## Ezekiel 46:15
Thus the lamb, the grain offering, and the oil shall be provided morning by morning for a regular burnt offering.

## Ezekiel 46:16
This is what the Sovereign Lord says: If the prince gives a gift from his inheritance to any of his sons, it shall belong to his descendants; it is to be their property by inheritance.

## Ezekiel 46:17
But if he gives a gift from his inheritance to one of his servants, it shall be his until the year of release; then it shall revert to the prince. His inheritance belongs to his sons only; it is theirs.

## Ezekiel 46:18
The prince must not take any of the inheritance of the people, driving them off their property. He shall give his sons their inheritance from his own property, so that none of my people will be separated from their property.’

## Ezekiel 46:19
Then he brought me through the entrance at the side of the gate to the holy chambers facing north, which belonged to the priests, and showed me a place at the western end.

## Ezekiel 46:20
He said to me, “This is the place where the priests shall cook the guilt offering and the sin offering and bake the grain offering, to avoid bringing them into the outer court and consecrating the people.”

## Ezekiel 46:21
Then he brought me to the outer court and led me around to its four corners, and I saw in each corner another court.

## Ezekiel 46:22
In the four corners of the outer court were enclosed courts, forty cubits long and thirty cubits wide; each of the courts in the four corners was the same size.

## Ezekiel 46:23
Around the inside of each of the four courts was a ledge of stone, with places for fire built all around under the ledge.

## Ezekiel 46:24
He said to me, “These are the kitchens where those who minister at the temple shall cook the sacrifices of the people.”
