# Ezekiel Chapter 28

## Ezekiel 28:1

A message from the Lord came to me,

## Ezekiel 28:2

“Son of man, say to the prince of Tyre, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: “In the arrogance of your heart you proclaim,

‘I am a god;
I occupy the seat of gods in the heart of the seas.’
Yet you are a mortal and not a god,
though you imagine yourself as wise as a god.

## Ezekiel 28:3

Behold, are you wiser than Daniel?
Is no secret too hidden for you?

## Ezekiel 28:4

By your wisdom and understanding
you have acquired wealth for yourself
and gathered gold and silver into your treasuries.

## Ezekiel 28:5

By your great skill in trading
you have increased your riches,
and your heart has become proud because of your wealth.

## Ezekiel 28:6

“‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says:

> ‘Because you have made your heart
> like the heart of a god,

## Ezekiel 28:7

> therefore, behold, I will bring foreigners against you,
> the most ruthless of nations;
> they will draw their swords
> against the beauty of your wisdom
> and defile your splendour.

## Ezekiel 28:8

> They will bring you down to the depths,
> and you will die violently
> in the heart of the seas.

## Ezekiel 28:9

> Will you still say, ‘I am a god,’
> in the presence of those who slay you?
> You will be a mortal, not a god,
> in the hands of those who wound you.

## Ezekiel 28:10

> You will die the death of the uncircumcised
> by the hands of foreigners.

I have spoken, declares the Sovereign Lord.’”

## Ezekiel 28:11

Once more, a message from the Lord came to me,

## Ezekiel 28:12

“Son of man, raise a lamentation over the king of Tyre and say to him: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says:

> “You were the seal of perfection,
> full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.

## Ezekiel 28:13

> You were in Eden, the garden of God;
> every precious stone was your covering:
> carnelian, topaz, and diamond,
> beryl, onyx, and jasper,
> lapis lazuli, turquoise, and emerald.
> Your settings and mountings were crafted in gold;
> on the day you were created
> they were prepared.

## Ezekiel 28:14

> You were the anointed cherub who covers,
> and I placed you on the holy mountain of God;
> you walked among the stones of fire.

## Ezekiel 28:15

> You were blameless in your ways
> from the day you were created
> until wickedness was found in you.

## Ezekiel 28:16

> Through the abundance of your trade
> you were filled with violence,
> and you sinned.
> So I cast you as profane
> from the mountain of God,
> and I destroyed you, O covering cherub,
> from the midst of the stones of fire.

## Ezekiel 28:17

> Your heart was proud because of your beauty;
> you corrupted your wisdom due to your splendour.
> I cast you to the ground;
> I exposed you before kings,
> that they might gaze at you.

## Ezekiel 28:18

> By the multitude of your iniquities,
> in the unrighteousness of your trade,
> you profaned your sanctuaries.
> So I brought forth a fire from within you;
> it consumed you,
> and I turned you to ashes upon the earth
> in the sight of all who beheld you.

## Ezekiel 28:19

> All the nations who knew you
> are appalled at you;
> you have become a horror
> and shall be no more forever.”’”

## Ezekiel 28:20

A message from the Lord came to me,

## Ezekiel 28:21

“Son of man, set your face against Sidon, and prophesy against her

## Ezekiel 28:22

and say, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says:

> “Behold, I am against you, Sidon,
> and I will be glorified in your midst.
> Then they will know that I am the Lord,
> when I execute judgments against her
> and reveal My holiness in her.

## Ezekiel 28:23

> For I will send a plague upon her
> and blood into her streets;
> the slain will fall in her midst
> by the sword on every side.
> Then they will know that I am the Lord.

## Ezekiel 28:24

And there will no longer be for the house of Israel a painful brier or a prickling thorn from any around them who despised them. Then they will know that I am the Sovereign Lord.

## Ezekiel 28:25

‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered, and show Myself holy among them in the sight of the nations, then they will dwell in their own land which I gave to My servant Jacob.

## Ezekiel 28:26

They will live there securely; they will build houses and plant vineyards, and live securely when I execute judgments upon all their neighbours who despised them. Then they will know that I am the Lord their God.’”
