# Ezekiel Chapter 9

## Ezekiel 9:1

Then I heard a loud voice calling out in my presence, “Bring forward those who are appointed to execute judgement on the city, each with a weapon of destruction in his hand.”

## Ezekiel 9:2

And I saw six men coming from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north, each holding a deadly weapon. Among them was a man clothed in linen with a scribe’s kit at his waist. They came in and stood beside the bronze altar.

## Ezekiel 9:3

Now the glory of the God of Israel ascended from the cherubim, where it had been, to the threshold of the temple. Then He called to the man clothed in linen who had the scribe’s kit at his waist.

## Ezekiel 9:4

And the Lord said to him, “Go throughout the city of Jerusalem and mark the foreheads of those who grieve and lament over all the abominations committed in it.”

## Ezekiel 9:5

To the others He said in my hearing, “Follow him through the city and strike; let your eye show no pity and do not spare.

## Ezekiel 9:6

Slaughter the old men, the young men, the maidens, the children, and the women, but do not touch anyone who has the mark. Begin at my sanctuary.” So they began with the elders who were before the temple.

## Ezekiel 9:7

Then He said to them, “Defile the temple and fill the courtyards with the slain. Go out!” So they went out and struck the people in the city.

## Ezekiel 9:8

As they were striking the people and I alone was left, I fell on my face and cried out, saying, “Oh, Lord God! Are You going to destroy the entire remnant of Israel by pouring out Your wrath on Jerusalem?”

## Ezekiel 9:9

Then He said to me, “The guilt of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great, and the land is full of bloodshed, and the city is full of perversion; for they say, ‘The Lord has abandoned the land, and the Lord does not see!’

## Ezekiel 9:10

Yet I will not show pity nor will I spare them, for I will bring their actions upon their own heads.”

## Ezekiel 9:11

Then behold, the man clothed in linen, with the scribe’s kit at his waist, reported, saying, “I have carried out all that You commanded me.”
