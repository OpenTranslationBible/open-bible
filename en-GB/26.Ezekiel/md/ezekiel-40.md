# Ezekiel Chapter 40

## Ezekiel 40:1
In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the start of the year, on the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was captured, on this exact day the hand of the Lord was upon me, and He brought me there.

## Ezekiel 40:2
In the visions of God, He brought me to the land of Israel and set me upon a very high mountain, and on the south side, there was something resembling a city structure.

## Ezekiel 40:3
He brought me there, and behold, there was a man whose appearance was like bronze, with a linen cord and a measuring rod in his hand, and he was standing in the gateway.

## Ezekiel 40:4
The man said to me, “Son of man, observe with your eyes, listen with your ears, and pay attention to everything I am going to show you, for you have been brought here so that I can show it to you. Report to the house of Israel all that you see.”

## Ezekiel 40:5
And behold, there was a wall surrounding the temple area, and the measuring rod in the man’s hand was six cubits long, each cubit being a cubit and a handbreadth. He measured the wall; it was one rod thick and one rod high.

## Ezekiel 40:6
Then he went to the east-facing gate, went up its steps, and measured the threshold of the gate; it was one rod deep.

## Ezekiel 40:7
The guardrooms were one rod long and one rod wide, and there were five cubits between the guardrooms. The threshold of the gate next to the portico facing inward was one rod.

## Ezekiel 40:8
He then measured the portico of the gateway facing inward;

## Ezekiel 40:9
it was eight cubits deep, and its jambs were two cubits thick. The portico of the gateway faced inward.

## Ezekiel 40:10
The east gate had three guardrooms on each side; they all had the same measurements, and the faces of the projecting walls on each side had the same measurements.

## Ezekiel 40:11
He measured the width of the gateway entrance; it was ten cubits, and its length was thirteen cubits.

## Ezekiel 40:12
In front of each guardroom was a barrier wall one cubit high, and the guardrooms were six cubits square.

## Ezekiel 40:13
He measured the gateway from the roof of one guardroom to the roof of the opposite one; the distance was twenty-five cubits from one door to the opposite door.

## Ezekiel 40:14
He measured the side pillars sixty cubits high; the gateway extended all around to the side pillar of the courtyard.

## Ezekiel 40:15
The distance from the entrance of the gateway to the far end of its inner portico was fifty cubits.

## Ezekiel 40:16
There were shuttered windows in the guardrooms and their side pillars within the gateway all around, as well as in the portico. The openings all around faced inward, and the faces of the projecting walls were decorated with palm trees.

## Ezekiel 40:17
Then he brought me into the outer court. There were chambers and a pavement constructed all around the court; thirty chambers faced the pavement.

## Ezekiel 40:18
The pavement, which was the lower pavement, was by the sides of the gateways and corresponded to the length of the gateways.

## Ezekiel 40:19
Then he measured the distance from the front of the lower gateway to the front of the exterior of the inner court; it was a hundred cubits on both the east and north sides.

## Ezekiel 40:20
Then he measured the length and width of the north gate leading into the outer court.

## Ezekiel 40:21
Its guardrooms—three on each side—its side pillars and its portico had the same measurements as those of the first gateway. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.

## Ezekiel 40:22
Its windows, its portico, and its palm tree decorations had the same measurements as those of the gate facing east. Seven steps led up to it, with its portico in front of them.

## Ezekiel 40:23
A gate to the inner court faced the north gate, similar to the one on the east. He measured from one gate to the opposite one; it was a hundred cubits.

## Ezekiel 40:24
Then he led me to the south side, and behold, there was a gate facing south. He measured its side pillars and its portico, and they had the same measurements as the others.

## Ezekiel 40:25
The gateway and its portico had windows all around, like the other windows. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.

## Ezekiel 40:26
There were seven steps leading up to it, and its portico was in front of them; it had palm tree decorations on its side pillars, one on each side.

## Ezekiel 40:27
The inner court also had a gate facing south, and he measured from this gate to the outer gate on the south side; the distance was a hundred cubits.

## Ezekiel 40:28
Then he brought me to the inner court through the south gate, and he measured the south gate; it had the same measurements as the others.

## Ezekiel 40:29
Its guardrooms, its side pillars, and its portico had the same measurements as the others. The gateway and its portico had windows all around. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.

## Ezekiel 40:30
The porticoes of the gateways around the inner court measured twenty-five cubits wide and five cubits deep.

## Ezekiel 40:31
Its portico faced the outer court; palm trees decorated its side pillars, and eight steps led up to it.

## Ezekiel 40:32
Then he brought me to the inner court on the east side, and he measured the gateway; it had the same dimensions as the others.

## Ezekiel 40:33
Its guardrooms, its side pillars, and its portico had the same measurements as the others. The gateway and its portico had windows all around. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.

## Ezekiel 40:34
Its portico faced the outer court; palm trees decorated the side pillars on each side, and eight steps led up to it.

## Ezekiel 40:35
Then he brought me to the north gate and measured it. It had the same dimensions as the others,

## Ezekiel 40:36
as did its guardrooms, its side pillars, and its portico, and it had windows all around. It was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.

## Ezekiel 40:37
Its portico faced the outer court; palm trees decorated the side pillars on each side, and eight steps led up to it.

## Ezekiel 40:38
A chamber with a doorway was by the side pillars at the gates, where they rinsed the burnt offerings.

## Ezekiel 40:39
In the portico of the gateway were two tables on each side, used for the slaughter of burnt offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings.

## Ezekiel 40:40
On the outer side, as one went up to the entrance of the north gateway, were two tables, and on the other side of the portico of the gate were two tables.

## Ezekiel 40:41
So there were four tables on one side of the gateway and four on the other—eight tables in total—on which the sacrifices were slaughtered.

## Ezekiel 40:42
There were also four tables of dressed stone for the burnt offerings, each a cubit and a half long, a cubit and a half wide, and a cubit high. On them were placed the utensils for preparing the burnt offerings and the other sacrifices.

## Ezekiel 40:43
The double-pronged hooks, each a handbreadth long, were attached to the wall all around. The tables were for the flesh of the offerings.

## Ezekiel 40:44
Outside the inner gate, within the inner court, there were chambers for the singers, one of which was at the side of the north gate facing south, and another at the side of the south gate facing north.

## Ezekiel 40:45
He said to me, “The chamber facing south is for the priests who are responsible for the temple,

## Ezekiel 40:46
and the chamber facing north is for the priests who are responsible for the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, who are the only Levites who may draw near to the Lord to minister before Him.”

## Ezekiel 40:47
He measured the courtyard; it was a perfect square, a hundred cubits long and a hundred cubits wide. And the altar was in front of the temple.

## Ezekiel 40:48
He brought me to the portico of the temple and measured the jambs of the portico; they were five cubits wide on each side. The width of the entrance was fourteen cubits, and its projecting walls were three cubits wide on each side.

## Ezekiel 40:49
The portico was twenty cubits wide and eleven cubits from front to back. It was reached by a flight of stairs, and there were columns on each side of the jambs.
