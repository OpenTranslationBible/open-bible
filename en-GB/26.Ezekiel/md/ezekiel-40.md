# Ezekiel Chapter 40

## Ezekiel 40:1

In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was taken, on that same day the hand of the Lord was upon me and He brought me there.

## Ezekiel 40:2

In visions of God He brought me into the land of Israel and set me on a very high mountain, and on it toward the south there was a structure like a city.

## Ezekiel 40:3

So He brought me there; and behold, there was a man whose appearance was like the appearance of bronze, with a thread of flax and a measuring rod in his hand; and he was standing in the gateway.

## Ezekiel 40:4

And the man said to me, “Son of man, see with your eyes, hear with your ears, and pay attention to all that I am going to show you; for you have been brought here so that I might show it to you. Declare to the house of Israel all that you see.”

## Ezekiel 40:5

And behold, there was a wall on the outside of the temple all around, and in the man’s hand was a measuring rod of six cubits, each of which was a cubit and a handbreadth. So he measured the thickness of the wall, one rod; and the height, one rod.

## Ezekiel 40:6

Then he came to the gate which faced east, went up its steps, and measured the threshold of the gate, one rod in width; and the other threshold was one rod in width.

## Ezekiel 40:7

The guardroom was one rod long and one rod wide, and there were five cubits between the guardrooms; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate facing inward was one rod.

## Ezekiel 40:8

Then he measured the porch of the gate facing inward, one rod.

## Ezekiel 40:9

He measured the porch of the gate, eight cubits, and its side pillars, two cubits. The porch of the gate was facing inward.

## Ezekiel 40:10

And the guardrooms of the gate toward the east numbered three on each side; the three were the same in measurement, and the side pillars also were the same on each side.

## Ezekiel 40:11

And he measured the width of the gate opening, ten cubits, and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.

## Ezekiel 40:12

There was a barrier wall one cubit wide in front of the guardrooms on each side; and the guardrooms were six cubits square on each side.

## Ezekiel 40:13

He measured the gate from the roof of the one guardroom to the roof of the other, a width of twenty-five cubits from one door to the opposite door.

## Ezekiel 40:14

He made the side pillars sixty cubits high; the gate extended all around to the side pillar of the courtyard.

## Ezekiel 40:15

From the front of the entrance gate to the front of the inner porch of the gate was fifty cubits.

## Ezekiel 40:16

And there were shuttered windows looking toward the guardrooms, and toward their side pillars within the gate all around, and likewise for the porches. And there were windows all around inside; and on each side pillar were palm tree decorations.

## Ezekiel 40:17

Then he brought me into the outer courtyard, and behold, there were chambers and a stone pavement made for the courtyard all around; thirty chambers faced the pavement.

## Ezekiel 40:18

The pavement, that is, the lower pavement, was by the side of the gates, corresponding to the length of the gates.

## Ezekiel 40:19

Then he measured the width from the front of the lower gate to the front of the exterior of the inner courtyard, a hundred cubits on the east and on the north.

## Ezekiel 40:20

As for the gate of the outer courtyard which faced north, he measured its length and its width.

## Ezekiel 40:21

It had three guardrooms on each side, and its side pillars and its porches had the same measurement as the first gate; its length was fifty cubits and the width twenty-five cubits.

## Ezekiel 40:22

Its windows, its porches, and its palm tree decorations had the same measurements as those of the gate which faced east; and it was reached by seven steps, and its porch was in front of them.

## Ezekiel 40:23

And a gate of the inner courtyard was in front of the gate on the north as well as the gate on the east; and he measured a hundred cubits from gate to gate.

## Ezekiel 40:24

Then he led me toward the south, and behold, there was a gate toward the south; and he measured its side pillars and its porches according to those same measurements.

## Ezekiel 40:25

The gate and its porches had windows all around like those other windows; the length was fifty cubits and the width twenty-five cubits.

## Ezekiel 40:26

There were seven steps going up to it, and its porches were in front of them; and it had palm tree decorations on its side pillars, one on each side.

## Ezekiel 40:27

The inner courtyard had a gate toward the south; and he measured from gate to gate toward the south, a hundred cubits.

## Ezekiel 40:28

Then he brought me to the inner courtyard by the south gate; and he measured the south gate according to those same measurements.

## Ezekiel 40:29

Its guardrooms also, its side pillars, and its porches were according to those same measurements. And the gate and its porches had windows all around; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.

## Ezekiel 40:30

There were porches all around, twenty-five cubits long and five cubits wide.

## Ezekiel 40:31

Its porches faced the outer courtyard; and palm tree decorations were on its side pillars, and eight steps led up to it.

## Ezekiel 40:32

And he brought me into the inner courtyard toward the east. And he measured the gate according to those same measurements.

## Ezekiel 40:33

Its guardrooms also, its side pillars, and its porches were according to those same measurements. And the gate and its porches had windows all around; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.

## Ezekiel 40:34

Its porches faced the outer courtyard; and palm tree decorations were on its side pillars, on each side, and eight steps led up to it.

## Ezekiel 40:35

Then he brought me to the north gate; and he measured it according to those same measurements,

## Ezekiel 40:36

With its guardrooms, its side pillars, and its porches. And the gate had windows all around; the length was fifty cubits and the width twenty-five cubits.

## Ezekiel 40:37

Its side pillars faced the outer courtyard; and palm tree decorations were on its side pillars, on each side, and eight steps led up to it.

## Ezekiel 40:38

A chamber with its doorway was by the side pillars at the gates; there they rinse the burnt offering.

## Ezekiel 40:39

In the porch of the gate were two tables on each side, on which to slaughter the burnt offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering.

## Ezekiel 40:40

On the outer side, as one went up to the entrance of the north gate, were two tables; and on the other side of the porch of the gate were two tables.

## Ezekiel 40:41

Four tables were on each side next to the gate; eight tables on which they slaughter sacrifices.

## Ezekiel 40:42

For the burnt offering there were four tables of cut stone, a cubit and a half long, a cubit and a half wide, and one cubit high, on which they laid the instruments with which they slaughter the burnt offering and the sacrifice.

## Ezekiel 40:43

And the double hooks, one handbreadth in length, were installed in the house all around; and on the tables was the flesh of the offering.

## Ezekiel 40:44

From the outside to the inner gate were chambers for the singers in the inner courtyard, one of which was at the side of the north gate, facing south, and one at the side of the south gate, facing north.

## Ezekiel 40:45

And he said to me, “This is the chamber which faces south, intended for the priests who are responsible for the temple;

## Ezekiel 40:46

But the chamber which faces north is for the priests who are responsible for the altar. They are the sons of Zadok, who from the sons of Levi come near to the Lord to serve Him.”

## Ezekiel 40:47

He measured the courtyard, a perfect square, a hundred cubits long and a hundred cubits wide; and the altar was in front of the temple.

## Ezekiel 40:48

Then he brought me to the porch of the temple, and he measured each side pillar of the porch, five cubits on each side; and the width of the gate was fourteen cubits, and the side walls of the gate were three cubits on each side.

## Ezekiel 40:49

The length of the porch was twenty cubits and the width eleven cubits; and at the stairway by which it was ascended were columns belonging to the side pillars, one on each side.
