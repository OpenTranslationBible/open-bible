# Ezekiel Chapter 17

## Ezekiel 17:1
A message from the Lord came to me:

## Ezekiel 17:2
“Son of man, pose a riddle and present it as a parable to the Israelites.

## Ezekiel 17:3
Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: A mighty eagle with large wings, long feathers, and a full plumage of diverse colours came to Lebanon and took the top of a cedar.

## Ezekiel 17:4
He snapped off the topmost of its young twigs and carried it to a land of merchants; he planted it in a city of traders.

## Ezekiel 17:5
He also took a seedling from the land and placed it in fertile soil, a meadow by abundant waters; he set it like a willow.

## Ezekiel 17:6
It sprouted and became a low, spreading vine. Its branches turned towards him, but its roots remained beneath it. Thus it became a vine, producing branches and sending out leafy boughs.

## Ezekiel 17:7
But there was another great eagle with large wings and much plumage. The vine now sent out its roots towards him and stretched its branches towards him from the bed where it was planted, seeking water.

## Ezekiel 17:8
It had been planted in good soil by abundant waters, so that it might produce branches, bear fruit, and become a splendid vine.’

## Ezekiel 17:9
Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Will it thrive? Will it not be uprooted and stripped of its fruit so that it withers? All its new growth will wither. It will not require a strong arm or many people to pull it up by the roots.

## Ezekiel 17:10
Though it is planted, will it thrive? Will it not completely wither when the east wind strikes it—wither in the bed where it grew?’”

## Ezekiel 17:11
Later, a message from the Lord came to me:

## Ezekiel 17:12
“Say to this rebellious house, ‘Do you not know what these things mean?’ Say: ‘The king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and took its king and nobles, bringing them to Babylon.

## Ezekiel 17:13
He took a member of the royal family and made a covenant with him, putting him under oath. He also carried away the leading men of the land,

## Ezekiel 17:14
so that the kingdom would be humbled, not exalting itself, but maintaining the covenant to survive.

## Ezekiel 17:15
But he rebelled against him by sending his envoys to Egypt for horses and a large army. Will he succeed? Can he break the covenant and escape?

## Ezekiel 17:16
As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign Lord, he shall die in Babylon, in the land of the king who put him on the throne, whose oath he despised and whose covenant he broke.

## Ezekiel 17:17
Pharaoh with his mighty army and great horde will not assist him in war, when ramps are built and siege works erected to destroy many lives.

## Ezekiel 17:18
He despised the oath by breaking the covenant. Despite giving his hand in pledge, he did all these things; he shall not escape.

## Ezekiel 17:19
Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord declares: As surely as I live, I will repay him for disregarding my oath and breaking my covenant.

## Ezekiel 17:20
I will spread my net for him, and he will be ensnared in my trap. I will bring him to Babylon and execute judgment on him there for being unfaithful to me.

## Ezekiel 17:21
All his choice troops will fall by the sword, and the survivors will be scattered to every wind. Then you will know that I, the Lord, have spoken.

## Ezekiel 17:22
This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I myself will take a sprig from the lofty top of a cedar and plant it; I will break off a tender shoot from its topmost branches and plant it on a high and lofty mountain.

## Ezekiel 17:23
On the mountain heights of Israel I will plant it, so that it may produce branches and bear fruit and become a magnificent cedar. Birds of every kind will nest under it; they will find shelter in the shade of its branches.

## Ezekiel 17:24
All the trees of the field will know that I, the Lord, bring down the tall tree and make the low tree grow tall. I dry up the green tree and make the dry tree flourish. I, the Lord, have spoken, and I will do it.”
