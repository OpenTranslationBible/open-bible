# Ezekiel Chapter 20

## Ezekiel 20:1
In the seventh year, in the fifth month on the tenth day, some of the elders of Israel came to seek the Lord, and they sat before me.

## Ezekiel 20:2
Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying:

## Ezekiel 20:3
“Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel and say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says: Have you come to inquire of me? As I live, declares the Lord God, I will not let you inquire of me.’

## Ezekiel 20:4
“Will you judge them, son of man? Make known to them the abominations of their ancestors.

## Ezekiel 20:5
and say to them: ‘This is what the Lord God says: On the day I chose Israel, I swore to the descendants of Jacob and revealed myself to them in Egypt, saying, “I am the Lord your God.”

## Ezekiel 20:6
On that day I swore to bring them out of Egypt into a land I had selected for them, flowing with milk and honey, the most glorious of all lands.

## Ezekiel 20:7
And I said to them, “Each of you, cast away the detestable things your eyes feast on, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.”

## Ezekiel 20:8
But they rebelled against me and were unwilling to listen; they did not cast away the detestable things their eyes feasted on, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt. So I resolved to pour out my wrath on them and unleash my anger against them in Egypt.

## Ezekiel 20:9
But for the sake of my name, I acted to prevent it from being profaned in the sight of the nations among whom they lived, and in whose sight I had revealed myself to the Israelites.

## Ezekiel 20:10
So I led them out of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness.

## Ezekiel 20:11
I gave them my statutes and informed them of my ordinances, by which a person shall live if they obey them.

## Ezekiel 20:12
I also gave them my Sabbaths as a sign between us, so they would know that I, the Lord, sanctify them.

## Ezekiel 20:13
Yet the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness. They did not follow my statutes and rejected my ordinances—by which a person shall live if they obey them—and they greatly profaned my Sabbaths. So I resolved to pour out my wrath on them in the wilderness, to destroy them.

## Ezekiel 20:14
But I acted for the sake of my name, to prevent it from being profaned in the sight of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out.

## Ezekiel 20:15
Also, I swore to them in the wilderness that I would not bring them into the land I had given them—a land flowing with milk and honey, the most glorious of all lands—

## Ezekiel 20:16
because they rejected my ordinances, did not follow my statutes, and profaned my Sabbaths, for their hearts were devoted to their idols.

## Ezekiel 20:17
Yet I looked on them with pity and did not destroy them or bring about their annihilation in the wilderness.

## Ezekiel 20:18
I said to their children in the wilderness, “Do not follow the statutes of your parents or keep their ordinances or defile yourselves with their idols.

## Ezekiel 20:19
I am the Lord your God; follow my statutes and be careful to keep my ordinances.

## Ezekiel 20:20
Sanctify my Sabbaths, and they shall be a sign between us, so that you may know that I am the Lord your God.”

## Ezekiel 20:21
But the children rebelled against me: they did not follow my statutes, nor were they careful to keep my ordinances, by which a person shall live if they obey them, and they profaned my Sabbaths. So I resolved to pour out my wrath on them and unleash my anger against them in the wilderness.

## Ezekiel 20:22
But I withdrew my hand and acted for the sake of my name, to prevent it from being profaned in the sight of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out.

## Ezekiel 20:23
Also, I swore to them in the wilderness that I would disperse them among the nations and scatter them through the countries,

## Ezekiel 20:24
because they had not obeyed my ordinances but had rejected my statutes and profaned my Sabbaths, and their eyes lusted after their parents’ idols.

## Ezekiel 20:25
So I gave them statutes that were not good and ordinances by which they could not live;

## Ezekiel 20:26
I defiled them through their gifts—the sacrifice of every firstborn—that I might fill them with horror so they would know that I am the Lord.’

## Ezekiel 20:27
“Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel and say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says: In this also your ancestors blasphemed me by being unfaithful to me:

## Ezekiel 20:28
When I brought them into the land I had sworn to give them, they saw every high hill and leafy tree, and there they offered their sacrifices and presented their provoking offerings. There they made their soothing aroma and poured out their drink offerings.

## Ezekiel 20:29
Then I said to them: What is this high place you go to?’” (It is called Bamah to this day.)

## Ezekiel 20:30
“Therefore say to the house of Israel: ‘This is what the Lord God says: Will you defile yourselves in the manner of your ancestors and pursue their detestable things?

## Ezekiel 20:31
When you offer your gifts, when you make your children pass through the fire, you continue to defile yourselves with all your idols to this day. Shall I be inquired of by you, house of Israel? As I live, declares the Lord God, I will not be inquired of by you.

## Ezekiel 20:32
And whatever you have in mind will never happen, when you say, “We will be like the nations, like the peoples of the world, serving wood and stone.”

## Ezekiel 20:33
As I live, declares the Lord God, with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with wrath poured out, I will reign over you.

## Ezekiel 20:34
I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you from the lands where you have been scattered, with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with wrath poured out.

## Ezekiel 20:35
I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there I will enter into judgment with you face to face.

## Ezekiel 20:36
As I judged your ancestors in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will judge you, declares the Lord God.

## Ezekiel 20:37
I will make you pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant.

## Ezekiel 20:38
I will purge from you the rebels and those who revolt against me. Although I will bring them out of the land where they reside, they will not enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Lord.

## Ezekiel 20:39
“As for you, house of Israel, this is what the Lord God says: Go, serve each of you your idols; but later you will surely listen to me, and my holy name you will no longer defile with your gifts and idols.

## Ezekiel 20:40
For on my holy mountain, the high mountain of Israel, declares the Lord God, there the entire house of Israel will serve me in the land; there I will accept them and there I will require your offerings and the choicest of your gifts, with all your holy things.

## Ezekiel 20:41
As a soothing aroma I will accept you when I bring you out from the peoples and gather you from the lands where you are scattered, and I will show myself to be holy among you in the sight of the nations.

## Ezekiel 20:42
Then you will know that I am the Lord, when I bring you into the land of Israel, the land I had sworn to give to your ancestors.

## Ezekiel 20:43
There you will remember your ways and all the deeds by which you have defiled yourselves, and you will loathe yourselves for all the evils you have committed.

## Ezekiel 20:44
You will know that I am the Lord, when I have dealt with you for my name’s sake, not according to your evil ways or your corrupt deeds, house of Israel, declares the Lord God.’”

## Ezekiel 20:45
Now the word of the Lord came to me, saying:

## Ezekiel 20:46
“Son of man, set your face toward the south; preach against the south and prophesy against the forest land of the Negev.

## Ezekiel 20:47
Say to the forest of the Negev: ‘Hear the word of the Lord. This is what the Lord God says: Behold, I am about to kindle a fire in you, and it will consume every green tree and every dry tree; the blazing flame will not be quenched, and every face from south to north will be scorched by it.

## Ezekiel 20:48
And all mankind will see that I, the Lord, have kindled it; it will not be quenched.’”

## Ezekiel 20:49
Then I said, “Oh, Lord God! They are saying of me, ‘Is he not just speaking in riddles?’”
