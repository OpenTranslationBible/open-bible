# Ezekiel Chapter 31

## Ezekiel 31:1

In the eleventh year, during the third month, on the first day, the message from the Lord came to me:

## Ezekiel 31:2

“Son of man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his multitudes,

> ‘Who can be likened to you in your greatness?

## Ezekiel 31:3

> Behold, Assyria was like a cedar in Lebanon,
> with lovely branches providing shade to the forest,
> and towering high,
> its top among the clouds.

## Ezekiel 31:4

> The waters nourished it, the deep springs made it grow tall.
> Its streams flowed around its planting place
> and sent channels to all the trees of the field.

## Ezekiel 31:5

> Thus it rose higher than all the trees of the field;
> its boughs multiplied and its branches extended long
> due to the plentiful waters as it spread them out.

## Ezekiel 31:6

> All the birds of the sky nested in its boughs,
> and under its branches all the animals of the field gave birth;
> all the great nations dwelt under its shade.

## Ezekiel 31:7

> It was magnificent in its greatness, with its extensive branches;
> for its roots reached to abundant waters.

## Ezekiel 31:8

> The cedars in God's garden could not rival it,
> nor could the junipers match its boughs,
> nor could the plane trees compare with its branches—
> no tree in God's garden could equal its beauty.

## Ezekiel 31:9

> I made it beautiful with the multitude of its branches,
> and all the trees of Eden in the garden of God envied it.

## Ezekiel 31:10

“‘Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: Because it was exalted in height, and set its top among the clouds, and its heart became proud in its loftiness,

## Ezekiel 31:11

I handed it over to the ruler of the nations, for him to deal with it according to its wickedness. I cast it away.

## Ezekiel 31:12

Foreign tyrants of the nations cut it down and left it; its branches fell on the mountains and in all the valleys, its boughs lay broken in all the ravines of the land. All the peoples of the earth departed from its shade and abandoned it.

## Ezekiel 31:13

All the birds of the sky settled on its fallen trunk, and all the animals of the field took shelter among its branches.

## Ezekiel 31:14

Thus no other trees by the waters will ever tower proudly in height, nor set their tops among the clouds, nor will their well-watered mighty ones stand tall in their height. For they are all consigned to death, to the earth below, among mortals who descend to the pit.

## Ezekiel 31:15

“‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: On the day it descended to Sheol, I brought mourning over it; I covered the deep springs for it, and held back its streams. Its abundant waters were restrained, and I made Lebanon mourn for it, and all the trees of the field withered away.

## Ezekiel 31:16

I made the nations tremble at the sound of its fall when I brought it down to Sheol with those who descend to the pit. Then all the well-watered trees of Eden, the choicest and best of Lebanon, were consoled in the earth below.

## Ezekiel 31:17

They too went down to Sheol with it, to those slain by the sword, along with those who were its strength, who lived in its shade among the nations.

## Ezekiel 31:18

“To which among the trees of Eden can you be compared in glory and greatness? Yet you will be brought down with the trees of Eden to the earth below; you will lie among the uncircumcised, with those slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his hordes, declares the Sovereign Lord.”
