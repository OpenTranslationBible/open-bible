# Ezekiel Chapter 36

## Ezekiel 36:1
“Son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel and declare, ‘O mountains of Israel, listen to the word of the Lord.

## Ezekiel 36:2
This is what the Lord God says: The enemy has said of you, “Aha! The ancient heights have now become ours.”

## Ezekiel 36:3
Therefore, prophesy and say, ‘This is what the Lord God says: Because they have made you desolate and harassed you from every side, you have become a possession of the remaining nations and a subject of malicious talk and slander.

## Ezekiel 36:4
Therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God: This is what the Lord God says to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys, to the desolate ruins and deserted towns that have been plundered and mocked by the nations around you—

## Ezekiel 36:5
therefore, this is what the Lord God says: In the fire of My jealousy I have spoken against the rest of the nations, and against all Edom, who have taken My land as their own with joy and contempt, in order to plunder its pastureland.’

## Ezekiel 36:6
Therefore, prophesy concerning the land of Israel and say to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys: ‘This is what the Lord God says: I have spoken in My jealous wrath because you have endured the insults of the nations.

## Ezekiel 36:7
Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: I have sworn that the nations around you will also endure their own insults.

## Ezekiel 36:8
But you, O mountains of Israel, will produce branches and bear fruit for My people Israel, for they are soon to return.

## Ezekiel 36:9
For indeed, I am for you, and I will turn to you, and you will be tilled and sown.

## Ezekiel 36:10
I will multiply the number of people upon you, the whole house of Israel, all of it; the cities will be inhabited and the ruins rebuilt.

## Ezekiel 36:11
I will increase the number of people and animals upon you, and they will be fruitful and multiply. I will settle people on you as in former times and make you prosper more than before. Then you will know that I am the Lord.

## Ezekiel 36:12
I will cause My people Israel to walk upon you; they will possess you, and you will be their inheritance; you will no longer bereave them of children.

## Ezekiel 36:13
This is what the Lord God says: Because people say to you, “You devour people and bereave your nation of children,”

## Ezekiel 36:14
therefore, you will no longer devour people or bereave your nation of children, declares the Lord God.

## Ezekiel 36:15
I will not let you hear the insults of the nations any longer, nor will you suffer the scorn of the peoples or cause your nation to stumble again, declares the Lord God.’”

## Ezekiel 36:16
The word of the Lord came to me again, saying,

## Ezekiel 36:17
“Son of man, when the house of Israel was dwelling in their own land, they defiled it by their conduct and actions; their way was like the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity before Me.

## Ezekiel 36:18
So I poured out My wrath upon them for the blood they had shed in the land and because they had defiled it with their idols.

## Ezekiel 36:19
I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries; I judged them according to their conduct and actions.

## Ezekiel 36:20
And wherever they went among the nations, they profaned My holy name, for it was said of them, ‘These are the Lord’s people, yet they had to leave His land.’

## Ezekiel 36:21
But I had concern for My holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations where they had gone.

## Ezekiel 36:22
Therefore, say to the house of Israel, ‘This is what the Lord God says: It is not for your sake, O house of Israel, that I am about to act, but for My holy name, which you have profaned among the nations where you have gone.

## Ezekiel 36:23
I will sanctify My great name, which has been profaned among the nations, which you have profaned among them. Then the nations will know that I am the Lord, declares the Lord God, when I am sanctified through you before their eyes.

## Ezekiel 36:24
For I will take you from among the nations, gather you from all the lands, and bring you back into your own land.

## Ezekiel 36:25
I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you will be clean; I will cleanse you from all your impurities and from all your idols.

## Ezekiel 36:26
I will grant you a renewed heart and instill a fresh spirit within you; I will take away your unyielding heart and provide you with a responsive heart.

## Ezekiel 36:27
And I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to follow My decrees and be careful to observe My laws.

## Ezekiel 36:28
Then you will dwell in the land I gave to your forefathers; you will be My people, and I will be your God.

## Ezekiel 36:29
I will save you from all your uncleanness. I will call for the grain and make it abundant, and will not bring famine upon you.

## Ezekiel 36:30
I will increase the fruit of the trees and the produce of the fields, so that you will no longer suffer disgrace among the nations because of famine.

## Ezekiel 36:31
Then you will remember your evil ways and your deeds that were not good, and you will loathe yourselves for your sins and detestable practices.

## Ezekiel 36:32
I want you to know that I am not doing this for your sake, declares the Lord God. Be ashamed and disgraced for your conduct, O house of Israel!

## Ezekiel 36:33
This is what the Lord God says: On the day I cleanse you from all your sins, I will resettle your towns, and the ruins will be rebuilt.

## Ezekiel 36:34
The desolate land will be cultivated instead of lying desolate in the sight of all who pass by.

## Ezekiel 36:35
They will say, ‘This land that was desolate has become like the Garden of Eden; the cities that were ruined, desolate, and destroyed are now fortified and inhabited.’

## Ezekiel 36:36
Then the nations around you that remain will know that I, the Lord, have rebuilt what was destroyed and replanted what was desolate. I, the Lord, have spoken, and I will do it.’

## Ezekiel 36:37
This is what the Lord God says: I will once again respond to the plea of the house of Israel and do this for them: I will increase their people like a flock.

## Ezekiel 36:38
Like the flocks for sacrifices, like the flocks at Jerusalem during her appointed festivals, so will the waste cities be filled with flocks of people. Then they will know that I am the Lord.”
