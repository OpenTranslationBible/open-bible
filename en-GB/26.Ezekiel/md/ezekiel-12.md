# Ezekiel Chapter 12

## Ezekiel 12:1
A message from the Lord reached me,

## Ezekiel 12:2
“Son of man, you are living in the midst of a rebellious house. They have eyes to see but do not see, and ears to hear but do not hear, for they are a rebellious house.

## Ezekiel 12:3
Therefore, son of man, prepare your belongings for exile and go into exile by day in their sight. Move from your place to another place in their sight; perhaps they will understand, though they are a rebellious house.

## Ezekiel 12:4
Bring out your belongings by day in their sight, as baggage for exile. Then you shall go out at evening in their sight, as those going into exile.

## Ezekiel 12:5
In their presence, dig through the wall and take your belongings out through it.

## Ezekiel 12:6
Load your belongings on your shoulder in their sight and carry them out in the dark. Cover your face so that you cannot see the land, for I have made you a sign to the house of Israel.”

## Ezekiel 12:7
So I did as I was commanded. By day I brought out my belongings, packed for exile. Then in the evening I dug through the wall with my hands. I went out in the dark, carrying my belongings on my shoulder while they watched.

## Ezekiel 12:8
In the morning, another message from the Lord reached me,

## Ezekiel 12:9
“Son of man, has not the house of Israel, that rebellious house, said to you, ‘What are you doing?’

## Ezekiel 12:10
Say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: This prophecy concerns the prince in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel who are there.’

## Ezekiel 12:11
Say to them, ‘I am a sign to you.’ Just as I have done, so it will be done to them; they will go into exile, into captivity.

## Ezekiel 12:12
The prince among them will load his belongings on his shoulder in the dark and go out. A hole will be dug in the wall for him to go through. He will cover his face so that he cannot see the land.

## Ezekiel 12:13
I will spread my net for him, and he will be caught in my snare. I will bring him to Babylon in the land of the Chaldeans, yet he will not see it, and there he will die.

## Ezekiel 12:14
I will scatter to the winds all who are around him—his staff and all his troops—and I will pursue them with a drawn sword.

## Ezekiel 12:15
They will recognize that I am the Lord when I disperse them among the nations and scatter them through the countries.

## Ezekiel 12:16
But I will spare a few of them from the sword, famine, and plague, so that they may tell of all their detestable practices among the nations where they go, and they will know that I am the Lord.”

## Ezekiel 12:17
Moreover, another message from the Lord reached me,

## Ezekiel 12:18
“Son of man, eat your bread with trembling and drink your water with quivering and anxiety.

## Ezekiel 12:19
Then say to the people of the land, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says about the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the land of Israel: They will eat their bread with anxiety and drink their water with horror, because their land will be stripped of its fullness due to the violence of all who live there.

## Ezekiel 12:20
The inhabited towns will be laid waste, and the land will become desolate. Then you will know that I am the Lord.’”

## Ezekiel 12:21
Then another message from the Lord reached me,

## Ezekiel 12:22
“Son of man, what is this proverb you have in the land of Israel, saying, ‘The days go by and every vision comes to nothing’?

## Ezekiel 12:23
Therefore say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I will put an end to this proverb, and they will no longer quote it in Israel.’ Tell them, ‘The days are near when every vision will be fulfilled.

## Ezekiel 12:24
For there will be no more false visions or deceptive divinations among the house of Israel.

## Ezekiel 12:25
For I, the Lord, will speak whatever word I speak, and it will be fulfilled without delay. For in your days, you rebellious house, I will speak the word and perform it,’ declares the Sovereign Lord.”

## Ezekiel 12:26
Additionally, another message from the Lord reached me,

## Ezekiel 12:27
“Son of man, behold, the house of Israel is saying, ‘The vision he sees is for many years from now, and he prophesies about the distant future.’

## Ezekiel 12:28
Therefore say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: None of my words will be delayed any longer. Whatever word I speak will be performed,’ declares the Sovereign Lord.”
