## Ezekiel 2:1
He then said to me, “Son of man, stand upon your feet, and I shall speak with you.”

## Ezekiel 2:2
As He spoke, the Spirit entered into me and set me upon my feet, and I heard Him speaking to me.

## Ezekiel 2:3
He said to me, “Son of man, I am sending you to the Israelites, a rebellious nation that has rebelled against Me; they and their forefathers have revolted against Me to this very day.

## Ezekiel 2:4
I am sending you to a people who are impudent and stubborn, and you shall say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says.’

## Ezekiel 2:5
Whether they listen or not—for they are a rebellious house—they will know that a prophet has been among them.

## Ezekiel 2:6
As for you, son of man, do not be afraid of them or their words. Do not fear, even though thistles and thorns surround you and you dwell among scorpions. Do not be dismayed by their words or their presence, for they are a rebellious house.

## Ezekiel 2:7
You are to deliver My message to them, regardless of whether they choose to listen, for they are rebellious.

But you, son of man, hear what I say to you; do not be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth and eat what I provide for you.”

Then I looked, and behold, a hand was extended towards me, and in it was a scroll.

He spread it out before me, and it was written on both sides, with words of lament, mourning, and woe.
