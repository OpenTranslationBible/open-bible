# Ezekiel Chapter 25

## Ezekiel 25:1

The message from the Lord reached me:

## Ezekiel 25:2

“Son of man, set your face against the Ammonites and prophesy against them,

## Ezekiel 25:3

and say to them, ‘Hear the word of the Lord God. This is what the Lord God says: Because you said “Aha!” over my sanctuary when it was desecrated, and over the land of Israel when it was laid waste, and over the people of Judah when they went into exile,

## Ezekiel 25:4

therefore, behold, I am going to hand you over to the people of the East as a possession. They will set up their camps among you and make their dwellings among you; they will eat your fruit and drink your milk.

## Ezekiel 25:5

I will make Rabbah a pasture for camels and Ammon a resting place for flocks. Then you will know that I am the Lord.

## Ezekiel 25:6

For this is what the Lord God says: Because you have clapped your hands and stamped your feet, and rejoiced with all the malice in your heart against the land of Israel,

## Ezekiel 25:7

therefore, behold, I will stretch out my hand against you and give you as plunder to the nations. I will cut you off from the peoples and eliminate you from the lands. I will destroy you, and you will know that I am the Lord.’”

## Ezekiel 25:8

“This is what the Lord God says: ‘Because Moab and Seir said, “Behold, the house of Judah is like all the other nations,”

## Ezekiel 25:9

therefore, behold, I will expose the flank of Moab, beginning with its frontier towns—Beth Jeshimoth, Baal Meon, and Kiriathaim—the glory of the land.

## Ezekiel 25:10

I will deliver Moab along with the Ammonites to the people of the East as a possession, ensuring that the Ammonites are forgotten among the nations;

## Ezekiel 25:11

and I will execute judgments on Moab. Then they will know that I am the Lord.’”

## Ezekiel 25:12

“This is what the Lord God says: ‘Because Edom acted in vengeance against the house of Judah and incurred great guilt by doing so,

## Ezekiel 25:13

therefore this is what the Lord God says: I will stretch out my hand against Edom and eliminate both man and beast. I will lay it waste, and from Teman to Dedan they will fall by the sword.

## Ezekiel 25:14

I will take my vengeance on Edom by the hand of my people Israel, and they will deal with Edom according to my anger and my wrath; they will know my vengeance, declares the Lord God.’”

## Ezekiel 25:15

“This is what the Lord God says: ‘Because the Philistines acted in revenge and took vengeance with malice in their hearts, and with ancient hostility sought to destroy Judah,

## Ezekiel 25:16

therefore this is what the Lord God says: Behold, I am about to stretch out my hand against the Philistines and eliminate the Cherethites; and I will destroy the remnant along the coast.

## Ezekiel 25:17

I will carry out great vengeance on them with furious rebukes; and they will know that I am the Lord, when I bring my vengeance upon them.’”
