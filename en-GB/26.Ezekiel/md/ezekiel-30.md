# Ezekiel Chapter 30

## Ezekiel 30:1

The word of the Lord came to me, saying:

## Ezekiel 30:2

“Son of man, prophesy and declare: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says:

> “Wail,
> ‘Alas for that day!’

## Ezekiel 30:3

> For the day is near,
> indeed, the day of the Lord is near;
> a day of clouds,
> a time of doom for the nations.

## Ezekiel 30:4

> A sword will come upon Egypt,
> and there will be anguish in Cush.
> When the slain fall in Egypt,
> her wealth will be carried away,
> and her foundations will be torn down.

## Ezekiel 30:5

Cush, Put, Lud, all Arabia, Libya, and the people of the covenant land will fall by the sword along with Egypt.

## Ezekiel 30:6

‘This is what the Lord says:

> “The allies of Egypt will fall
> and the pride of her power will be brought down.
> From Migdol to Syene they will fall by the sword within her,”
> declares the Sovereign Lord.

## Ezekiel 30:7

> “They will be desolate
> among desolate lands,
> and their cities will lie
> among devastated cities.

## Ezekiel 30:8

> Then they will know that I am the Lord,
> when I set fire to Egypt
> and all her helpers are broken.

## Ezekiel 30:9

On that day messengers will go out from me in ships to frighten Cush out of her complacency; trembling will seize them on the day of Egypt’s doom, for it is surely coming.

## Ezekiel 30:10

‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says:

> “I will put an end to the hordes of Egypt
> by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.

## Ezekiel 30:11

> He and his people with him,
> the most ruthless of nations,
> will be brought in to destroy the land.
> They will draw their swords against Egypt
> and fill the land with the slain.

## Ezekiel 30:12

> I will dry up the waters of the Nile
> and sell the land into the hands of evil men;
> by the hand of foreigners I will lay waste the land
> and all that is in it.

I the Lord have spoken.

## Ezekiel 30:13

‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says:

> “I will destroy the idols
> and put an end to the images in Memphis.
> There will no longer be a prince in Egypt,
> and I will spread fear throughout the land.

## Ezekiel 30:14

> I will lay waste Pathros,
> set fire to Zoan,
> and inflict punishment on Thebes.

## Ezekiel 30:15

> I will pour out my wrath on Pelusium,
> the stronghold of Egypt,
> and eliminate the hordes of Thebes.

## Ezekiel 30:16

> I will set fire to Egypt;
> Pelusium will writhe in agony,
> Thebes will be breached,
> and Memphis will be in constant distress.

## Ezekiel 30:17

> The young men of Heliopolis and Bubastis
> will fall by the sword,
> and the women will go into captivity.

## Ezekiel 30:18

> Dark will be the day at Tahpanhes
> when I break the yoke of Egypt;
> there her proud strength will come to an end.
> She will be covered with clouds,
> and her daughters will go into captivity.

## Ezekiel 30:19

> So I will execute judgments on Egypt,
> and they will know that I am the Lord.’”

## Ezekiel 30:20

In the eleventh year, in the first month on the seventh day, the word of the Lord came to me, saying:

## Ezekiel 30:21

“Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt. It has not been bound up for healing or wrapped with a bandage, so that it may be strong enough to wield the sword.

## Ezekiel 30:22

Therefore this is what the Sovereign Lord says: ‘Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and I will break both his arms, the strong one as well as the broken one, and make the sword fall from his hand.

## Ezekiel 30:23

I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them throughout the lands.

## Ezekiel 30:24

I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon and put my sword in his hand, but I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he will groan before him like a mortally wounded man.

## Ezekiel 30:25

I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, but the arms of Pharaoh will fall limp. Then they will know that I am the Lord, when I put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon and he brandishes it against the land of Egypt.

## Ezekiel 30:26

When I scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them throughout the lands, then they will know that I am the Lord.’”
