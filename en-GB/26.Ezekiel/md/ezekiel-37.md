# Ezekiel Chapter 37

## Ezekiel 37:1
The hand of the Lord was upon me, and He brought me out by the Spirit of the Lord and placed me in the centre of a valley; it was filled with bones.

## Ezekiel 37:2
He led me around among them, and I observed a large number of bones on the surface of the valley; indeed, they were very dry.

## Ezekiel 37:3
He asked me, “Son of man, can these bones live?” I replied, “Sovereign Lord, only You know.”

## Ezekiel 37:4
Then He instructed me, “Prophesy over these bones and tell them, ‘Dry bones, hear the word of the Lord.’

## Ezekiel 37:5
This is what the Sovereign Lord says to these bones: ‘I will cause breath to enter you, and you shall live.

## Ezekiel 37:6
I will attach tendons to you, grow flesh upon you, cover you with skin, and put breath in you so that you may live. Then you will know that I am the Lord.’”

## Ezekiel 37:7
So I prophesied as I was commanded. As I was prophesying, there was a sound, a rattling, and the bones came together, bone to its bone.

## Ezekiel 37:8
I looked, and tendons and flesh appeared on them, and skin covered them; but there was no breath in them.

## Ezekiel 37:9
Then He said to me, “Prophesy to the breath, prophesy, son of man, and say to it, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Come from the four winds, breath, and breathe into these slain, that they may live.’”

## Ezekiel 37:10
So I prophesied as He commanded me, and breath entered them; they came to life and stood on their feet, an exceedingly great army.

## Ezekiel 37:11
Then He said to me, “Son of man, these bones represent the whole house of Israel. They say, ‘Our bones are dried up, our hope is lost; we are completely cut off.’

## Ezekiel 37:12
Therefore prophesy and say to them: ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: My people, I am going to open your graves and bring you up from them; I will return you to the land of Israel.

## Ezekiel 37:13
Then you, my people, will know that I am the Lord, when I open your graves and bring you up from them.

## Ezekiel 37:14
I will put my Spirit within you, and you shall live, and I will settle you in your own land. Then you will know that I, the Lord, have spoken and have done it,’ declares the Lord.”

## Ezekiel 37:15
The word of the Lord came to me again:

## Ezekiel 37:16
“Son of man, take a stick and write on it, ‘For Judah and the Israelites associated with him.’ Then take another stick and write on it, ‘For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and all the house of Israel associated with him.’

## Ezekiel 37:17
Join them together into one stick so that they become one in your hand.

## Ezekiel 37:18
When your people ask you, ‘Will you not tell us what you mean by this?’

## Ezekiel 37:19
say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I am going to take the stick of Joseph, which is in Ephraim’s hand, and the tribes of Israel associated with him, and join it with the stick of Judah. I will make them one stick, and they will be one in My hand.’

## Ezekiel 37:20
Hold the sticks on which you have written before their eyes.

## Ezekiel 37:21
And say to them, ‘This is what the Sovereign Lord says: I will take the Israelites from among the nations where they have gone, and I will gather them from every side and bring them back to their own land.

## Ezekiel 37:22
I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel; and there will be one king over all of them. They will no longer be two nations, nor will they be divided into two kingdoms.

## Ezekiel 37:23
They will no longer defile themselves with their idols, or with their detestable things, or with any of their sins. I will save them from all their backslidings in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them. They will be My people, and I will be their God.

## Ezekiel 37:24
“My servant David will be king over them, and they will all have one shepherd. They will follow My laws and be careful to keep My decrees.

## Ezekiel 37:25
They will dwell in the land I gave to My servant Jacob, where your ancestors lived. They, their children, and their children’s children will live there forever, and My servant David will be their prince forever.

## Ezekiel 37:26
I will make a covenant of peace with them; it will be an everlasting covenant. I will establish them and multiply them, and I will set My sanctuary among them forever.

## Ezekiel 37:27
My dwelling place will be with them; I will be their God, and they will be My people.

## Ezekiel 37:28
Then the nations will know that I, the Lord, make Israel holy, when My sanctuary is among them forever.’”
