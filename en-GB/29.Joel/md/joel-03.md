## Joel 3:1

> “In that period, when I bring back the prosperity of Judah and Jerusalem,

## Joel 3:2

> I will gather all the nations
> and bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat.
> There I will enter into judgement with them
> on behalf of my people and my inheritance, Israel,
> whom they have scattered among the nations
> and divided my land.

## Joel 3:3

> They cast lots for my people,
> traded a boy for a prostitute,
> and sold a girl for wine to drink.

## Joel 3:4

“Now what are you to me, Tyre, Sidon, and all the regions of Philistia? Are you repaying me for something? If you are paying me back, I will swiftly and speedily return your retribution on your own heads.

## Joel 3:5

For you took my silver and my gold and brought my finest treasures to your temples.

## Joel 3:6

You sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks, to remove them far from their homeland.

## Joel 3:7

“See, I am going to rouse them from the places where you sold them, and return your retribution on your own heads.

## Joel 3:8

I will sell your sons and daughters into the hands of the people of Judah, and they will sell them to the Sabeans, a nation far away,” for the Lord has spoken.

## Joel 3:9

> Proclaim this among the nations:
> Prepare for war!
> Stir up the warriors!
> Let all the soldiers come forward and attack.

## Joel 3:10

> Transform your ploughshares into swords
> and your pruning hooks into spears.
> Let the weakling declare, “I am strong!”

## Joel 3:11

> Come quickly, all you surrounding nations,
> and gather yourselves there.
> Bring down, Lord, your warriors.

## Joel 3:12

> Let the nations be awakened
> and advance to the Valley of Jehoshaphat,
> for there I will sit to judge
> all the surrounding nations.

## Joel 3:13

> Swing the sickle, for the harvest is ripe.
> Come, trample the grapes, for the winepress is full
> and the vats overflow—so great is their wickedness!

## Joel 3:14

> Crowds upon crowds in the valley of decision!
> For the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision.

## Joel 3:15

> The sun and moon will be darkened,
> and the stars will lose their brightness.

## Joel 3:16

> The Lord will roar from Zion
> and thunder from Jerusalem;
> the heavens and the earth will tremble.
> But the Lord will be a refuge for his people,
> a stronghold for the sons of Israel.

## Joel 3:17

> “Then you will know that I am the Lord your God,
> dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain.
> Jerusalem will be holy;
> never again will strangers pass through her.

## Joel 3:18

> “In that day the mountains will drip with sweet wine,
> and the hills will flow with milk;
> all the brooks of Judah will run with water.
> A fountain will flow out of the Lord’s house
> and will water the Valley of Shittim.

## Joel 3:19

> But Egypt will become a wasteland,
> and Edom a desolate wilderness,
> because of the violence done to the people of Judah,
> in whose land they shed innocent blood.

## Joel 3:20

> But Judah will be inhabited forever,
> and Jerusalem through all generations.

## Joel 3:21

> Shall I leave their innocent blood unavenged? No, I will not.”

For the Lord dwells in Zion!
