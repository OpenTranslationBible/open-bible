# Joel Chapter 3

## Joel 3:1

> For behold, in those days and at that time,  
> When I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,

## Joel 3:2

> I will gather all the nations  
> And bring them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat.  
> Then I will enter into judgment with them there  
> On behalf of My people and My inheritance, Israel,  
> Whom they have scattered among the nations;  
> And they have divided up My land.

## Joel 3:3

> They have also cast lots for My people,  
> Traded a boy for a prostitute,  
> And sold a girl for wine so that they may drink.

## Joel 3:4

Moreover, what are you to Me, Tyre, Sidon,  
And all the regions of Philistia?  
Are you repaying Me with retribution?  
But if you are retaliating against Me,  
I will swiftly and promptly return your retribution on your head!

## Joel 3:5

Since you have taken My silver and My gold,  
Brought My precious treasures to your temples,

## Joel 3:6

And sold the sons of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks  
In order to remove them far from their territory,

## Joel 3:7

Behold, I am going to stir them up from the place where you have sold them,  
And return your retribution on your head.

## Joel 3:8

I will also sell your sons and your daughters  
Into the hands of the sons of Judah,  
And they will sell them to the Sabeans,  
To a distant nation,” for the Lord has spoken.

## Joel 3:9

> Proclaim this among the nations:  
> Prepare for holy war;  
> Stir up the warriors!  
> Have all the soldiers come forward, have them come up!

## Joel 3:10

> Beat your ploughshares into swords,  
> And your pruning hooks into spears;  
> Let the weak say, “I am a warrior.”

## Joel 3:11

> Hurry and come, all you surrounding nations,  
> And gather yourselves there.  
> Bring down, Lord, Your warriors.

## Joel 3:12

> Let the nations be awakened  
> And come up to the Valley of Jehoshaphat,  
> For there I will sit to judge  
> All the surrounding nations.

## Joel 3:13

> Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe.  
> Come, tread the grapes, for the wine press is full;  
> The vats overflow, for their wickedness is great.

## Joel 3:14

> Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision!  
> For the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision.

## Joel 3:15

> The sun and moon have become dark,  
> And the stars have lost their brightness.

## Joel 3:16

> The Lord roars from Zion,  
> And utters His voice from Jerusalem,  
> And the heavens and the earth quake.  
> But the Lord is a refuge for His people,  
> And a stronghold for the sons of Israel.

## Joel 3:17

> Then you will know that I am the Lord your God,  
> Dwelling on Zion, My holy mountain.  
> So Jerusalem will be holy,  
> And strangers will no longer pass through it.

## Joel 3:18

> And on that day  
> The mountains will drip with sweet wine,  
> The hills will flow with milk,  
> And all the brooks of Judah will flow with water;  
> And a spring will go out from the house of the Lord  
> And water the Valley of Shittim.

## Joel 3:19

> Egypt will become a desolation,  
> And Edom will become a desolate wilderness,  
> Because of the violence done to the sons of Judah,  
> In whose land they have shed innocent blood.

## Joel 3:20

> But Judah will be inhabited forever,  
> And Jerusalem for all generations.

## Joel 3:21

> And I will avenge their blood which I have not avenged,

For the Lord dwells in Zion.
