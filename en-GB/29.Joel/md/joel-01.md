# Joel Chapter 1

## Joel 1:1

Then the word of the Lord came to Joel, son of Pethuel.

## Joel 1:2

> Hear this, you elders,
> and listen, all who dwell in the land.
> Has anything like this happened in your days
> or in the days of your forefathers?

## Joel 1:3

> Share this with your children,
> and let them share it with their children,
> and their descendants with the following generation.

## Joel 1:4

> What the gnawing locust left, the swarming locust has eaten;
> what the swarming locust left, the creeping locust has eaten;
> what the creeping locust left, the stripping locust has eaten.

## Joel 1:5

> Awake, you drunkards, and weep!
> Wail, all you wine drinkers,
> because of the sweet wine,
> for it has been taken from your lips.

## Joel 1:6

> For a nation has invaded my land,
> powerful and beyond number;
> it has the teeth of a lion
> and the fangs of a lioness.

## Joel 1:7

> It has laid waste my vine
> and turned my fig tree into a stump.
> It has stripped off their bark and cast it away,
> leaving their branches white.

## Joel 1:8

> Mourn like a young woman in sackcloth
> grieving for the husband of her youth.

## Joel 1:9

> The grain offerings and drink offerings are cut off
> from the house of the Lord.
> The priests mourn,
> those who minister before the Lord.

## Joel 1:10

> The fields are devastated,
> the land mourns;
> for the grain is destroyed,
> the new wine has dried up,
> and the olive oil fails.

## Joel 1:11

> Despair, you farmers,
> wail, you vinedressers,
> for the wheat and the barley,
> because the harvest of the field is ruined.

## Joel 1:12

> The vine is dried up
> and the fig tree withered;
> the pomegranate, the palm, and the apple treeâ€”
> all the trees of the fieldâ€”are dried up.
> Indeed, the joy of mankind has withered away.

## Joel 1:13

> Put on sackcloth and lament, you priests;
> wail, you who minister at the altar.
> Come, spend the night in sackcloth,
> you who minister to my God,
> for the grain offerings and drink offerings
> are withheld from the house of your God.

## Joel 1:14

> Declare a holy fast;
> call a sacred assembly.
> Gather the elders
> and all who live in the land
> to the house of the Lord your God,
> and cry out to the Lord.

## Joel 1:15

> Alas for the day!
> For the day of the Lord is near;
> it will come as destruction from the Almighty.

## Joel 1:16

> Is not the food removed before our eyes,
> and joy and gladness from the house of our God?

## Joel 1:17

> The seeds lie shrivelled beneath the soil;
> the storehouses are in ruins,
> the granaries have been broken down,
> for the grain has dried up.

## Joel 1:18

> How the cattle moan!
> The herds wander aimlessly
> because they have no pasture;
> even the flocks of sheep suffer.

## Joel 1:19

> To you, Lord, I call,
> for fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness
> and flames have burned up all the trees of the field.

## Joel 1:20

> Even the wild animals pant for you;
> the streams of water have dried up,
> and fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.
