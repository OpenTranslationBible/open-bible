# Joel Chapter 1

## Joel 1:1

The word of the Lord that came to Joel, the son of Pethuel:

## Joel 1:2

> Hear this, you elders,  
> And listen, all inhabitants of the land.  
> Has anything like this happened in your days,  
> Or in your fathersâ€™ days?

## Joel 1:3

> Tell your sons about it,  
> And have your sons tell their sons,  
> And their sons the next generation.

## Joel 1:4

> What the gnawing locust has left, the swarming locust has eaten;  
> And what the swarming locust has left, the creeping locust has eaten;  
> And what the creeping locust has left, the stripping locust has eaten.

## Joel 1:5

> Wake up, you heavy drinkers, and weep;  
> Wail, all you wine drinkers,  
> Because of the sweet wine,  
> For it has been eliminated from your mouth.

## Joel 1:6

> For a nation has invaded My land,  
> Mighty and without number;  
> Its teeth are the teeth of a lion,  
> And it has the fangs of a lioness.

## Joel 1:7

> It has made My vine a waste,  
> And My fig tree splinters.  
> It has stripped them bare and thrown them away;  
> Their branches have turned white.

## Joel 1:8

> Wail like a virgin clothed with sackcloth  
> For the groom of her youth.

## Joel 1:9

> The grain offering and the drink offering have been cut off  
> From the house of the Lord.  
> The priests mourn,  
> The ministers of the Lord.

## Joel 1:10

> The field is ruined,  
> The land mourns;  
> For the grain is ruined,  
> The new wine has dried up,  
> Fresh oil has failed.

## Joel 1:11

> Be ashamed, you farmers,  
> Wail, you vinedressers,  
> For the wheat and the barley,  
> Because the harvest of the field is destroyed.

## Joel 1:12

> The vine has dried up,  
> And the fig tree has failed;  
> The pomegranate, the palm also, and the apple tree,  
> All the trees of the field have dried up.  
> Indeed, joy has dried up  
> From the sons of mankind.

## Joel 1:13

> Put on sackcloth and mourn, you priests;  
> Wail, you ministers of the altar!  
> Come, spend the night in sackcloth,  
> You ministers of my God,  
> For the grain offering and the drink offering  
> Have been withheld from the house of your God.

## Joel 1:14

> Consecrate a fast,  
> Proclaim a solemn assembly;  
> Gather the elders  
> And all the inhabitants of the land  
> To the house of the Lord your God,  
> And cry out to the Lord.

## Joel 1:15

> Woe for the day!  
> For the day of the Lord is near,  
> And it will come as destruction from the Almighty.

## Joel 1:16

> Has food not been cut off before our eyes,  
> And joy and jubilation from the house of our God?

## Joel 1:17

> The seeds shrivel under their clods;  
> The storehouses are desolate,  
> The barns are torn down,  
> Because the grain has dried up.

## Joel 1:18

> How the animals groan!  
> The herds of cattle wander aimlessly  
> Because there is no pasture for them;  
> Even the flocks of sheep suffer.

## Joel 1:19

> To You, Lord, I cry out;  
> For fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness,  
> And the flame has burned up all the trees of the field.

## Joel 1:20

> Even the animals of the field pant for You;  
> For the stream beds of water are dried up,  
> And fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.
