# Joel Chapter 2

## Joel 2:1

> Blow a trumpet in Zion,  
> And sound an alarm on My holy mountain!  
> Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble,  
> For the day of the Lord is coming;  
> Indeed, it is near,

## Joel 2:2

> A day of darkness and gloom,  
> A day of clouds and thick darkness.  
> As dawn is spread over the mountains,  
> So there is a great and mighty people;  
> There has never been anything like it,  
> Nor will there be again after it  
> To the years of many generations.

## Joel 2:3

> A fire consumes before them,  
> And behind them a flame devours.  
> The land is like the Garden of Eden before them,  
> But a desolate wilderness behind them,  
> And nothing at all escapes them.

## Joel 2:4

> Their appearance is like the appearance of horses;  
> And like war horses, so they run.

## Joel 2:5

> With a noise as of chariots  
> They leap about on the tops of the mountains,  
> Like the crackling of a flame of fire consuming the stubble,  
> Like a mighty people drawn up for battle.

## Joel 2:6

> Before them the people are in anguish;  
> All faces turn pale.

## Joel 2:7

> They run like warriors,  
> They climb the wall like soldiers;  
> And each of them marches in line,  
> Nor do they lose their way.

## Joel 2:8

> They do not crowd each other,  
> Every warrior of them marches in his path;  
> When they burst through the defences,  
> They do not break ranks.

## Joel 2:9

> They storm the city,  
> They run on the wall;  
> They climb into the houses,  
> They enter through the windows like a thief.

## Joel 2:10

> Before them the earth quakes,  
> The heavens tremble,  
> The sun and the moon become dark,  
> And the stars lose their brightness.

## Joel 2:11

> The Lord utters His voice before His army;  
> His camp is indeed very great,  
> For mighty is one who carries out His word.  
> The day of the Lord is indeed great and very awesome,  
> And who can endure it?

## Joel 2:12

> “Yet even now,” declares the Lord,  
> “Return to Me with all your heart,  
> And with fasting, weeping, and mourning;

## Joel 2:13

> And tear your heart and not merely your garments.”  
> Now return to the Lord your God,  
> For He is gracious and compassionate,  
> Slow to anger, abounding in mercy  
> And relenting of catastrophe.

## Joel 2:14

> Who knows, He might turn and relent,  
> And leave a blessing behind Him,  
> Even a grain offering and a drink offering  
> For the Lord your God.

## Joel 2:15

> Blow a trumpet in Zion,  
> Consecrate a fast,  
> Proclaim a solemn assembly,

## Joel 2:16

> Gather the people,  
> Sanctify the congregation,  
> Assemble the elders,  
> Gather the children and the nursing infants.  
> Have the groom come out of his room  
> And the bride out of her bridal chamber.

## Joel 2:17

> Let the priests, the Lord’s ministers,  
> Weep between the porch and the altar,  
> And let them say,  
> “Spare Your people, Lord,  
> And do not make Your inheritance a disgrace,  
> With the nations jeering at them.  
> Why should those among the peoples say,  
> ‘Where is their God?’”

## Joel 2:18

Then the Lord will be zealous for His land,  
And will have compassion for His people.

## Joel 2:19

The Lord will answer and say to His people,

> “Behold, I am going to send you grain, new wine, and oil,  
> And you will be satisfied in full with them;  
> And I will no longer make you a disgrace among the nations.

## Joel 2:20

> But I will remove the northern army far from you,  
> And I will drive it into a dry and desolate land,  
> Its vanguard into the eastern sea,  
> And its rear guard into the western sea.  
> And its stench will ascend and its foul smell will come up,  
> For it has done great things.”

## Joel 2:21

> Do not fear, land;  
> Shout for joy and rejoice,  
> For the Lord has done great things.

## Joel 2:22

> Do not fear, animals of the field,  
> For the pastures of the wilderness have turned green,  
> For the tree has produced its fruit,  
> The fig tree and the vine have yielded in full.

## Joel 2:23

> So shout for joy, you sons of Zion,  
> And rejoice in the Lord your God;  
> For He has given you the early rain for your vindication,  
> And He has brought down for you the rain,  
> The early and latter rain as before.

## Joel 2:24

> The threshing floors will be full of grain,  
> And the vats will overflow with new wine and oil.

## Joel 2:25

> “Then I will compensate you for the years  
> That the swarming locust has eaten,  
> The creeping locust, the stripping locust, and the gnawing locust—  
> My great army which I sent among you.

## Joel 2:26

> You will have plenty to eat and be satisfied,  
> And you will praise the name of the Lord your God,  
> Who has dealt wondrously with you;  
> Then My people will never be put to shame.

## Joel 2:27

> So you will know that I am in the midst of Israel,  
> And that I am the Lord your God  
> And there is no other.  
> And My people will never be put to shame.

## Joel 2:28

> “It will come about after this  
> That I will pour out My Spirit on all mankind;  
> And your sons and daughters will prophesy,  
> Your old men will have dreams,  
> Your young men will see visions.

## Joel 2:29

> And even on the male and female servants  
> I will pour out My Spirit in those days.

## Joel 2:30

> I will display wonders in the sky and on the earth,  
> Blood, fire, and columns of smoke.

## Joel 2:31

> The sun will be turned into darkness,  
> And the moon into blood,  
> Before the great and awesome day of the Lord comes.

## Joel 2:32

> And it will come about that everyone who calls  
> On the name of the Lord will be saved;  
> For on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem  
> There will be those who escape,  
> Just as the Lord has said,  
> Even among the survivors whom the Lord calls.
