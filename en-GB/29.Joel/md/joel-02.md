# Joel Chapter 2

## Joel 2:1

> Sound the trumpet in Zion;
> raise the alarm on my holy mountain.
> Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble,
> for the day of the Lord is coming;
> indeed, it is near—

## Joel 2:2

> a day of darkness and gloom,
> a day of clouds and thick darkness.
> As dawn spreads over the mountains,
> a great and mighty people arises;
> there has never been anything like it,
> nor will there be again for many generations.

## Joel 2:3

> Before them fire consumes,
> and behind them a flame devours.
> The land before them is like the Garden of Eden,
> but behind them a desolate wilderness
> —nothing escapes them.

## Joel 2:4

> Their appearance is like that of horses;
> they gallop like war horses.

## Joel 2:5

> With a noise like chariots,
> they leap over the mountaintops,
> like the crackling of a flame consuming stubble,
> like a mighty army drawn up for battle.

## Joel 2:6

> At their presence, nations are in anguish;
> every face turns pale.

## Joel 2:7

> They charge like warriors,
> they scale walls like soldiers.
> Each marches in line,
> not swerving from their path.

## Joel 2:8

> They do not jostle each other;
> each proceeds straight ahead.
> They burst through defences
> without breaking ranks.

## Joel 2:9

> They storm the city,
> they run along the wall;
> they climb into the houses,
> entering through the windows like thieves.

## Joel 2:10

> Before them the earth shakes,
> the heavens tremble,
> the sun and moon are darkened,
> and the stars lose their brightness.

## Joel 2:11

> The Lord thunders at the head of his army;
> his camp is exceedingly great,
> for mighty is the one who executes his word.
> The day of the Lord is great and very awesome;
> who can endure it?

## Joel 2:12

> “Yet even now,” declares the Lord,
> “return to me with all your heart,
> with fasting, weeping, and mourning.”

## Joel 2:13

> Tear your heart and not your garments.
> Return to the Lord your God,
> for he is gracious and compassionate,
> slow to anger and abounding in love,
> and he relents from sending calamity.

## Joel 2:14

> Who knows? He may turn and relent
> and leave a blessing behind
> —a grain offering and a drink offering
> for the Lord your God.

## Joel 2:15

> Sound the trumpet in Zion,
> consecrate a fast,
> call a sacred assembly.

## Joel 2:16

> Gather the people,
> sanctify the congregation;
> assemble the elders,
> gather the children and those nursing at the breast.
> Let the bridegroom leave his room
> and the bride her chamber.

## Joel 2:17

> Let the priests, who minister before the Lord,
> weep between the porch and the altar.
> Let them say,
> “Spare your people, Lord.
> Do not make your inheritance a disgrace,
> a byword among the nations.
> Why should they say among the peoples,
> ‘Where is their God?’”

## Joel 2:18

Then the Lord was zealous for his land and had compassion on his people.

## Joel 2:19

The Lord replied to his people:

> “I am sending you grain, new wine, and oil,
> enough to satisfy you fully;
> never again will I make you a disgrace among the nations.

## Joel 2:20

> “I will drive the northern army far from you,
> pushing it into a dry and desolate land;
> its advance guard into the eastern sea
> and its rear guard into the western sea.
> Its stench will go up, its smell will rise.”
> Surely he has done great things!

## Joel 2:21

> Do not fear, land of Judah;
> be glad and rejoice,
> for the Lord has done great things!

## Joel 2:22

> Do not fear, you animals of the field,
> for the pastures of the wilderness are becoming green.
> The trees bear their fruit;
> the fig tree and the vine yield their riches.

## Joel 2:23

> Be glad, people of Zion,
> rejoice in the Lord your God,
> for he has given you the early rains in his faithfulness.
> He sends you abundant showers,
> both the early and latter rains as before.

## Joel 2:24

> The threshing floors will be filled with grain;
> the vats will overflow with new wine and oil.

## Joel 2:25

> “I will repay you for the years
> the locusts have eaten—the great locust,
> the young locust, the other locusts, and the locust swarm
> —my great army that I sent among you.

## Joel 2:26

> You will have plenty to eat, until you are full,
> and you will praise the name of the Lord your God,
> who has worked wonders for you;
> never again will my people be put to shame.

## Joel 2:27

> Then you will know that I am in the midst of Israel,
> that I am the Lord your God,
> and there is no other;
> never again will my people be put to shame.

## Joel 2:28

> “And afterward,
> I will pour out my Spirit on all people.
> Your sons and daughters will prophesy,
> your old men will dream dreams,
> your young men will see visions.

## Joel 2:29

> Even on my servants, both men and women,
> I will pour out my Spirit in those days.

## Joel 2:30

> I will show wonders in the heavens and on the earth,
> blood and fire and columns of smoke.

## Joel 2:31

> The sun will be turned to darkness
> and the moon to blood
> before the coming of the great and awesome day of the Lord.

## Joel 2:32

> And everyone who calls
> on the name of the Lord will be saved;
> for on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem
> there will be deliverance,
> as the Lord has said,
> even among the survivors whom the Lord calls.
