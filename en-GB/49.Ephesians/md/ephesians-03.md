# Ephesians Chapter 3

## Ephesians 3:1

Because of this, I, Paul, who am held captive for Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles—

## Ephesians 3:2

Surely you have heard of the stewardship of God’s grace that was given to me for you;

## Ephesians 3:3

that by revelation the mystery was made known to me, as I have written briefly before.

## Ephesians 3:4

In reading this, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,

## Ephesians 3:5

which was not made known to people in past generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to His holy apostles and prophets.

## Ephesians 3:6

This mystery is that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.

## Ephesians 3:7

I became a minister of this gospel by the gift of God’s grace given to me through the working of His power.

## Ephesians 3:8

To me, who am less than the least of all the saints, this grace was given: to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,

## Ephesians 3:9

and to make plain to everyone the administration of this mystery, which for ages past was hidden in God, who created all things.

## Ephesians 3:10

His purpose was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God would be revealed to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms,

## Ephesians 3:11

in accordance with the eternal purpose that He accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.

## Ephesians 3:12

In Him and through faith in Him we may approach God with boldness and confidence.

## Ephesians 3:13

Therefore I ask you not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you, which are your glory.

## Ephesians 3:14

Because of this, I kneel before the Father,

## Ephesians 3:15

from whom every family in heaven and on earth gets their name,

## Ephesians 3:16

I pray that from His glorious riches He may empower you with strength through His Spirit in your inner being,

## Ephesians 3:17

so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; and I pray that you, being rooted and grounded in love,

## Ephesians 3:18

may have power, together with all the saints, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ,

## Ephesians 3:19

and to know this love that surpasses knowledge—that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.

## Ephesians 3:20

Now to Him who is able to accomplish far more than all we ask or imagine, according to His power that is at work within us,

## Ephesians 3:21

to Him be honour in the church and in Christ Jesus across all generations, for ever and ever. Amen.
