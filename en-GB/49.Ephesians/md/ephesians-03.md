# Ephesians Chapter 3

## Ephesians 3:1

For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles—

## Ephesians 3:2

If indeed you have heard of the administration of God’s grace which was given to me for you,

## Ephesians 3:3

That by revelation there was made known to me the mystery, as I wrote earlier in brief.

## Ephesians 3:4

By referring to this, when you read you can understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,

## Ephesians 3:5

Which in other generations was not made known to mankind, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit:

## Ephesians 3:6

That the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel,

## Ephesians 3:7

Of which I was made a minister, according to the gift of God’s grace which was given to me according to the working of His power.

## Ephesians 3:8

To me, the very least of all saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ,

## Ephesians 3:9

And to enlighten all people as to what the plan of the mystery is which for ages has been hidden in God, who created all things;

## Ephesians 3:10

So that the multifaceted wisdom of God might now be made known through the church to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly places.

## Ephesians 3:11

This was in accordance with the eternal purpose which He carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord,

## Ephesians 3:12

In whom we have boldness and confident access through faith in Him.

## Ephesians 3:13

Therefore I ask you not to become discouraged about my tribulations in your behalf, since they are your glory.

## Ephesians 3:14

For this reason I bend my knees before the Father,

## Ephesians 3:15

From whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name,

## Ephesians 3:16

That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inner self,

## Ephesians 3:17

So that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; and that you, being rooted and grounded in love,

## Ephesians 3:18

May be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the width and length and height and depth,

## Ephesians 3:19

And to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled to all the fullness of God.

## Ephesians 3:20

Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all that we ask or think, according to the power that works within us,

## Ephesians 3:21

To Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever. Amen.
