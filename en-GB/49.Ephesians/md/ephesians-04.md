# Ephesians Chapter 4

## Ephesians 4:1

As a prisoner of the Lord, I urge you to conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the calling you have received,

## Ephesians 4:2

with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love.

## Ephesians 4:3

Make every effort to maintain the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace.

## Ephesians 4:4

There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to a single hope at the time of your calling;

## Ephesians 4:5

one Lord, one faith, one baptism;

## Ephesians 4:6

one God and Father of all, who reigns over all, works through all, and is in all.

## Ephesians 4:7

But to each one of us grace has been given according to the measure of Christ’s gift.

## Ephesians 4:8

Therefore it says:

> “When he ascended on high,
> he led captives in his train
> and gave gifts to people.”

## Ephesians 4:9

(Now this, “he ascended,” what does it mean but that he also descended to the lower, earthly regions?

## Ephesians 4:10

He who descended is the very one who ascended far above all the heavens, so that he might fill all things.)

## Ephesians 4:11

And he gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers,

## Ephesians 4:12

to prepare God's people for service, for the strengthening of the body of Christ,

## Ephesians 4:13

until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature adulthood, to the full measure of the stature of Christ.

## Ephesians 4:14

Then we will no longer be children, tossed to and fro by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful scheming.

## Ephesians 4:15

Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into him who is the head, that is, Christ.

## Ephesians 4:16

From him the entire body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part fulfills its role.

## Ephesians 4:17

So I say this, and affirm in the Lord, that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking.

## Ephesians 4:18

They are darkened in their understanding and alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, due to the hardness of their hearts.

## Ephesians 4:19

Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality, to indulge in every kind of impurity with greediness.

## Ephesians 4:20

But this is not the way you came to know Christ,

## Ephesians 4:21

if indeed you heard him and were taught in him, as the truth is in Jesus.

## Ephesians 4:22

You were instructed, concerning your former way of life, to discard your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires;

## Ephesians 4:23

to be renewed in the attitude of your minds;

## Ephesians 4:24

and to embrace the new self, fashioned to reflect God's true righteousness and holiness.

## Ephesians 4:25

Therefore, putting away falsehood, let each of you speak truthfully with his neighbour, for we are all members of one another.

## Ephesians 4:26

“In your anger, do not sin”: Do not let the sun set while you are still angry,

## Ephesians 4:27

and do not allow the devil a foothold.

## Ephesians 4:28

Anyone who has been stealing must steal no longer, but must labour, doing something useful with their own hands, so that they may have something to share with those in need.

## Ephesians 4:29

Let no unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.

## Ephesians 4:30

And do not cause sorrow to the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.

## Ephesians 4:31

Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, clamour, and slander be put away from you, along with all malice.

## Ephesians 4:32

Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ forgave you.
