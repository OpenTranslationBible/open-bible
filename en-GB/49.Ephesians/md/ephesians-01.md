# Ephesians Chapter 1

## Ephesians 1:1

Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, To the saints in Ephesus, who are faithful in Christ Jesus:

## Ephesians 1:2

Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ.

## Ephesians 1:3

Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms in Christ,

## Ephesians 1:4

just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless in His sight. In love

## Ephesians 1:5

He predestined us for adoption to sonship through Jesus Christ, according to the pleasure of His will,

## Ephesians 1:6

to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He has freely given us in the Beloved.

## Ephesians 1:7

Through Him, we have redemption by His sacrifice, the forgiveness of sins, in line with the riches of His grace

## Ephesians 1:8

which He lavished on us. With all wisdom and insight,

## Ephesians 1:9

He revealed to us the mystery of His will, as it pleased Him, which He intended in Christ,

## Ephesians 1:10

to be put into effect when the times reach their fulfilment—to bring unity to all things in heaven and on earth under Christ.

## Ephesians 1:11

In Him we have also obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of Him who works all things in accordance with the plan of His will,

## Ephesians 1:12

so that we, who were the first to place our hope in Christ, might be to the praise of His glory.

## Ephesians 1:13

In Him, you also, when you heard the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and believed, you were sealed in Him with the promised Holy Spirit,

## Ephesians 1:14

who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God’s possession, to the praise of His glory.

## Ephesians 1:15

For this reason, ever since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints,

## Ephesians 1:16

I have not ceased giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers.

## Ephesians 1:17

I keep asking that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and revelation, so that you may know Him better.

## Ephesians 1:18

I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you may know the hope to which He has called you, the riches of His glorious inheritance in His holy people,

## Ephesians 1:19

and His exceedingly great power for us who believe. That power is the same as the mighty strength

## Ephesians 1:20

He exerted when He raised Christ from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places,

## Ephesians 1:21

far above all rule and authority, power and dominion, and every name that is invoked, not only in this age but also in the one to come.

## Ephesians 1:22

And He placed all things under His feet and appointed Him to be head over everything for the church,

## Ephesians 1:23

which is His body, the completeness of Him who fills all in every way.
