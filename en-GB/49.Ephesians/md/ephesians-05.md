# Ephesians Chapter 5

## Ephesians 5:1

Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children;

## Ephesians 5:2

And walk in love, just as Christ also loved us and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma.

## Ephesians 5:3

But sexual immorality, or any impurity or greed, must not even be mentioned among you, as is proper among saints;

## Ephesians 5:4

And there must be no filthiness, or foolish talk, or vulgar joking, which are not fitting, but rather giving of thanks.

## Ephesians 5:5

For this you know with certainty, that no sexually immoral or impure or greedy person, which means an idolater, has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.

## Ephesians 5:6

See that no one deceives you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.

## Ephesians 5:7

Therefore do not become partners with them;

## Ephesians 5:8

For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord; walk as children of light

## Ephesians 5:9

(For the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness, and truth),

## Ephesians 5:10

As you try to learn what is pleasing to the Lord.

## Ephesians 5:11

Do not participate in the useless deeds of darkness, but instead even expose them;

## Ephesians 5:12

For it is disgraceful even to speak of the things which are done by them in secret.

## Ephesians 5:13

But all things become visible when they are exposed by the light, for everything that becomes visible is light.

## Ephesians 5:14

For this reason it says,

> “Wake up, you who are sleeping,  
> And arise from the dead,  
> for the light of Christ will shine on you.”

## Ephesians 5:15

So then, be careful how you walk, not as unwise people but as wise,

## Ephesians 5:16

Making the most of your time, because the days are evil.

## Ephesians 5:17

Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.

## Ephesians 5:18

And do not get drunk with wine, in which there is debauchery, but be filled with the Spirit,

## Ephesians 5:19

Speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your hearts to the Lord;

## Ephesians 5:20

Always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to our God and Father;

## Ephesians 5:21

And subject yourselves to one another in the fear of Christ.

## Ephesians 5:22

Wives, subject yourselves to your own husbands, as to the Lord.

## Ephesians 5:23

For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, He Himself being the Saviour of the body.

## Ephesians 5:24

But as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives ought to be to their husbands in everything.

## Ephesians 5:25

Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her,

## Ephesians 5:26

So that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word,

## Ephesians 5:27

That He might present to Himself the church in all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that she would be holy and blameless.

## Ephesians 5:28

So husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself;

## Ephesians 5:29

For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the church,

## Ephesians 5:30

Because we are parts of His body.

## Ephesians 5:31

For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.

## Ephesians 5:32

This mystery is great; but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church.

## Ephesians 5:33

Nevertheless, as for you individually, each husband is to love his own wife the same as himself, and the wife must see to it that she respects her husband.
