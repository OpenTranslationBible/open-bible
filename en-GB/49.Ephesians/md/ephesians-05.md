# Ephesians Chapter 5

## Ephesians 5:1

Be imitators of God, therefore, as dearly loved children;

## Ephesians 5:2

and walk in the way of love, just as Christ loved you and gave Himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.

## Ephesians 5:3

But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or any kind of impurity, or greed, as is proper among God’s holy people;

## Ephesians 5:4

nor should there be any obscenity, foolish talk, or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving.

## Ephesians 5:5

For of this you can be certain: no immoral, impure, or greedy person—such a person is an idolater—has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.

## Ephesians 5:6

Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things the wrath of God comes upon the disobedient.

## Ephesians 5:7

Therefore do not be partners with them;

## Ephesians 5:8

for you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light

## Ephesians 5:9

(for the fruit of the light consists of all goodness, righteousness, and truth),

## Ephesians 5:10

and try to learn what pleases the Lord.

## Ephesians 5:11

Have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness, but rather expose them;

## Ephesians 5:12

for it is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret.

## Ephesians 5:13

But everything exposed by the light becomes visible, for everything that is illuminated becomes a light.

## Ephesians 5:14

This is why it is said:

> “Wake up, you who are sleeping,  
> And arise from the dead,  
> for the light of Christ will shine on you.”

## Ephesians 5:15

Be very careful, then, how you live—not as unwise but as wise,

## Ephesians 5:16

making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil.

## Ephesians 5:17

Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord’s will is.

## Ephesians 5:18

Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery, but be filled with the Spirit,

## Ephesians 5:19

speaking to one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making music from your heart to the Lord,

## Ephesians 5:20

always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

## Ephesians 5:21

Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.

## Ephesians 5:22

Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands, as to the Lord.

## Ephesians 5:23

For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which He is the Saviour.

## Ephesians 5:24

Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.

## Ephesians 5:25

Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her,

## Ephesians 5:26

to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word,

## Ephesians 5:27

and to present her to Himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless.

## Ephesians 5:28

In this same way, husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.

## Ephesians 5:29

After all, no one ever hated their own body, but they feed and care for it, just as Christ does the church—

## Ephesians 5:30

for we are members of His body.

## Ephesians 5:31

“For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.”

## Ephesians 5:32

This is a profound mystery—but I am talking about Christ and the church.

## Ephesians 5:33

However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.
