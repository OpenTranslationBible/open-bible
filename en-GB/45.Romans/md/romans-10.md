# Romans Chapter 10

## Romans 10:1

Brothers and sisters, my heart’s desire and my prayer to God for them is that they may attain salvation.

## Romans 10:2

For I can testify that they have a zeal for God, but it is not according to knowledge.

## Romans 10:3

For being ignorant of the righteousness of God and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to God’s righteousness.

## Romans 10:4

For Christ is the culmination of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes.

## Romans 10:5

Moses writes about the righteousness that is by the law: “The person who does these things will live by them.”

## Romans 10:6

But the righteousness that is by faith speaks thus: “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’” (that is, to bring Christ down)

## Romans 10:7

or “‘Who will descend into the abyss?’” (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).

## Romans 10:8

But what does it say? “The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,” that is, the word of faith we are proclaiming:

## Romans 10:9

If you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.

## Romans 10:10

For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.

## Romans 10:11

For Scripture says, “Whoever believes in him will never be put to shame.”

## Romans 10:12

For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all, richly blessing all who call on him,

## Romans 10:13

for “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”

## Romans 10:14

How then can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one they have not heard about? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them?

## Romans 10:15

And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: “How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!”

## Romans 10:16

But not all heeded the good news. For Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our report?”

## Romans 10:17

So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.

## Romans 10:18

But I ask: Did they not hear? Indeed they did:

> “Their voice has gone out into all the earth,
> and their words to the ends of the world.”

## Romans 10:19

Again I ask: Did Israel not understand? First, Moses says,

> “I will make you envious by those who are not a nation;
> I will make you angry by a nation that lacks understanding.”

## Romans 10:20

And Isaiah boldly says,

> “I was found by those who did not seek me;
> I revealed myself to those who did not ask for me.”

## Romans 10:21

But concerning Israel he says,

> “All day long I have held out my hands
> to a disobedient and obstinate people.”
