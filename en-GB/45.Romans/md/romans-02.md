# Romans Chapter 2

## Romans 2:1

Therefore, you have no excuse, whoever you are, when you pass judgment on others; for at the point where you judge another, you are condemning yourself, because you who judge are doing the same things.

## Romans 2:2

And we know that God's judgment against those who do such things is according to truth.

## Romans 2:3

So when you, a mere human, pass judgment on them and yet do the same things, do you think you will escape God's judgment?

## Romans 2:4

Or do you disregard the riches of His kindness, forbearance, and patience, not realising that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance?

## Romans 2:5

But because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed.

## Romans 2:6

He will repay each person according to their deeds.

## Romans 2:7

To those who by perseverance in doing good seek glory, honour, and immortality, He will give eternal life.

## Romans 2:8

But for those who are self-seeking and reject the truth and follow unrighteousness, there will be wrath and indignation.

## Romans 2:9

There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil: first for the Jew, then for the Greek;

## Romans 2:10

but glory, honour, and peace for everyone who does good: first for the Jew, then for the Greek.

## Romans 2:11

For God shows no partiality.

## Romans 2:12

All who have sinned apart from the Law will also perish apart from the Law, and all who have sinned under the Law will be judged by the Law.

## Romans 2:13

For it is not the hearers of the Law who are righteous in God's sight, but the doers of the Law who will be justified.

## Romans 2:14

Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the Law, do by nature things required by the Law, they are a law unto themselves, even though they do not have the Law.

## Romans 2:15

They show that the requirements of the Law are written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts sometimes accusing them and at other times defending them.

## Romans 2:16

This will take place on the day when God judges people's secrets through Christ Jesus, as my gospel declares.

## Romans 2:17

Now if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the Law and boast in God,

## Romans 2:18

if you know His will and approve of what is superior because you are instructed by the Law,

## Romans 2:19

if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light for those who are in darkness,

## Romans 2:20

an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, because you have in the Law the embodiment of knowledge and truthâ€”

## Romans 2:21

you, then, who teach others, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal?

## Romans 2:22

You who say that people should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?

## Romans 2:23

You who boast in the Law, do you dishonour God by breaking the Law?

## Romans 2:24

As it is written: "God's name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you."

## Romans 2:25

Circumcision has value if you observe the Law, but if you break the Law, you have become as though you had not been circumcised.

## Romans 2:26

So if those who are not circumcised keep the Law's requirements, will they not be regarded as though they were circumcised?

## Romans 2:27

The one who is not circumcised physically and yet obeys the Law will condemn you who, even though you have the written code and circumcision, are a lawbreaker.

## Romans 2:28

A person is not a Jew who is one only outwardly, nor is circumcision merely outward and physical.

## Romans 2:29

No, a person is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is circumcision of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter. Such a person's praise is not from others, but from God.
