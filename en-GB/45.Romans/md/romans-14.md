## Romans Chapter 14

## Romans 14:1

Welcome the one who is weak in faith, but do not engage in disputes over differing opinions.

## Romans 14:2

Some believe they may eat all things, while the one with a weaker faith eats only vegetables.

## Romans 14:3

The one who eats everything should not look down on the one who does not, and the one who refrains from eating should not judge the one who eats, for God has accepted them.

## Romans 14:4

Who are you to judge another's servant? To their own master they stand or fall. And they will stand, for the Lord is able to make them stand.

## Romans 14:5

Some consider one day more sacred than another, while others consider every day alike. Each person should be fully convinced in their own mind.

## Romans 14:6

Whoever regards a day as special does so for the Lord. Whoever eats, eats to the Lord, for they give thanks to God; and whoever abstains, does so for the Lord and gives thanks to God.

## Romans 14:7

For none of us lives solely for ourselves, and none of us dies solely for ourselves.

## Romans 14:8

If we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord. Therefore, in both life and death, we belong to the Lord.

## Romans 14:9

For this purpose, Christ died and returned to life, so that he might be the Lord of both the dead and the living.

## Romans 14:10

Why do you judge your brother or sister? Or why do you look down on them? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God.

## Romans 14:11

As it is written:

> “‘As surely as I live,’ says the Lord,
> ‘every knee will bow before me;
> every tongue will acknowledge God.’”

## Romans 14:12

So then, each of us will give a personal account to God.

## Romans 14:13

Therefore, let us stop judging one another. Instead, decide not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in the way of a brother or sister.

## Romans 14:14

I am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself. But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for that person it is unclean.

## Romans 14:15

If your brother or sister is distressed because of what you eat, you are no longer acting in love. Do not destroy by your eating someone for whom Christ died.

## Romans 14:16

So, ensure that your good actions are not misrepresented as wrong.

## Romans 14:17

For the kingdom of God is not about eating and drinking, but about righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.

## Romans 14:18

For anyone who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and receives human approval.

## Romans 14:19

Let us therefore pursue what leads to peace and mutual edification.

## Romans 14:20

Do not undo the work of God for the sake of food. All food is clean, but it is wrong for a person to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble.

## Romans 14:21

It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything else that will cause your brother or sister to fall.

## Romans 14:22

So whatever you believe about these things, keep between yourself and God. Blessed is the one who does not condemn themselves by what they approve.

## Romans 14:23

But whoever has doubts is condemned if they eat, because their eating is not from faith; and anything that does not come from faith is sin.
