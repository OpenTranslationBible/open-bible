# Romans Chapter 6

## Romans 6:1
What shall we say then? Should we continue in sin so that grace may abound?

## Romans 6:2
Certainly not! We who have died to sin, how can we live in it any longer?

## Romans 6:3
Or do you not know that all of us who were baptised into Christ Jesus were baptised into his death?

## Romans 6:4
We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death, so that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.

## Romans 6:5
For if we have been united with him in the likeness of his death, we shall certainly also be united with him in the likeness of his resurrection.

## Romans 6:6
Knowing this, that our old self was crucified with him, so that the body of sin might be rendered powerless, that we should no longer be slaves to sin.

## Romans 6:7
For anyone who has died has been freed from sin.

## Romans 6:8
If we have shared in Christ's death, we believe that we will also share in his life.

## Romans 6:9
Knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, is never to die again; death no longer has dominion over him.

## Romans 6:10
He died to sin once for all; but now he lives, and he lives to God.

## Romans 6:11
In the same way, consider yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus.

## Romans 6:12
Therefore, do not allow sin to rule in your mortal body, making you obey its desires.

## Romans 6:13
Do not offer any part of yourself to sin as an instrument of unrighteousness, but rather offer yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and offer every part of yourself to him as an instrument of righteousness.

## Romans 6:14
For sin shall not be your master, because you are not under law, but under grace.

## Romans 6:15
What should we conclude? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? Certainly not!

## Romans 6:16
Do you not know that when you offer yourselves to someone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one you obey, whether of sin leading to death, or of obedience leading to righteousness?

## Romans 6:17
But thanks be to God that, though you were slaves to sin, you have become obedient from the heart to the form of teaching to which you were entrusted.

## Romans 6:18
You have been liberated from sin and have become servants of righteousness.

## Romans 6:19
I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. Just as you used to offer the parts of your body as slaves to impurity and to ever-increasing lawlessness, so now offer them as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification.

## Romans 6:20
For when you were slaves to sin, you were free from the control of righteousness.

## Romans 6:21
What benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are now ashamed of? For the end of those things is death.

## Romans 6:22
But now that you have been set free from sin and have become servants of God, the benefit you reap leads to sanctification, and the result is eternal life.

## Romans 6:23
For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
