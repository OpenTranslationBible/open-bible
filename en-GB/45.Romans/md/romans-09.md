# Romans Chapter 9

## Romans 9:1

I speak truthfully in Christ, I am not lying; my conscience bears witness with me in the Holy Spirit,

## Romans 9:2

that I have immense sorrow and unending grief in my heart.

## Romans 9:3

For I could wish that I myself were accursed and separated from Christ for the sake of my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh,

## Romans 9:4

who are Israelites. Theirs is the adoption as sons and daughters, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the Law, the temple service, and the promises.

## Romans 9:5

Theirs are the patriarchs, and from them is traced the human ancestry of the Messiah, who is God over all, blessed forever. Amen.

## Romans 9:6

It is not as though the word of God has failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are truly Israel.

## Romans 9:7

Nor are they all children simply because they are Abraham’s descendants, but “through Isaac shall your descendants be named.”

## Romans 9:8

This means it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are considered descendants.

## Romans 9:9

For this is how the promise was stated: “At the appointed time I will return, and Sarah will have a son.”

## Romans 9:10

And not only this, but also when Rebecca had conceived twins by one man, our father Isaac;

## Romans 9:11

for before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad, in order that God’s purpose according to election might stand,

## Romans 9:12

not by works but by Him who calls, she was told, “The older will serve the younger.”

## Romans 9:13

As it is written: “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”

## Romans 9:14

What are we to conclude? Is there any injustice with God? Absolutely not!

## Romans 9:15

For He says to Moses,

> “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy,
> and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”

## Romans 9:16

So it does not depend on human desire or effort, but on God’s mercy.

## Romans 9:17

For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, “I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might show my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.”

## Romans 9:18

Therefore, He has mercy on whom He wants to have mercy, and He hardens whom He wants to harden.

## Romans 9:19

You will say to me then, “Why does He still find fault? For who can resist His will?”

## Romans 9:20

But who are you, a mere human, to talk back to God? Shall what is formed say to the one who formed it, “Why did you make me like this?”

## Romans 9:21

Does the potter not have the authority to shape from the same lump of clay some pottery for special purposes and some for common use?

## Romans 9:22

What if God, willing to show His wrath and make His power known, bore with great patience the objects of His wrath prepared for destruction?

## Romans 9:23

What if He did this to make known the riches of His glory upon the objects of His mercy, whom He prepared in advance for glory,

## Romans 9:24

including us, whom He also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles?

## Romans 9:25

As He says in Hosea:

> “I will call them ‘my people’ who were not my people,
> and I will call her ‘my loved one’ who was not my loved one,”

## Romans 9:26

> and, “It shall be that in the place where it was said to them,
> ‘You are not my people,’
> there they will be called ‘children of the living God.’”

## Romans 9:27

Isaiah cries out concerning Israel:

> “Though the number of the Israelites be like the sand by the sea,
> only the remnant will be saved.

## Romans 9:28

> For the Lord will carry out His word on the earth,
> thoroughly and quickly.”

## Romans 9:29

And just as Isaiah said previously:

> “Unless the Lord Almighty
> had left us descendants,
> we would have become like Sodom,
> and would have been like Gomorrah.”

## Romans 9:30

What are we to conclude? That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have attained righteousness, a righteousness that is by faith;

## Romans 9:31

but Israel, in pursuit of a law of righteousness, did not reach that law.

## Romans 9:32

Why not? Because they pursued it not by faith, but as though it were by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone,

## Romans 9:33

as it is written:

> “See, I lay in Zion a stone that causes people to stumble
> and a rock that makes them fall,
> and the one who believes in Him will never be put to shame.”
