# Romans Chapter 3

## Romans 3:1

What advantage, then, does the Jew have? Or what is the benefit of circumcision?

## Romans 3:2

Much in every respect! First of all, they have been entrusted with the very words of God.

## Romans 3:3

What if some did not believe? Will their lack of faith nullify God’s faithfulness?

## Romans 3:4

Certainly not! Let God be true, and every person a liar, as it is written:

> “So that you may be justified in your words
> and prevail when you are judged.”

## Romans 3:5

But if our unrighteousness highlights God’s righteousness, what shall we say? That God is unjust in bringing his wrath upon us? (I speak from a human perspective.)

## Romans 3:6

Certainly not! For if that were the case, how could God judge the world?

## Romans 3:7

But if through my falsehood God’s truthfulness increases to his glory, why am I still judged as a sinner?

## Romans 3:8

And why not say—as we are slanderously reported as saying—“Let us do evil that good may come”? Their condemnation is just.

## Romans 3:9

What then? Are we any better off? Not at all! For we have already charged that both Jews and Greeks are all under the power of sin.

## Romans 3:10

As it is written:

> “There is no one righteous, not even one;

## Romans 3:11

> there is no one who understands;
> there is no one who seeks God.

## Romans 3:12

> All have turned away, they have together become worthless;
> there is no one who does good,
> not even one.”

## Romans 3:13

> “Their throats are open graves;
> with their tongues they keep deceiving.”
> “The poison of vipers is on their lips.”

## Romans 3:14

> “Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.”

## Romans 3:15

> “Their feet are swift to shed blood;

## Romans 3:16

> destruction and distress are in their paths,

## Romans 3:17

> and they have not understood nor known the way of peace.”

## Romans 3:18

> “There is no fear of God before their eyes.”

## Romans 3:19

Now we know that whatever the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God.

## Romans 3:20

Therefore no one will be justified in his sight by the works of the law; for through the law comes knowledge of sin.

## Romans 3:21

But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been revealed, being testified to by the Law and the Prophets.

## Romans 3:22

This righteousness is given through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no distinction,

## Romans 3:23

for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,

## Romans 3:24

and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.

## Romans 3:25

God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement, through the shedding of his blood, to be received by faith. He did this to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished—

## Romans 3:26

he did this to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.

## Romans 3:27

What place, then, is there for boasting? It is ruled out. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith.

## Romans 3:28

For we hold that a person is justified by faith, independent of the works of the law.

## Romans 3:29

Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also,

## Romans 3:30

since there is only one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through the same faith.

## Romans 3:31

Do we then nullify the law by this faith? Certainly not! On the contrary, we uphold the law.
