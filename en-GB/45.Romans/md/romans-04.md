# Romans Chapter 4

## Romans 4:1

What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, has discovered in this matter?

## Romans 4:2

If indeed Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God.

## Romans 4:3

What does Scripture declare? “Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness.”

## Romans 4:4

Now to the one who works, wages are not credited as a gift, but as something due.

## Romans 4:5

However, to the one who does not work but believes in Him who justifies the ungodly, their faith is credited as righteousness.

## Romans 4:6

Just as David also speaks of the blessedness of the person to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:

## Romans 4:7

> “Happy are those
> whose wrongdoings are forgiven,
> whose sins are covered.

## Romans 4:8

> Blessed is the one
> whose sin the Lord will not count against them.”

## Romans 4:9

Is this blessedness only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? For we say that faith was credited to Abraham as righteousness.

## Romans 4:10

Under what circumstances was it credited? Was it while he was circumcised, or uncircumcised? It was not while circumcised, but while uncircumcised.

## Romans 4:11

And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised, so that he might be the father of all who believe without being circumcised, that righteousness might be credited to them.

## Romans 4:12

And he is also the father of the circumcised who not only are circumcised but who also follow in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.

## Romans 4:13

It was not through the law that Abraham and his descendants received the promise that he would be heir of the world, but through the righteousness that comes by faith.

## Romans 4:14

For if those who rely on the law are heirs, then faith is made void and the promise is nullified,

## Romans 4:15

because the law results in wrath. And where there is no law, there is no transgression.

## Romans 4:16

Therefore, the promise is based on faith, so that it may rest on grace and be assured to all Abraham’s offspring—not only to those who are of the law but also to those who share the faith of Abraham. He is the father of us all.

## Romans 4:17

As it is written: “I have made you a father of many nations.” He is our father in the sight of God, in whom he believed—the God who gives life to the dead and calls into being things that do not exist.

## Romans 4:18

Against all hope, Abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations, just as it had been said to him, “So shall your descendants be.”

## Romans 4:19

Without weakening in his faith, he considered his own body, now as good as dead since he was about a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarah’s womb.

## Romans 4:20

Yet he did not hesitate through unbelief regarding God’s promise, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God,

## Romans 4:21

being fully persuaded that God had the power to do what He had promised.

## Romans 4:22

This is the reason “it was credited to him as righteousness.”

## Romans 4:23

The words “it was credited to him” were written not for his sake alone,

## Romans 4:24

but also for us, to whom it will be credited—for us who believe in Him who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead.

## Romans 4:25

He was handed over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification.
