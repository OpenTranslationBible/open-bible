# Romans Chapter 13

## Romans 13:1
Every person should be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which is from God, and those that exist have been established by God.

## Romans 13:2
Therefore, whoever resists the authority is opposing what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment upon themselves.

## Romans 13:3
For rulers are not a cause of fear for those who do good, but for those who do evil. Do you wish to be free from fear of the authority? Do what is right and you will receive commendation.

## Romans 13:4
For the authority is a servant of God for your benefit. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for it does not bear the sword in vain; it is a servant of God, an avenger to bring wrath upon the evildoer.

## Romans 13:5
Therefore, it is necessary to submit to the authorities, not only to avoid wrath but also for the sake of conscience.

## Romans 13:6
This is why you also pay taxes, for the authorities are servants of God, devoting themselves to this task.

## Romans 13:7
Render to all what is due them: taxes to whom taxes are due; revenue to whom revenue is due; respect to whom respect is due; honour to whom honour is due.

## Romans 13:8
Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another; for the one who loves others has fulfilled the law.

## Romans 13:9
The commandments, “You shall not commit adultery,” “You shall not murder,” “You shall not steal,” “You shall not covet,” and any other commandment, are summed up in this saying: “Love your neighbour as yourself.”

## Romans 13:10
Love brings no harm to a neighbour; thus, love is the fulfilment of the law.

## Romans 13:11
And do this, understanding the present time: the hour has come for you to wake up from your sleep, for our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed.

## Romans 13:12
The night is almost over, and the day is near. So let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armour of light.

## Romans 13:13
Let us behave decently, as in the daytime, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and debauchery, not in strife and jealousy.

## Romans 13:14
Instead, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the flesh.
