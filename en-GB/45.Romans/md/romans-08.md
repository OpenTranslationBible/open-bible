# Romans Chapter 8

## Romans 8:1

Therefore, there is now no condemnation whatsoever for those who are in Christ Jesus.

## Romans 8:2

For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has liberated you from the law of sin and death.

## Romans 8:3

For what the law was powerless to accomplish, weakened as it was by the flesh, God achieved by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh to be a sin offering, thus condemning sin in the flesh,

## Romans 8:4

so that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not live according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.

## Romans 8:5

Those who live according to the flesh have their minds set on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit have their minds set on the things of the Spirit.

## Romans 8:6

For the mind governed by the flesh is death, but the mind governed by the Spirit is life and peace.

## Romans 8:7

Because the mind set on the flesh is hostile to God; it does not submit to God's law, nor can it do so.

## Romans 8:8

Those who live by the flesh cannot please God.

## Romans 8:9

However, you are not in the realm of the flesh but in the realm of the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, they do not belong to Him.

## Romans 8:10

But if Christ is in you, although the body is subject to death because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness.

## Romans 8:11

And if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you.

## Romans 8:12

Therefore, brothers and sisters, we have an obligation, but it is not to the flesh, to live according to it—

## Romans 8:13

for if you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.

## Romans 8:14

For all who are led by the Spirit of God are the children of God.

## Romans 8:15

For you did not receive a spirit of slavery leading to fear again, but you received a spirit of adoption as sons and daughters by which we cry out, “Abba, Father.”

## Romans 8:16

The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children.

## Romans 8:17

And if we are children, then we are heirs—heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in His sufferings in order that we may also share in His glory.

## Romans 8:18

I consider that our current sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us.

## Romans 8:19

For the creation eagerly awaits the revealing of the children of God.

## Romans 8:20

For the creation was subjected to futility, not by its own choice, but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope

## Romans 8:21

that the creation itself will be freed from its bondage to decay and brought into the freedom and glory of the children of God.

## Romans 8:22

We know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time.

## Romans 8:23

Not only so, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons and daughters, the redemption of our bodies.

## Romans 8:24

For in this hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is not hope at all. Who hopes for what they already see?

## Romans 8:25

But if we hope for what we do not yet see, we wait for it with perseverance.

## Romans 8:26

In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words.

## Romans 8:27

And He who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for God's people in accordance with God's will.

## Romans 8:28

And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love Him, who have been called according to His purpose.

## Romans 8:29

For those God foreknew He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, so that He might be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters.

## Romans 8:30

And those He predestined, He also called; those He called, He also justified; those He justified, He also glorified.

## Romans 8:31

What then shall we say in response to these matters? If God is for us, who can be against us?

## Romans 8:32

He who did not spare His own Son, but gave Him up for us all—how will He not also, along with Him, graciously give us all things?

## Romans 8:33

Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God who justifies.

## Romans 8:34

Who then is the one who condemns? No one. Christ Jesus who died—more than that, who was raised to life—is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us.

## Romans 8:35

Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or trouble, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?

## Romans 8:36

As it is written:

> “For your sake we face death all day long;
> we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.”

## Romans 8:37

No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us.

## Romans 8:38

For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor principalities, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers,

## Romans 8:39

neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
