# Romans Chapter 1

## Romans 1:1

Paul, a devoted follower of Christ Jesus, appointed as an apostle, designated for the gospel of God—

## Romans 1:2

which he had promised long ago through his prophets in the holy Scriptures,

## Romans 1:3

concerning his Son, who was a descendant of David according to the flesh,

## Romans 1:4

and who was declared to be the Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord.

## Romans 1:5

Through him we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles for his name’s sake.

## Romans 1:6

And you also are among those who are called to belong to Jesus Christ.

## Romans 1:7

To all who are loved by God in Rome, called to be saints: Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

## Romans 1:8

First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is being proclaimed throughout the world.

## Romans 1:9

For God, whom I serve in my spirit in the preaching of the gospel of his Son, is my witness as to how unceasingly I remember you

## Romans 1:10

always in my prayers, asking that now at last by God’s will I may succeed in coming to you.

## Romans 1:11

I am eager to see you so that I may share with you some spiritual gift to strengthen you—

## Romans 1:12

so that we may encourage one another by our faith, yours and mine.

## Romans 1:13

I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that I have often planned to come to you (but have been prevented until now) so that I may have a harvest among you, just as I have had among the other Gentiles.

## Romans 1:14

I have a duty to both Greeks and non-Greeks, both to the wise and the foolish.

## Romans 1:15

That is why I am eager to preach the gospel also to you who are in Rome.

---

## Romans 1:16

For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile.

## Romans 1:17

For in it the righteousness of God is revealed—a righteousness that is by faith from start to finish, as it is written: “The righteous will live by faith.”

---

## Romans 1:18

For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and wickedness of people, who suppress the truth by their wickedness,

## Romans 1:19

because what is known about God is plain to them, for God has made it plain to them.

## Romans 1:20

For since the creation of the world, God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly perceived, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.

## Romans 1:21

For although they knew God, they neither honoured him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened.

## Romans 1:22

Though they claimed wisdom, they became foolish

## Romans 1:23

and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles.

---

## Romans 1:24

Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to impurity, to dishonour their bodies with one another.

## Romans 1:25

They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshipped and served created things rather than the Creator—who is blessed forever. Amen.

---

## Romans 1:26

For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones.

## Romans 1:27

In the same way, the men abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.

---

## Romans 1:28

Furthermore, just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done.

## Romans 1:29

They have become filled with all manner of wickedness, evil, greed, and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, and malice. They are gossips,

## Romans 1:30

slanderers, those who despise God, insolent, arrogant, and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents;

## Romans 1:31

they lack understanding, fidelity, love, and mercy.

## Romans 1:32

Although they are aware of God’s righteous decree that those who engage in such actions deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.
