# Romans Chapter 11

## Romans 11:1

I say then, God has not rejected His people, has He? Far from it! For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.

## Romans 11:2

God has not rejected His people whom He foreknew. Or do you not know what the Scripture says in the passage about Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel?

## Romans 11:3

“Lord, they have killed Your prophets, they have torn down Your altars, and I alone am left, and they are seeking my life.”

## Romans 11:4

But what is the divine response to him? “I have kept for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.”

## Romans 11:5

In the same way then, there has also come to be at the present time a remnant according to God’s gracious choice.

## Romans 11:6

But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works, since otherwise grace is no longer grace.

## Romans 11:7

What then? What Israel is seeking, it has not obtained, but those who were chosen obtained it, and the rest were hardened;

## Romans 11:8

Just as it is written:

> “God gave them a spirit of stupor,  
> Eyes to see not and ears to hear not,  
> Down to this very day.”

## Romans 11:9

And David says,

> “May their table become a snare and a trap,  
> And a stumbling block and a retribution to them.

## Romans 11:10

> May their eyes be darkened to see not,  
> And bend their backs continually.”

## Romans 11:11

I say then, they did not stumble so as to fall, did they? Far from it! But by their wrongdoing salvation has come to the Gentiles, to make them jealous.

## Romans 11:12

Now if their wrongdoing proves to be riches for the world, and their failure riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fullness be!

## Romans 11:13

But I am speaking to you who are Gentiles. Therefore insofar as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I magnify my ministry,

## Romans 11:14

If somehow I may move my own people to jealousy and save some of them.

## Romans 11:15

For if their rejection proves to be the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?

## Romans 11:16

If the first piece of dough is holy, the lump also; and if the root is holy, the branches are as well.

## Romans 11:17

But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them and became partaker with them of the rich root of the olive tree,

## Romans 11:18

Do not be arrogant toward the branches; but if you are arrogant, remember that it is not you who supports the root, but the root supports you.

## Romans 11:19

You will say then, “Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.”

## Romans 11:20

Quite right, they were broken off for their unbelief, but you stand by your faith. Do not be conceited, but fear;

## Romans 11:21

For if God did not spare the natural branches, He will not spare you, either.

## Romans 11:22

See then the kindness and severity of God: to those who fell, severity; but to you, God’s kindness, if you continue in His kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off.

## Romans 11:23

And they also, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.

## Romans 11:24

For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, who are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?

## Romans 11:25

For I do not want you, brothers and sisters, to be uninformed of this mystery—so that you will not be wise in your own estimation—that a partial hardening has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in;

## Romans 11:26

And so all Israel will be saved; just as it is written:

> “The Deliverer will come from Zion,  
> He will remove ungodliness from Jacob.”

## Romans 11:27

> “This is My covenant with them,  
> When I take away their sins.”

## Romans 11:28

In relation to the gospel they are enemies for your sake, but in relation to God’s choice they are beloved for the sake of the fathers;

## Romans 11:29

For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.

## Romans 11:30

For just as you once were disobedient to God, but now have been shown mercy because of their disobedience,

## Romans 11:31

So these also now have been disobedient, so that because of the mercy shown to you they also may now be shown mercy.

## Romans 11:32

For God has shut up all in disobedience, so that He may show mercy to all.

## Romans 11:33

> Oh, the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!
> How unsearchable are His judgements
> and unfathomable His ways!

## Romans 11:34

> For who has known the mind of the Lord,
> or who became His counsellor?

## Romans 11:35

> Or who has first given to Him,
> that it would be paid back to him?

## Romans 11:36

> For from Him, and through Him, and to Him are all things.
> To Him be the glory forever. Amen.
