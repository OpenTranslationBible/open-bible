# Romans Chapter 11

## Romans 11:1

I ask, then, has God cast away His people? Certainly not! For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.

## Romans 11:2

God has not rejected His people whom He foreknew. Do you not know what the Scripture says in the story about Elijah, how he pleaded with God against Israel?

## Romans 11:3

“Lord, they have killed Your prophets and demolished Your altars; I alone am left, and they are seeking my life.”

## Romans 11:4

But what was the divine response to him? “I have reserved for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.”

## Romans 11:5

So too, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace.

## Romans 11:6

And if by grace, then it is no longer based on works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace.

## Romans 11:7

What then? What Israel sought so earnestly it did not obtain, but the elect did. The others were hardened,

## Romans 11:8

as it is written:

> “God gave them a spirit of stupor,
> eyes that do not see and ears that do not hear,
> down to this very day.”

## Romans 11:9

And David says,

> “May their table become a snare and a trap,
> a stumbling block and a retribution for them.

## Romans 11:10

> May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see,
> and their backs be bent forever.”

## Romans 11:11

I ask then, did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Certainly not! But because of their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel envious.

## Romans 11:12

Now if their transgression means riches for the world, and their loss means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their full inclusion bring!

## Romans 11:13

I am speaking to you Gentiles. Insofar as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry

## Romans 11:14

if somehow I might provoke my own people to jealousy and save some of them.

## Romans 11:15

For if their rejection led to the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?

## Romans 11:16

If the first piece of dough is holy, the whole batch is holy; if the root is holy, so are the branches.

## Romans 11:17

If some of the branches were broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among them and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root,

## Romans 11:18

do not boast over those branches. If you do, remember that it is not you who support the root, but the root supports you.

## Romans 11:19

You might say, “Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in.”

## Romans 11:20

True enough. They were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid.

## Romans 11:21

Because if God did not spare even the natural branches, He will not spare you either.

## Romans 11:22

Consider therefore the kindness and severity of God: severity to those who fell, but kindness to you, provided you continue in His kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off.

## Romans 11:23

And if they do not continue in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.

## Romans 11:24

For if you were cut from an olive tree that is wild by nature, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree!

## Romans 11:25

I do not want you to be unaware of this mystery, brothers and sisters, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a partial hardening until the full number of the Gentiles has come in,

## Romans 11:26

and in this way all Israel will be saved. As it is written:

> “The Deliverer will come from Zion;
> He will turn ungodliness away from Jacob.

## Romans 11:27

> And this is My covenant with them
> when I take away their sins.”

## Romans 11:28

As far as the gospel is concerned, they are adversaries for your benefit; but as far as election is concerned, they are loved on account of the patriarchs,

## Romans 11:29

for God’s gifts and His call are unchangeable.

## Romans 11:30

Just as you who were once disobedient to God have now received mercy as a result of their disobedience,

## Romans 11:31

so they too have now become disobedient so that they too may now receive mercy as a result of God’s mercy to you.

## Romans 11:32

For God has allowed everyone to be disobedient so that He may have mercy on them all.

## Romans 11:33

> Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God!
> How unsearchable His judgments,
> and His paths beyond tracing out!

## Romans 11:34

> “Who has known the mind of the Lord?
> Or who has been His counsellor?”

## Romans 11:35

> “Who has ever given to God,
> that God should repay them?”

## Romans 11:36

> For from Him and through Him and for Him are all things.
> To Him be the glory forever! Amen.
