# Romans Chapter 12

## Romans 12:1

Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, by the mercies of God, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God—this is your true and spiritual act of worship.

## Romans 12:2

Do not be conformed to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. This way, you will be able to discern what God’s will is—his good, acceptable, and perfect will.

## Romans 12:3

For by the grace given to me, I say to every one of you: Do not think of yourself more highly than you should, but rather think with sober judgment, in accordance with the measure of faith God has distributed to each of you.

## Romans 12:4

Just as we have many parts in one body, and these parts do not all have the same function,

## Romans 12:5

in the same way, we are united in Christ as one body, and each member is connected to all the others.

## Romans 12:6

We have different gifts, according to the grace given to each of us. If your gift is prophecy, then prophesy in accordance with your faith;

## Romans 12:7

if it is service, then serve; if it is teaching, then teach;

## Romans 12:8

if it is to encourage, then give encouragement; if it is giving, give generously; if it is to lead, do so with diligence; if it is to show mercy, do it with cheerfulness.

## Romans 12:9

Love must be sincere and free of hypocrisy. Detest what is evil; cling to what is good.

## Romans 12:10

Be devoted to one another in brotherly love. Honour one another above yourselves.

## Romans 12:11

Do not be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervour, serving the Lord.

## Romans 12:12

Rejoice in hope, be patient in affliction, and faithful in prayer.

## Romans 12:13

Contribute to the needs of the saints and practise hospitality.

## Romans 12:14

Bless those who persecute you; bless them and do not curse.

## Romans 12:15

Share in the joy of those who rejoice; share in the sorrow of those who are sorrowful.

## Romans 12:16

Live in harmony with one another. Do not be proud, but be willing to associate with people of low position. Do not be wise in your own estimation.

## Romans 12:17

Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the sight of everyone.

## Romans 12:18

As much as it is within your power, strive to live at peace with everyone.

## Romans 12:19

Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God’s wrath, for it is written: “Vengeance is mine; I will repay,” says the Lord.

## Romans 12:20

Instead,

> if your enemy is hungry, provide him with food;
> if he is thirsty, offer him something to drink.
> By doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head.

## Romans 12:21

Do not let evil defeat you, but instead overcome evil by doing good.
