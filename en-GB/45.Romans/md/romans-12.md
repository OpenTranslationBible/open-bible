# Romans Chapter 12

## Romans 12:1

Therefore I urge you, brothers and sisters, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship.

## Romans 12:2

And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.

## Romans 12:3

For through the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think, but to think so as to have sound judgement, as God has allotted to each a measure of faith.

## Romans 12:4

For just as we have many parts in one body and all the body’s parts do not have the same function,

## Romans 12:5

So we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually parts of one another.

## Romans 12:6

However, since we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, each of us is to use them properly: if prophecy, in proportion to one’s faith;

## Romans 12:7

If service, in the act of serving; or the one who teaches, in the act of teaching;

## Romans 12:8

Or the one who exhorts, in the work of exhortation; the one who gives, with generosity; the one who leads, with diligence; the one who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.

## Romans 12:9

Love must be free of hypocrisy. Detest what is evil; cling to what is good.

## Romans 12:10

Be devoted to one another in brotherly love; give preference to one another in honour,

## Romans 12:11

Not lagging behind in diligence, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord;

## Romans 12:12

Rejoicing in hope, persevering in tribulation, devoted to prayer,

## Romans 12:13

Contributing to the needs of the saints, practicing hospitality.

## Romans 12:14

Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse.

## Romans 12:15

Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep.

## Romans 12:16

Be of the same mind toward one another; do not be haughty in mind, but associate with the lowly. Do not be wise in your own estimation.

## Romans 12:17

Never repay evil for evil to anyone. Respect what is right in the sight of all people.

## Romans 12:18

If possible, so far as it depends on you, be at peace with all people.

## Romans 12:19

Never take your own revenge, beloved, but leave room for the wrath of God, for it is written:  
“Vengeance is Mine, I will repay,” says the Lord.

## Romans 12:20

> “But if your enemy is hungry, feed him;  
> If he is thirsty, give him a drink;  
> For in so doing you will heap burning coals on his head.”

## Romans 12:21

Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
