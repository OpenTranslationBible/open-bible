# Romans Chapter 7

## Romans 7:1
Do you not know, brothers and sisters (for I am addressing those who are familiar with the law), that the law has authority over a person only as long as they live?

## Romans 7:2
For instance, a married woman is legally bound to her husband while he is alive; but if her husband dies, she is released from the law that binds her to him.

## Romans 7:3
So then, if she is with another man while her husband is still alive, she is called an adulteress; but if her husband dies, she is free from that law, so she is not an adulteress if she is with another man.

## Romans 7:4
Therefore, my brothers and sisters, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you might belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit for God.

## Romans 7:5
For when we were in the realm of the flesh, the sinful passions, which were aroused by the law, were at work in us, so that we bore fruit for death.

## Romans 7:6
But now, having died to what once bound us, we are released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code.

## Romans 7:7
What shall we say then? Is the law sinful? Certainly not! On the contrary, I would not have known what sin was except through the law. For I would not have known what coveting was if the law had not said, “You shall not covet.”

## Romans 7:8
But sin, taking the opportunity afforded by the commandment, produced in me every kind of coveting. For apart from the law, sin is dead.

## Romans 7:9
There was a time when I lived without the law; but when the commandment arrived, sin came alive and I died.

## Romans 7:10
I found that the commandment, which was intended to bring life, actually brought death.

## Romans 7:11
For sin, taking the opportunity afforded by the commandment, deceived me, and through it, put me to death.

## Romans 7:12
Therefore, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous, and good.

## Romans 7:13
Did that which is good, then, become death to me? By no means! Rather, it was sin, in order that it might be recognised as sin by bringing about my death through what is good, so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful.

## Romans 7:14
For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin.

## Romans 7:15
I am confused by my actions. For I do not do what I want to do, but rather what I detest.

## Romans 7:16
And if I act against my own desires, I acknowledge that the law is good.

## Romans 7:17
As it stands, it is no longer I who act, but the sin residing in me.

## Romans 7:18
For I know that good itself does not dwell in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out.

## Romans 7:19
For I fail to do the good I wish to do, but instead, I continue doing the evil I do not wish to do.

## Romans 7:20
Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but the sin residing in me that does it.

## Romans 7:21
So I find this principle at work: Although I want to do good, evil is right there with me.

## Romans 7:22
For deep within, I take joy in God’s law;

## Romans 7:23
but I see another law at work in me, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within my body.

## Romans 7:24
What a troubled person I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death?

## Romans 7:25
Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God’s law, but in my flesh a slave to the law of sin.
