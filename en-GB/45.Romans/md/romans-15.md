# Romans Chapter 15

## Romans 15:1

We who are strong ought to bear with the weaknesses of those without strength and not merely please ourselves.

## Romans 15:2

Each of us should please our neighbour for their good, to build them up.

## Romans 15:3

For even Christ did not seek His own pleasure, but as it is written: “The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me.”

## Romans 15:4

For whatever was written in earlier times was written for our instruction, so that through endurance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.

## Romans 15:5

Now may the God who gives endurance and encouragement grant you to be of the same mind with one another, according to Christ Jesus,

## Romans 15:6

so that with unity of mind and voice you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

## Romans 15:7

Therefore, accept one another, just as Christ accepted you, for the glory of God.

## Romans 15:8

For I say that Christ has become a servant of the Jews on behalf of God’s truth, to confirm the promises made to the patriarchs,

## Romans 15:9

and so that the Gentiles might glorify God for His mercy. As it is written:

> “Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles;
> I will sing praises to your name.”

## Romans 15:10

Again it says,

> “Rejoice, you Gentiles, with His people.”

## Romans 15:11

And again,

> “Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles; let all the peoples extol Him.”

## Romans 15:12

And again, Isaiah says,

> “The Root of Jesse will spring up,
> one who will arise to rule over the nations;
> in Him the Gentiles will hope.”

## Romans 15:13

Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in Him, so that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.

## Romans 15:14

I myself am convinced, my brothers and sisters, that you are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge and able to instruct one another.

## Romans 15:15

But I have written to you quite boldly on some points to remind you again, because of the grace given to me by God,

## Romans 15:16

to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, so that the offering of the Gentiles may become acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.

## Romans 15:17

Therefore, in Christ Jesus I have found reason to take pride in things pertaining to God.

## Romans 15:18

For I will not presume to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me in leading the Gentiles to obey God by word and deed,

## Romans 15:19

through the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Spirit; so from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ.

## Romans 15:20

And in this way I aspired to preach the gospel, not where Christ was already recognised, so that I would not build on another person’s foundation;

## Romans 15:21

but as it is written:

> “Those who were not told about Him will see,
> and those who have not heard will understand.”

## Romans 15:22

This is why I have often been prevented from coming to you;

## Romans 15:23

but now, with no further place for me in these regions, and since I have longed for many years to visit you,

## Romans 15:24

I plan to do so when I go to Spain. I hope to see you while passing through and to be helped on my journey there by you, after I have enjoyed your company for a while.

## Romans 15:25

But now, I am on my way to Jerusalem, serving the saints.

## Romans 15:26

For Macedonia and Achaia were delighted to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.

## Romans 15:27

They were pleased to do so, and indeed they owe it to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in the Jews’ spiritual blessings, they owe it to the Jews to share with them their material blessings.

## Romans 15:28

Therefore, when I have completed this task and have put my seal on this fruit of theirs, I will go to Spain and visit you on the way.

## Romans 15:29

I am confident that when I come to you, I will arrive with the full blessing of Christ.

## Romans 15:30

I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to join me in my struggle by praying to God for me,

## Romans 15:31

that I may be rescued from those who are disobedient in Judea, and that my service for Jerusalem may be favourably received by the saints;

## Romans 15:32

so that I may come to you with joy by the will of God and be refreshed in your company.

## Romans 15:33

May the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
