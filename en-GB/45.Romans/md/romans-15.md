# Romans Chapter 15

## Romans 15:1

Now we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of those without strength, and not just please ourselves.

## Romans 15:2

Each of us is to please his neighbour for his good, to his edification.

## Romans 15:3

For even Christ did not please Himself, but as it is written:  
“The taunts of those who taunt You have fallen on Me.”

## Romans 15:4

For whatever was written in earlier times was written for our instruction, so that through perseverance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.

## Romans 15:5

Now may the God of perseverance and encouragement grant you to be of the same mind with one another, according to Christ Jesus,

## Romans 15:6

So that with one accord you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

## Romans 15:7

Therefore, accept one another, just as Christ also accepted us, for the glory of God.

## Romans 15:8

For I say that Christ has become a servant to the circumcision in behalf of the truth of God, to confirm the promises given to the fathers,

## Romans 15:9

And for the Gentiles to glorify God for His mercy; as it is written:

> “Therefore I will give praise to You among the Gentiles,  
> And I will sing praises to Your name.”

## Romans 15:10

Again it says,

> “Rejoice, you Gentiles, with His people.”

## Romans 15:11

And again,

> “Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles,  
> And let all the peoples praise Him.”

## Romans 15:12

Again Isaiah says,

> “There shall come the root of Jesse,  
> And He who arises to rule over the Gentiles,  
> In Him will the Gentiles hope.”

## Romans 15:13

Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you will abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.

## Romans 15:14

And concerning you, my brothers and sisters, I myself also am convinced that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, and able also to admonish one another.

## Romans 15:15

But I have written very boldly to you on some points, so as to remind you again, because of the grace that was given to me from God,

## Romans 15:16

To be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, so that my offering of the Gentiles may become acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.

## Romans 15:17

Therefore I have reason for boasting in Christ Jesus regarding the things pertaining to God.

## Romans 15:18

For I will not presume to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me, resulting in the obedience of the Gentiles by word and deed,

## Romans 15:19

In the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Spirit; so that from Jerusalem and all around as far as Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.

## Romans 15:20

And in this way I aspired to preach the gospel, not where Christ was already named, so that I would not build on another person’s foundation;

## Romans 15:21

But as it is written:

> “Those who have not been told about Him will see,  
> And those who have not heard will understand.”

## Romans 15:22

For this reason I have often been prevented from coming to you;

## Romans 15:23

But now, with no further place for me in these regions, and since I have had for many years a longing to come to you

## Romans 15:24

Whenever I go to Spain—for I hope to see you in passing, and to be helped on my way there by you, when I have first enjoyed your company for a while—

## Romans 15:25

But now, I am going to Jerusalem, serving the saints.

## Romans 15:26

For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.

## Romans 15:27

Yes, they were pleased to do so, and they are indebted to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual things, they are indebted to serve them also in material things.

## Romans 15:28

Therefore, after I have completed this and have put my seal on this fruit of theirs, I will go on by way of you to Spain.

## Romans 15:29

I know that when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.

## Romans 15:30

Now I urge you, brothers and sisters, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in your prayers to God for me,

## Romans 15:31

That I may be rescued from those who are disobedient in Judea, and that my service for Jerusalem may prove acceptable to the saints;

## Romans 15:32

So that I may come to you in joy by the will of God and relax in your company.

## Romans 15:33

Now may the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
