# Romans Chapter 15

## Romans 15:1

Now we who are strong ought to bear the weaknesses of those without strength, and not just please ourselves.

## Romans 15:2

Each of us is to please his neighbour for his good, to his edification.

## Romans 15:3

For even Christ did not please Himself, but as it is written:  
“The taunts of those who taunt You have fallen on Me.”

## Romans 15:4

For whatever was written in earlier times was written for our instruction, so that through perseverance and the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.

## Romans 15:5

Now may the God of perseverance and encouragement grant you to be of the same mind with one another, according to Christ Jesus,

## Romans 15:6

So that with one accord you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

## Romans 15:7

Therefore, accept one another, just as Christ also accepted us, for the glory of God.

## Romans 15:8

For I say that Christ has become a servant to the circumcision in behalf of the truth of God, to confirm the promises given to the fathers,

## Romans 15:9

And for the Gentiles to glorify God for His mercy; as it is written:

> “Therefore I will give praise to You among the Gentiles,  
> And I will sing praises to Your name.”

## Romans 15:10

Again it says,

> “Rejoice, you Gentiles, with His people.”

## Romans 15:11

And again,

> “Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles,  
> And let all the peoples praise Him.”

## Romans 15:12

Again Isaiah says,

> “There shall come the root of Jesse,  
> And He who arises to rule over the Gentiles,  
> In Him will the Gentiles hope.”

## Romans 15:13

Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you will abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.

## Romans 15:14

And concerning you, my brothers and sisters, I myself also am convinced that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, and able also to admonish one another.

## Romans 15:15

But I have written very boldly to you on some points, so as to remind you again, because of the grace that was given to me from God,

## Romans 15:16

To be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, so that my offering of the Gentiles may become acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.

## Romans 15:17

Therefore I have reason for boasting in Christ Jesus regarding the things pertaining to God.

## Romans 15:18

For I will not presume to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me, resulting in the obedience of the Gentiles by word and deed,

## Romans 15:19

In the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Spirit; so that from Jerusalem and all around as far as Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.

## Romans 15:20

And in this way I aspired to preach the gospel, not where Christ was already named, so that I would not build on another person’s foundation;

## Romans 15:21

But as it is written:

> “Those who have not been told about Him will see,  
> And those who have not heard will understand.”

## Romans 15:22

For this reason I have often been prevented from coming to you;

## Romans 15:23

But now, with no further place for me in these regions, and since I have had for many years a longing to come to you

## Romans 15:24

Whenever I go to Spain—for I hope to see you in passing, and to be helped on my way there by you, when I have first enjoyed your company for a while—

## Romans 15:25

But now, I am going to Jerusalem, serving the sain
