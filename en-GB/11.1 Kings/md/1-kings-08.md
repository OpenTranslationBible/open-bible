# 1 Kings Chapter 8

## 1 Kings 8:1

Then Solomon gathered the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes,  
the leaders of the ancestral houses of the sons of Israel,  
to King Solomon in Jerusalem,  
to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord from the city of David, which is Zion.

## 1 Kings 8:2

All the men of Israel gathered before King Solomon  
at the feast, in the month of Ethanim, which is the seventh month.

## 1 Kings 8:3

Then all the elders of Israel arrived,  
and the priests carried the ark.

## 1 Kings 8:4

They brought up the ark of the Lord,  
the tent of meeting, and all the sacred utensils which were in the tent;  
and the priests and the Levites carried them up.

## 1 Kings 8:5

And King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel,  
who were gathered to him, were with him before the ark,  
offering so many sheep and oxen  
that they could not be counted or numbered.

## 1 Kings 8:6

Then the priests placed the ark of the covenant of the Lord in its position,  
within the inner sanctuary of the house,  
to the Most Holy Place,  
beneath the wings of the cherubim.

## 1 Kings 8:7

For the cherubim spread their wings over the location of the ark,  
and the cherubim provided a covering over the ark and its poles from above.

## 1 Kings 8:8

But the poles were so long  
that the ends of the poles could be seen from the holy place in front of the inner sanctuary,  
but they could not be seen outside;  
they remain there to this day.

## 1 Kings 8:9

There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets of stone  
which Moses placed there at Horeb,  
where the Lord made a covenant with the sons of Israel  
when they came out of the land of Egypt.

---

## 1 Kings 8:10

And when the priests exited the holy place,  
the cloud filled the house of the Lord,

## 1 Kings 8:11

so that the priests were unable to stand and minister due to the cloud,  
for the glory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord.

---

## 1 Kings 8:12

Then Solomon said,  
“The Lord has declared that He would dwell in the thick cloud.

## 1 Kings 8:13

I have indeed built You a magnificent house,  
a place for Your dwelling forever.”

---

## 1 Kings 8:14

Then the king turned to bless all the assembly of Israel,  
while all the assembly of Israel stood.

## 1 Kings 8:15

He said,  
“Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,  
who spoke with His mouth to my father David,  
and has fulfilled it with His hands, saying,

## 1 Kings 8:16

‘Since the day that I brought My people Israel out of Egypt,  
I did not choose a city from all the tribes of Israel in which to build a house  
so that My name would be there,  
but I chose David to be over My people Israel.’

## 1 Kings 8:17

Now it was in the heart of my father David  
to construct a house for the name of the Lord, the God of Israel.

## 1 Kings 8:18

But the Lord said to my father David,  
‘I saw it was in your heart to build a house for My name, and you have done well to have this desire.

## 1 Kings 8:19

But, you shall not build the house,  
for your son who will be born to you,  
will build the house for My name.’

## 1 Kings 8:20

Now the Lord has fulfilled His word which He spoke,  
for I have risen in place of my father David and sit on the throne of Israel,  
as the Lord promised,  
and I have built the house for the name of the Lord, the God of Israel.

## 1 Kings 8:21

And I have set there a place for the ark,  
in which is the covenant of the Lord,  
which He made with our fathers when He brought them out of the land of Egypt.”

---

## 1 Kings 8:22

Then Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord  
in the presence of all the assembly of Israel,  
and lifted his hands toward heaven.

## 1 Kings 8:23

He said,  
“O Lord, God of Israel,  
there is no God like You in heaven above or on earth beneath,  
keeping the covenant and showing faithfulness to Your servants  
who walk before You with all their heart,

## 1 Kings 8:24

who have kept with Your servant, my father David, that which You promised him;  
You have spoken with Your mouth and have fulfilled it with Your hand, as it is this day.

## 1 Kings 8:25

Now then, Lord, the God of Israel,  
keep with Your servant David my father what You have promised him, saying,  
‘You shall not lack a man to sit on the throne of Israel,  
if only your sons are careful about their way,  
to walk before Me as you have walked.’

## 1 Kings 8:26

Now then, God of Israel,  
let Your word be confirmed,  
which You have spoken to Your servant, my father David.

---

## 1 Kings 8:27

But can God truly dwell on the earth?  
Behold, heaven and the highest heavens cannot contain You,  
how much less this house which I have built!

## 1 Kings 8:28

Yet, please turn Your attention to the prayer of Your servant  
and to his plea, Lord my God,  
to listen to the cry and to the prayer  
which Your servant prays before You today,

## 1 Kings 8:29

so that Your eyes may be open toward this house day and night,  
toward the place of which You have said, ‘My name shall be there,’  
to listen to the prayer which Your servant will pray toward this place.

## 1 Kings 8:30

And listen to the plea of Your servant and of Your people Israel  
when they pray toward this place;  
hear in heaven Your dwelling place;  
and when You hear, forgive.

---

## 1 Kings 8:31

If someone sins against his neighbour and is required to take an oath,  
and he comes and swears before Your altar in this house,

## 1 Kings 8:32

then hear in heaven and act, judging Your servants,  
condemning the wicked by bringing his way on his own head,  
and justifying the righteous by giving him according to his righteousness.

---

## 1 Kings 8:33

When Your people Israel are defeated before an enemy  
because they have sinned against You,  
if they turn to You again and confess Your name and pray  
and plead with You in this house,

## 1 Kings 8:34

then hear in heaven, forgive the sin of Your people Israel,  
and restore them to the land which You gave to their fathers.

---

## 1 Kings 8:35

When the skies are closed and there is no rain  
because they have sinned against You,  
and they pray toward this place and confess Your name  
and turn from their sin when You afflict them,

## 1 Kings 8:36

then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of Your servants and of Your people Israel;  
indeed, teach them the good way in which they are to walk.  
And send rain on Your land, which You have given to Your people as an inheritance.

---

## 1 Kings 8:37

If there is famine in the land,  
if there is pestilence, or blight or mildew,  
locusts or grasshoppers,  
if their enemy besieges them in the land of their cities,  
whatever plague, whatever sickness there is,

## 1 Kings 8:38

whatever prayer or plea is made by anyone or by all Your people Israel,  
each knowing the affliction of his own heart,  
and spreading his hands toward this house,

## 1 Kings 8:39

then hear in heaven Your dwelling place, and forgive,  
and act and give to each one according to all his ways,  
whose heart You know—for You alone know the hearts of all mankind—

## 1 Kings 8:40

so that they may fear You all the days that they live in the land  
which You have given to our fathers.

---

## 1 Kings 8:41

Also concerning the foreigner who is not of Your people Israel,  
when he comes from a distant country for the sake of Your name

## 1 Kings 8:42

(for they will hear of Your great name, and Your mighty hand, and Your outstretched arm),  
when he comes and prays toward this house,

## 1 Kings 8:43

hear in heaven Your dwelling place,  
and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to You,  
so that all the peoples of the earth may know Your name,  
to fear You as do Your people Israel,  
and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by Your name.

---

## 1 Kings 8:44

When Your people go out to battle against their enemy,  
by whatever way You send them,  
and they pray to the Lord toward the city You have chosen  
and the house I have built for Your name,

## 1 Kings 8:45

then hear in heaven their prayer and their pleading,  
and support their cause.

---

## 1 Kings 8:46

When they sin against You (for there is no one who does not sin),  
and You are angry with them and turn them over to the enemy,  
so that they are taken away captive to the land of the enemy,  
far off or near;

## 1 Kings 8:47

if they take it to heart in the land where they have been taken captive,  
and repent and plead with You in the land of their captors, saying,  
‘We have sinned and done wrong, we have acted wickedly’;

## 1 Kings 8:48

if they return to You with all their heart and all their soul  
in the land of their enemies who have taken them captive,  
and pray to You toward their land which You have given to their fathers,  
the city which You have chosen, and the house which I have built for Your name,

## 1 Kings 8:49

then hear in heaven Your dwelling place their prayer and their pleading,  
and support their cause,

## 1 Kings 8:50

and forgive Your people who have sinned against You,  
and all their offences which they have committed against You,  
and make them objects of compassion before those who have taken them captive,  
so that they will have compassion on them.

## 1 Kings 8:51

For they are Your people and Your inheritance  
whom You brought out of Egypt, from the midst of the iron furnace—

## 1 Kings 8:52

so that Your eyes may be open to the plea of Your servant  
and to the plea of Your people Israel,  
to listen to them whenever they call to You.

## 1 Kings 8:53

For You have separated them from all the peoples of the earth as Your inheritance,  
just as You spoke through Moses Your servant,  
when You brought our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord God.”

---

## 1 Kings 8:54

When Solomon had finished praying this entire prayer and plea to the Lord,  
he got up from in front of the altar of the Lord,  
from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread toward heaven.

## 1 Kings 8:55

And he rose and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying,

## 1 Kings 8:56

“Blessed be the Lord, who has given rest to His people Israel,  
in accordance with everything that He promised;  
not one word has failed of all His good promise,  
which He promised through Moses His servant.

## 1 Kings 8:57

May the Lord our God be with us, as He was with our fathers;  
may He not leave us nor abandon us,

## 1 Kings 8:58

so that He may guide our hearts to Himself,  
to walk in all His ways  
and to keep His commandments, His statutes, and His ordinances,  
which He commanded our fathers.

## 1 Kings 8:59

And may these words of mine, with which I have pleaded before the Lord,  
be near to the Lord our God day and night,  
so that He may support the cause of His servant  
and the cause of His people Israel, as each day requires,

## 1 Kings 8:60

so that all the peoples of the earth may know  
that the Lord is God; there is none else.

## 1 Kings 8:61

Let your heart therefore be wholly devoted to the Lord our God,  
to walk in His statutes and to keep His commandments, as on this day.”

---

## 1 Kings 8:62

Then the king, along with all Israel, offered sacrifices before the Lord.

## 1 Kings 8:63

Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace offerings,  
which he offered to the Lord, twenty-two thousand oxen and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep.  
So the king and all the sons of Israel dedicated the house of the Lord.

## 1 Kings 8:64

On the same day the king consecrated the middle of the courtyard  
that was in front of the house of the Lord,  
because there he offered the burnt offering, the grain offering, and the fat of the peace offerings;  
for the bronze altar that was before the Lord was too small  
to hold the burnt offering, the grain offering, and the fat of the peace offerings.

## 1 Kings 8:65

So Solomon held the feast at that time,  
and all Israel with him,  
a great assembly from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of Egypt,  
before the Lord our God, for seven days and another seven days, fourteen days in all.

## 1 Kings 8:66

On the eighth day he sent the people away, and they blessed the king.  
Then they went to their tents joyful and happy of heart  
because of all the goodness that the Lord had shown to David His servant, and to His people Israel.
