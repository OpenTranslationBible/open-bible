# 1 Kings Chapter 15

## 1 Kings 15:1

In the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, son of Nebat,  
Abijam ascended to the throne over Judah.

## 1 Kings 15:2

He ruled for three years in Jerusalem,  
and his mother was Maacah, daughter of Abishalom.

## 1 Kings 15:3

He followed in all the transgressions of his father, which he had committed before him,  
and his heart was not fully devoted to the Lord his God,  
unlike the heart of his ancestor David.

## 1 Kings 15:4

Yet for David’s sake, the Lord his God provided a lamp in Jerusalem,  
by raising up his son after him and establishing Jerusalem;

## 1 Kings 15:5

because David acted rightly in the eyes of the Lord,  
and did not deviate from anything He commanded him all the days of his life,  
except in the matter concerning Uriah the Hittite.

## 1 Kings 15:6

And there was ongoing conflict between Rehoboam and Jeroboam throughout his life.

## 1 Kings 15:7

As for the other deeds of Abijam and all that he accomplished,  
are they not recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?  
And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.

## 1 Kings 15:8

Abijam rested with his ancestors,  
and they buried him in the city of David;  
and his son Asa succeeded him as king.

## 1 Kings 15:9

In the twentieth year of Jeroboam's reign over Israel,  
Asa became king over Judah.

## 1 Kings 15:10

He ruled for forty-one years in Jerusalem,  
and his mother was Maacah, daughter of Abishalom.

## 1 Kings 15:11

Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord,  
like his forefather David.

## 1 Kings 15:12

He also expelled the male shrine prostitutes from the land,  
and removed all the idols that his ancestors had made.

## 1 Kings 15:13

And he also removed Maacah his mother from her position as queen mother,  
because she had made an offensive image as an Asherah;  
and Asa cut down her offensive image and burned it at the brook Kidron.

## 1 Kings 15:14

But the high places were not eliminated;  
nevertheless, the heart of Asa was fully devoted to the Lord all his days.

## 1 Kings 15:15

And he brought into the house of the Lord  
the holy offerings of his father and his own holy offerings:  
silver, gold, and utensils.

## 1 Kings 15:16

There was ongoing conflict and war between Asa and Baasha, king of Israel, throughout their reigns.

## 1 Kings 15:17

And Baasha, king of Israel, went up against Judah  
and fortified Ramah,  
to prevent anyone from going out or coming in to Asa, king of Judah.

## 1 Kings 15:18

Then Asa took all the silver and the gold  
that were left in the treasuries of the house of the Lord and the treasuries of the king’s house,  
and handed them over to his servants;  
and King Asa sent them to Ben-hadad, son of Tabrimmon, son of Hezion, king of Aram,  
who lived in Damascus, saying,

## 1 Kings 15:19

“Let there be a treaty between you and me,  
as between my father and your father.  
Behold, I have sent you a gift of silver and gold.  
Go, break your treaty with Baasha, king of Israel, so that he will withdraw from me.”

## 1 Kings 15:20

So Ben-hadad listened to King Asa  
and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel,  
and they conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel-beth-maacah,  
all Chinneroth, besides all the land of Naphtali.

## 1 Kings 15:21

Upon hearing of it, Baasha ceased fortifying Ramah and stayed in Tirzah.

## 1 Kings 15:22

Then King Asa made a proclamation to all Judah—none was exempt—  
and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber with which Baasha had built,  
and King Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin and Mizpah.

---

## 1 Kings 15:23

Now as for all the acts of Asa and all his might and everything that he did,  
and the cities which he built,  
are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?  
But in the time of his old age, he suffered from a disease in his feet.

## 1 Kings 15:24

And Asa rested with his ancestors and was buried with his fathers in the city of his father David;  
and his son Jehoshaphat succeeded him as king.

---

## 1 Kings 15:25

Nadab, son of Jeroboam, became king over Israel in the second year of Asa, king of Judah,  
and he ruled over Israel for two years.

## 1 Kings 15:26

He did what was evil in the eyes of the Lord,  
and followed in the ways of his father and in his sin, into which he led Israel.

## 1 Kings 15:27

Then Baasha, son of Ahijah of the house of Issachar, conspired against him,  
and Baasha struck him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines,  
while Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon.

## 1 Kings 15:28

Thus, Baasha killed him in the third year of Asa, king of Judah,  
and took over the throne.

## 1 Kings 15:29

And as soon as he became king,  
he struck down all the household of Jeroboam.  
He did not leave to Jeroboam anyone alive,  
but wiped them out completely,  
according to the word of the Lord, which He had spoken through His servant Ahijah the Shilonite,

## 1 Kings 15:30

because of the sins of Jeroboam,  
which he committed, and into which he led Israel,  
because of his provocation with which he provoked the Lord God of Israel to anger.

---

## 1 Kings 15:31

Now as for the rest of the acts of Nadab and everything that he did,  
are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

## 1 Kings 15:32

And there was continuous conflict between Asa and Baasha, king of Israel, throughout their reigns.

---

## 1 Kings 15:33

In the third year of Asa, king of Judah,  
Baasha, son of Ahijah, became king over all Israel at Tirzah,  
and reigned for twenty-four years.

## 1 Kings 15:34

He did what was evil in the eyes of the Lord,  
and followed in the ways of Jeroboam and in his sin, into which he led Israel.
