# 1 Kings Chapter 6

## 1 Kings 6:1

In the four hundred and eightieth year after the sons of Israel departed from the land of Egypt,  
during the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel,  
in the month of Ziv (which is the second month),  
he commenced the construction of the house of the Lord.

## 1 Kings 6:2

The house which King Solomon built for the Lord was sixty cubits in length,  
twenty cubits in width,  
and thirty cubits in height.

## 1 Kings 6:3

The porch in front of the nave of the house was twenty cubits in length,  
in line with the width of the house,  
and ten cubits deep in front of the house.

## 1 Kings 6:4

And he made windows for the house with artistic frames.

## 1 Kings 6:5

He also built against the wall of the house an annex  
around the walls of the house, both of the nave and the inner sanctuary;  
and he made side chambers all around.

## 1 Kings 6:6

The lowest floor was five cubits wide,  
the middle was six cubits wide,  
and the third was seven cubits wide;  
for he made offsets on the wall of the house all around,  
so that the beams would not be inserted into the walls of the house.

## 1 Kings 6:7

The house was built of stone prepared at the quarry,  
and no hammer or axe or any iron tool was heard in the house while it was being built.

## 1 Kings 6:8

The doorway for the lowest side chamber was on the right side of the house;  
and they would go up by winding stairs to the middle floor,  
and from the middle to the third.

## 1 Kings 6:9

Thus, he constructed the house and completed it;  
and he covered the house with beams and planks of cedar.

## 1 Kings 6:10

He also built the side chambers against the whole house,  
each five cubits high;  
and they were attached to the house with timbers of cedar.

## 1 Kings 6:11

Then the Lord came to Solomon, saying,

## 1 Kings 6:12

“As for this house which you are building,  
if you walk in My statutes,  
carry out My ordinances,  
and keep all My commandments by walking in them,  
then I will fulfil My word with you,  
which I spoke to your father David.

## 1 Kings 6:13

And I will reside among the sons of Israel,  
and will not forsake My people Israel.”

---

## 1 Kings 6:14

Thus, Solomon constructed the house and completed it.

## 1 Kings 6:15

He built the walls of the house on the inside with cedar;  
from the floor of the house to the ceiling he overlaid it with wood on the inside,  
and he overlaid the floor of the house with boards of juniper.

## 1 Kings 6:16

He also constructed a section of twenty cubits at the rear of the house with boards of cedar  
from the floor to the ceiling;  
he built them on the inside as an inner sanctuary,  
known as the Most Holy Place.

## 1 Kings 6:17

The nave, which is the area in front of the inner sanctuary,  
was forty cubits long.

## 1 Kings 6:18

The interior of the house was adorned with cedar,  
carved in the shape of gourds and open flowers;  
everything was cedar,  
and no stone was visible.

## 1 Kings 6:19

Then he prepared an inner sanctuary within the house  
to place the ark of the covenant of the Lord.

## 1 Kings 6:20

The inner sanctuary measured twenty cubits in length,  
twenty cubits in width,  
and twenty cubits in height,  
and he overlaid it with pure gold.  
He also covered the altar with cedar.

## 1 Kings 6:21

So Solomon overlaid the inside of the house with pure gold.  
He drew chains of gold across the front of the inner sanctuary,  
and he overlaid it with gold.

## 1 Kings 6:22

He overlaid the entire house with gold,  
until all the house was finished.  
He also overlaid the entire altar that was by the inner sanctuary with gold.

## 1 Kings 6:23

Within the inner sanctuary, he crafted two cherubim of olive wood,  
each ten cubits high.

## 1 Kings 6:24

Five cubits was the length of one wing of the cherub,  
and five cubits the length of the other wing of the cherub;  
from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other was ten cubits.

## 1 Kings 6:25

The other cherub was ten cubits;  
both cherubim were of the same size and shape.

## 1 Kings 6:26

The height of one cherub was ten cubits,  
and the other cherub was the same height.

## 1 Kings 6:27

He placed the cherubim in the inner house,  
and the wings of the cherubim were spread out,  
so that the wing of one was touching one wall,  
and the wing of the other cherub was touching the other wall,  
and their wings were touching one another in the centre of the house.

## 1 Kings 6:28

He also covered the cherubim with gold.

---

## 1 Kings 6:29

Then he carved all the walls of the house all around  
with carved engravings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers,  
from the inner room to the outer room.

## 1 Kings 6:30

He also overlaid the floor of the house with gold,  
from the inner room to the outer room.

---

## 1 Kings 6:31

For the entrance of the inner sanctuary, he made doors of olive wood,  
with the lintel and five-sided doorposts.

## 1 Kings 6:32

So he made two doors of olive wood,  
and he carved on them cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers,  
and overlaid them with gold;  
and he hammered gold on the cherubim and on the palm trees.

## 1 Kings 6:33

Likewise, he crafted four-sided doorposts of olive wood for the entrance of the nave,

## 1 Kings 6:34

and made two doors of cypress wood;  
the two leaves of one door turned on pivots,  
and the two leaves of the other door turned on pivots.

## 1 Kings 6:35

He carved cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers on them,  
and overlaid them with gold evenly applied on the carved work.

---

## 1 Kings 6:36

And he constructed the inner courtyard with three rows of cut stone  
and a row of cedar beams.

---

## 1 Kings 6:37

In the fourth year, during the month of Ziv, the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid.

## 1 Kings 6:38

In the eleventh year, in the month of Bul (which is the eighth month),  
the house was finished throughout all its parts and according to all its plans.  
So he built it in seven years.
