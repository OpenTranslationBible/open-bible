# 1 Kings Chapter 5

## 1 Kings 5:1

Now Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon,  
when he heard that they had anointed him king in the place of his father,  
for Hiram had always been a friend to David.

## 1 Kings 5:2

Solomon then messaged Hiram, saying,

## 1 Kings 5:3

“You know that my father David was not able to build a house for the name of the Lord his God  
because of the wars which surrounded him,  
until the Lord put them under the soles of his feet.

## 1 Kings 5:4

But now the Lord my God has given me rest on every side;  
there is neither adversary nor misfortune.

## 1 Kings 5:5

So behold, I intend to build a house for the name of the Lord my God,  
just as the Lord spoke to my father David, saying,  
‘Your son, whom I will put on your throne in your place,  
he shall build the house for My name.’

## 1 Kings 5:6

Now then, command that they cut cedars for me from Lebanon,  
and my servants will be with your servants;  
and I will give you wages for your servants  
according to whatever you say.  
For you know that there is no one among us who knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians.”

## 1 Kings 5:7

When Hiram heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced greatly and said,  
“Blessed be the Lord today,  
who has given to David a wise son over this great people.”

## 1 Kings 5:8

So Hiram sent word to Solomon, saying,  
“I have heard your message which you have sent me;  
I will do what you desire concerning the cedar timber and the cypress timber.

## 1 Kings 5:9

My servants will bring them down from Lebanon to the sea;  
and I will make them into rafts to go by sea to the place where you direct me,  
and I will have them broken up there,  
and you shall carry them away.  
Then you shall accomplish my desire  
by giving food to my household.”

## 1 Kings 5:10

So Hiram gave Solomon all the cedar and cypress timber that he desired.

## 1 Kings 5:11

Solomon then gave Hiram twenty thousand kors of wheat as food for his household,  
and twenty kors of beaten oil.  
Solomon would give this to Hiram year by year.

## 1 Kings 5:12

And the Lord gave wisdom to Solomon, just as He promised him;  
and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon,  
and the two of them made a covenant.

## 1 Kings 5:13

Now King Solomon conscripted forced labourers from all Israel,  
and the forced labourers numbered thirty thousand men.

## 1 Kings 5:14

He sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month in shifts;  
they were in Lebanon for a month and two months at home.  
And Adoniram was over the forced labour.

## 1 Kings 5:15

Now Solomon had seventy thousand men who carried loads,  
and eighty thousand who quarried stone in the mountains,

## 1 Kings 5:16

besides Solomon’s chief officers who were over the work,  
three thousand three hundred who ruled over the people doing the work.

## 1 Kings 5:17

Then the king commanded,  
and they quarried large stones, valuable stones,  
to lay the foundation of the house with cut stones.

## 1 Kings 5:18

So Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders and the men of Gebal cut the stones,  
and they prepared the timber and the stones to build the house.
