# 1 Kings Chapter 7

## 1 Kings 7:1

Now Solomon built his own house over thirteen years,  
and he finished all his house.

## 1 Kings 7:2

He built the House of the Forest of Lebanon;  
its length was one hundred cubits, its width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits,  
on four rows of cedar pillars with cedar beams on the pillars.

## 1 Kings 7:3

It was roofed with cedar above the chambers  
that were on the forty-five pillars, fifteen in each row.

## 1 Kings 7:4

There were artistic window frames in three rows,  
and window was opposite window in three tiers.

## 1 Kings 7:5

All the doorways and doorposts had squared artistic frames,  
and window was opposite window in three tiers.

## 1 Kings 7:6

Then he made the Hall of Pillars;  
its length was fifty cubits and its width thirty cubits,  
and a porch was in front with pillars and a canopy in front of them.

## 1 Kings 7:7

He made the Hall of the Throne where he was to judge, the Hall of Judgement,  
and it was panelled with cedar from floor to ceiling.

## 1 Kings 7:8

His house where he was to dwell,  
in the other courtyard inward from the hall, was of the same workmanship.  
He also made a house like this hall for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom Solomon had taken as a wife.

## 1 Kings 7:9

All these were made of precious stones,  
cut to size, sawed with saws inside and out,  
from the foundation to the eaves, and from the outside to the great court.

## 1 Kings 7:10

The foundation was of precious stones,  
large stones, stones of ten and eight cubits.

## 1 Kings 7:11

And above were precious stones, stone cut to size,  
and cedar.

## 1 Kings 7:12

So the great courtyard all around had three rows of cut stone  
and a row of cedar beams,  
like the inner courtyard of the house of the Lord, and the porch of the house.

## 1 Kings 7:13

At this time, King Solomon sent for Hiram to come from Tyre.

## 1 Kings 7:14

He was a widow’s son from the tribe of Naphtali,  
and his father was a man of Tyre, a bronze worker;  
and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill for doing any work in bronze.  
So he came to King Solomon and performed all his work.

## 1 Kings 7:15

He cast two pillars of bronze;  
eighteen cubits was the height of one pillar,  
and a line of twelve cubits measured the circumference of both.

## 1 Kings 7:16

He made two capitals of molten bronze to set on the tops of the pillars;  
the height of one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits.

## 1 Kings 7:17

There were lattices of latticework and twisted threads of chainwork for the capitals  
which were on the tops of the pillars, seven for each capital.

## 1 Kings 7:18

So he made the pillars,  
and two rows of pomegranates all around on the one latticework  
to cover the capitals that were on top of the pillars; and he did the same for the other capital.

## 1 Kings 7:19

Now the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars in the porch were of lily design,  
four cubits.

## 1 Kings 7:20

And there were capitals on the two pillars even above the rounded section which was beside the latticework,  
and the pomegranates numbered two hundred in rows all around on each capital.

## 1 Kings 7:21

And he set up the pillars at the porch of the main hall;  
he set up the right pillar and named it Jachin,  
and he set up the left pillar and named it Boaz.

## 1 Kings 7:22

On the tops of the pillars was lily design.  
So the work of the pillars was finished.

---

## 1 Kings 7:23

He also made the Sea of cast metal, ten cubits from brim to brim, circular in shape,  
and five cubits high, and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference.

## 1 Kings 7:24

And under its brim gourds went around it,  
ten to a cubit, encircling the Sea all around;  
the gourds were cast in two rows when it was cast.

## 1 Kings 7:25

It stood on twelve oxen,  
three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east;  
and the Sea was set on top of them,  
and all their hindquarters turned inward.

## 1 Kings 7:26

It was a handbreadth thick,  
and its brim was made like the brim of a cup,  
like a lily blossom;  
it could hold two thousand baths.

---

## 1 Kings 7:27

Then he made the ten stands of bronze;  
the length of each stand was four cubits, its width four cubits, and its height three cubits.

## 1 Kings 7:28

And this was the design of the stands:  
they had borders, even borders between the frames;

## 1 Kings 7:29

and on the borders which were between the frames were lions, oxen, and cherubim.  
And on the frames there was a pedestal above,  
and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths of hanging work.

## 1 Kings 7:30

Now each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles,  
and its four feet had supports;  
beneath the basin were cast supports,  
at the side of each, wreaths.

## 1 Kings 7:31

Its opening inside the crown at the top was a cubit,  
and the opening was round, like a pedestal, a cubit and a half in diameter;  
and also on the opening there were engravings.  
And their borders were square, not round.

## 1 Kings 7:32

And the four wheels were underneath the borders,  
and the axles of the wheels were on the stand itself;  
the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half.

## 1 Kings 7:33

The workmanship of the wheels was like the workmanship of a chariot wheel.  
Their axles, their rims, their spokes, and their hubs were all cast.

## 1 Kings 7:34

Now there were four supports at the four corners of each stand;  
its supports were part of the stand itself.

## 1 Kings 7:35

On the top of the stand there was a circular form half a cubit high,  
and on the top of the stand its stays and its borders were part of it.

## 1 Kings 7:36

And he engraved on the plates of its stays and on its borders,  
cherubim, lions, and palm trees,  
according to the clear space on each,  
with wreaths all around.

## 1 Kings 7:37

He made the ten stands like this:  
all of them had one casting, one measure, and one form.

---

## 1 Kings 7:38

And he made ten basins of bronze, one basin for each of the ten stands;  
each basin held forty baths and was four cubits;  
and on each of the ten stands was one basin.

## 1 Kings 7:39

Then he set the stands,  
five on the right side of the house and five on the left side of the house;  
and he set the Sea on the right side of the house eastward toward the south.

## 1 Kings 7:40

Now Hiram made the basins, and the shovels, and the bowls.  
So Hiram finished doing all the work that he performed for King Solomon in the house of the Lord:

## 1 Kings 7:41

the two pillars and the two bowls of the capitals which were on the top of the two pillars,  
and the two latticeworks to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were on the top of the pillars;

## 1 Kings 7:42

and the four hundred pomegranates for the two latticeworks,  
two rows of pomegranates for each latticework to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were on the pillars;

## 1 Kings 7:43

as well as the ten stands with their ten basins;

## 1 Kings 7:44

and the large basin, known as the Sea, and the twelve oxen beneath it;

## 1 Kings 7:45

and the pots, the shovels, and the bowls.  
All these utensils which Hiram made for King Solomon in the house of the Lord were of polished bronze.

## 1 Kings 7:46

On the plain of the Jordan the king cast them,  
in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan.

## 1 Kings 7:47

Solomon left all the utensils unweighed,  
because they were too many;  
the weight of the bronze could not be determined.

---

## 1 Kings 7:48

Solomon also made all the furnishings that were in the house of the Lord:  
the golden altar and the golden table on which was the bread of the Presence;

## 1 Kings 7:49

and the lampstands, five on the right side and five on the left, in front of the inner sanctuary,  
of pure gold,  
with the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs of gold;

## 1 Kings 7:50

and the cups, the snuffers, the bowls, the spoons, and the firepans, of pure gold;  
and the hinges for the doors of the inner house,  
that is, for the Most Holy Place, and for the doors of the house, that is, of the nave, of gold.

---

## 1 Kings 7:51

So all the work that King Solomon performed in the house of the Lord was finished.  
And Solomon brought in the things that his father David had dedicated:  
the silver, the gold, and the utensils;  
and he put them in the treasuries of the house of the Lord.
