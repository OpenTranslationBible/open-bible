# 1 Kings Chapter 18

## 1 Kings 18:1

Now it happened after many days that the word of the Lord came to Elijah in the third year, saying,  
“Go, show yourself to Ahab, and I will send rain on the face of the earth.”

## 1 Kings 18:2

So Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. Now the famine was severe in Samaria.

## 1 Kings 18:3

And Ahab summoned Obadiah, who was in charge of the household.  
(Obadiah feared the Lord greatly.

## 1 Kings 18:4

For when Jezebel destroyed the prophets of the Lord,  
Obadiah took a hundred prophets and hid them by fifties in a cave,  
and provided them with bread and water.)

## 1 Kings 18:5

Then Ahab said to Obadiah,  
“Go through the land to all the springs of water and to all the valleys;  
perhaps we will find grass to keep the horses and mules alive,  
and not have to kill some of the livestock.”

## 1 Kings 18:6

So they divided the land between them to survey it;  
Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.

## 1 Kings 18:7

Now as Obadiah was on the way, behold, Elijah met him,  
and he recognised him and fell on his face and said,  
“Is it you, Elijah my master?”

## 1 Kings 18:8

And he said to him,  
“It is I. Go, say to your master, ‘Behold, Elijah is here.’”

## 1 Kings 18:9

But he said,  
“What sin have I committed, that you are handing your servant over to Ahab to put me to death?

## 1 Kings 18:10

As the Lord your God lives,  
there is no nation or kingdom where my master has not sent to search for you;  
and when they said, ‘He is not here,’  
he made the kingdom or nation swear that they could not find you.

## 1 Kings 18:11

And now you are saying,  
‘Go, say to your master, “Behold, Elijah is here.”’

## 1 Kings 18:12

And it will come about when I leave you  
that the Spirit of the Lord will carry you where I do not know,  
so when I come and tell Ahab and he does not find you, he will kill me,  
though I your servant have feared the Lord from my youth.

## 1 Kings 18:13

Has it not been reported to my master what I did  
when Jezebel killed the prophets of the Lord,  
that I hid a hundred prophets of the Lord by fifties in a cave,  
and provided them with bread and water?

## 1 Kings 18:14

Now you are saying,  
‘Go, say to your master, “Behold, Elijah is here”’;  
then he will kill me.”

## 1 Kings 18:15

But Elijah said,  
“As the Lord of hosts lives, before whom I stand,  
I will certainly show myself to him today.”

## 1 Kings 18:16

So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and informed him;  
and Ahab went to meet Elijah.

## 1 Kings 18:17

When Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him,  
“Is this you, the cause of disaster for Israel?”

## 1 Kings 18:18

He said,  
“I have not brought disaster to Israel, but you and your father’s house have,  
because you have abandoned the commandments of the Lord  
and you have followed the Baals.

## 1 Kings 18:19

Now then, send orders and gather to me all Israel at Mount Carmel,  
together with 450 prophets of Baal and 400 prophets of the Asherah,  
who eat at Jezebel’s table.”

---

## 1 Kings 18:20

So Ahab sent orders among all the sons of Israel  
and brought the prophets together at Mount Carmel.

## 1 Kings 18:21

Then Elijah approached all the people and said,  
“How long are you going to struggle between two choices?  
If the Lord is God, follow Him; but if Baal, follow him.”  
But the people did not answer him so much as a word.

## 1 Kings 18:22

Then Elijah said to the people,  
“I alone am left as a prophet of the Lord, while Baal’s prophets are 450 men.

## 1 Kings 18:23

Now have them give us two oxen;  
and let them choose the one ox for themselves and cut it up,  
and place it on the wood, but put no fire under it;  
and I will prepare the other ox and lay it on the wood, and I will not put fire under it.

## 1 Kings 18:24

Then you call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the Lord;  
and the God who answers by fire, He is God.”  
And all the people replied, “That is a good idea.”

## 1 Kings 18:25

So Elijah said to the prophets of Baal,  
“Choose the one ox for yourselves and prepare it first, since there are many of you,  
and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under the ox.”

## 1 Kings 18:26

Then they took the ox which was given to them and prepared it,  
and they called on the name of Baal from morning until noon, saying,  
“O Baal, answer us!”  
But there was no voice, and no one answered.  
And they limped about the altar which they had made.

## 1 Kings 18:27

At noon Elijah ridiculed them and said,  
“Call out with a loud voice, since he is a god;  
undoubtedly he is attending to business, or is on the way, or is on a journey;  
perhaps he is asleep and will wake up!”

## 1 Kings 18:28

So they cried out with a loud voice,  
and cut themselves according to their custom with swords and lances  
until the blood gushed out on them.

## 1 Kings 18:29

When midday was past, they raved until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice;  
but there was no voice, no answer, and no attention was paid.

---

## 1 Kings 18:30

Then Elijah said to all the people, “Come forward to me.”  
So all the people came forward to him.  
And he repaired the altar of the Lord which had been torn down.

## 1 Kings 18:31

Then Elijah took twelve stones,  
corresponding to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob,  
to whom the word of the Lord had come, saying,  
“Israel shall be your name.”

## 1 Kings 18:32

And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord;  
and he made a trench around the altar, large enough to hold two measures of seed.

## 1 Kings 18:33

Then he laid out the wood, and cut the ox in pieces and placed it on the wood.  
And he said,  
“Fill four jars with water and pour it on the burnt offering and on the wood.”

## 1 Kings 18:34

Then he said, “Do it a second time,” and they did it a second time.  
Then he said, “Do it a third time,” and they did it a third time.

## 1 Kings 18:35

So the water flowed around the altar,  
and he also filled the trench with water.

## 1 Kings 18:36

Then at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice,  
Elijah the prophet approached and said,  
“O Lord, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel,  
today let it be known that You are God in Israel  
and that I am Your servant, and that I have done all these things at Your word.

## 1 Kings 18:37

Answer me, Lord, answer me,  
so that this people may know that You, Lord, are God,  
and that You have turned their heart back.”

## 1 Kings 18:38

Then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt offering,  
the wood, the stones, and the dust,  
and it licked up the water that was in the trench.

## 1 Kings 18:39

When all the people saw this, they fell on their faces;  
and they said,  
“The Lord, He is God; the Lord, He is God!”

## 1 Kings 18:40

Then Elijah said to them,  
“Seize the prophets of Baal; do not let one of them escape.”  
So they seized them; and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon,  
and slaughtered them there.

---

## 1 Kings 18:41

Now Elijah said to Ahab,  
“Go up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of the roar of a heavy shower.”

## 1 Kings 18:42

So Ahab went up to eat and drink.  
But Elijah went up to the top of Carmel;  
and he bent down to the ground, and put his face between his knees.

## 1 Kings 18:43

And he said to his servant, “Go up now, look toward the sea.”  
So he went up and looked, and said, “There is nothing.”  
But he said, “Go back” seven times.

## 1 Kings 18:44

And when he returned the seventh time, he said,  
“Behold, a cloud as small as a person’s hand is coming up from the sea.”  
And Elijah said, “Go up, say to Ahab, ‘Prepare your chariot and go down,  
so that the heavy shower does not stop you.’”

## 1 Kings 18:45

Meanwhile the sky became dark with clouds and wind,  
and there was a heavy shower.  
And Ahab rode and went to Jezreel.

## 1 Kings 18:46

Then the hand of the Lord was on Elijah,  
and he tucked his cloak into his belt and outran Ahab to Jezreel.
