# 1 Kings Chapter 19

## 1 Kings 19:1

Now Ahab told Jezebel everything that Elijah had done,  
and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword.

## 1 Kings 19:2

Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying,  
“So may the gods do to me and more so,  
if by this time tomorrow I do not make your life like the life of one of them.”

## 1 Kings 19:3

And he was afraid, and got up and ran for his life,  
and came to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah,  
and he left his servant there.

## 1 Kings 19:4

But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness,  
and came and sat down under a broom tree;  
and he asked for himself to die, and said,  
“It is enough! Now, Lord, take my life, for I am no better than my fathers.”

## 1 Kings 19:5

Then he lay down and fell asleep under the broom tree;  
but behold, there was an angel touching him, and he said to him, “Arise, eat!”

## 1 Kings 19:6

Then he looked, and behold, there was at his head a loaf of bread baked on hot stones,  
and a jug of water.  
So he ate and drank, and lay down again.

## 1 Kings 19:7

But the angel of the Lord came back a second time and touched him, and said,  
“Arise, eat, because the journey is too long for you.”

## 1 Kings 19:8

So he arose and ate and drank,  
and he journeyed in the strength of that food for forty days and forty nights  
to Horeb, the mountain of God.

## 1 Kings 19:9

Then he came to a cave and spent the night there;  
and behold, the word of the Lord came to him, and He said to him,  
“What are you doing here, Elijah?”

## 1 Kings 19:10

He said,  
“I have been very zealous for the Lord, the God of armies;  
for the sons of Israel have abandoned Your covenant,  
torn down Your altars, and killed Your prophets with the sword.  
And I alone am left; and they sought to take my life.”

## 1 Kings 19:11

So He said,  
“Go out and stand on the mountain before the Lord.”  
And behold, the Lord was passing by!  
And a great and powerful wind was tearing out the mountains  
and breaking the rocks in pieces before the Lord;  
but the Lord was not in the wind.  
And after the wind, an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake.

## 1 Kings 19:12

And after the earthquake, a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire.  
And after the fire, a sound of a gentle blowing.

## 1 Kings 19:13

When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his cloak and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave.  
And behold, a voice came to him and said,  
“What are you doing here, Elijah?”

## 1 Kings 19:14

Then he said,  
“I have been very zealous for the Lord, the God of armies;  
for the sons of Israel have abandoned Your covenant,  
torn down Your altars, and killed Your prophets with the sword.  
And I alone am left; and they sought to take my life.”

## 1 Kings 19:15

The Lord said to him,  
“Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus,  
and when you have arrived, you shall anoint Hazael king over Aram;

## 1 Kings 19:16

and Jehu the son of Nimshi you shall anoint king over Israel;  
and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah you shall anoint as prophet in your place.

## 1 Kings 19:17

And it shall come about that the one who escapes from the sword of Hazael, Jehu shall put to death,  
and the one who escapes from the sword of Jehu, Elisha shall put to death.

## 1 Kings 19:18

Yet I will leave seven thousand in Israel,  
all the knees that have not bowed to Baal and every mouth that has not kissed him.”

## 1 Kings 19:19

So he departed from there and found Elisha the son of Shaphat,  
while he was ploughing with twelve pairs of oxen in front of him,  
and he was with the twelfth.  
And Elijah passed by him and threw his cloak on him.

## 1 Kings 19:20

Then he left the oxen behind and ran after Elijah, and said,  
“Please let me kiss my father and my mother, then I will follow you.”  
And he said to him, “Go back, for what have I done to you?”

## 1 Kings 19:21

So he returned from following him,  
and took the pair of oxen and sacrificed them,  
and boiled their meat with the implements of the oxen,  
and gave it to the people, and they ate.  
Then he got up and followed Elijah, and served him.
