# 1 Kings Chapter 17

## 1 Kings 17:1

Now Elijah the Tishbite, who was among the settlers of Gilead, said to Ahab,  
“As the Lord, the God of Israel lives, before whom I stand,  
there shall certainly be neither dew nor rain during these years, except by my word.”

## 1 Kings 17:2

Then a message from the Lord came to him, saying,

## 1 Kings 17:3

“Go away from here and turn eastward,  
and hide yourself by the brook Cherith, which is east of the Jordan.

## 1 Kings 17:4

And it shall be that you will drink from the brook,  
and I have commanded the ravens to provide food for you there.”

## 1 Kings 17:5

So he went and did according to the word of the Lord,  
for he went and lived by the brook Cherith, which is east of the Jordan.

## 1 Kings 17:6

The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning,  
and bread and meat in the evening,  
and he drank from the brook.

## 1 Kings 17:7

But it happened after a while that the brook dried up,  
because there was no rain in the land.

## 1 Kings 17:8

Then a message from the Lord came to him, saying,

## 1 Kings 17:9

“Arise, go to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and stay there.  
Behold, I have commanded a widow there to provide food for you.”

## 1 Kings 17:10

So he arose and went to Zarephath,  
and when he came to the entrance of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks.  
And he called to her and said,  
“Please bring me a little water in a cup, so that I may drink.”

## 1 Kings 17:11

As she was going to get it, he called to her and said,  
“Please bring me a piece of bread in your hand as well.”

## 1 Kings 17:12

But she said,  
“As the Lord your God lives,  
I have no food, only a handful of flour in the bowl and a little oil in the jar.  
And behold, I am gathering a few sticks so that I may go in and prepare it for me and my son,  
so that we may eat it and die.”

## 1 Kings 17:13

Then Elijah said to her,  
“Do not fear; go, do as you have said.  
But first make a little bread cake for me from it, and bring it out to me,  
and afterward you may make one for yourself and your son.

## 1 Kings 17:14

For this is what the Lord, the God of Israel says:  
‘The bowl of flour shall not be used up,  
nor shall the jar of oil become empty,  
until the day that the Lord provides rain on the face of the land.’”

## 1 Kings 17:15

So she went and did everything in accordance with the word of Elijah,  
and she and he and her household ate for many days.

## 1 Kings 17:16

The bowl of flour was not used up,  
nor did the jar of oil become empty,  
in accordance with the word of the Lord which He spoke through Elijah.

## 1 Kings 17:17

Now it happened after these things that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, became sick.  
And his illness was very severe, until there was no breath left in him.

## 1 Kings 17:18

So she said to Elijah,  
“What do I have to do with you, man of God?  
You have come to me to bring my guilt to remembrance and to put my son to death!”

## 1 Kings 17:19

But he said to her,  
“Give me your son.”  
Then he took him from her arms and carried him up to the upstairs room where he was staying,  
and laid him on his own bed.

## 1 Kings 17:20

And he called to the Lord and said,  
“O Lord my God, have You also brought tragedy to the widow with whom I am staying,  
by causing her son to die?”

## 1 Kings 17:21

Then he stretched himself out over the boy three times,  
and called to the Lord and said,  
“O Lord my God, please let this boy’s life return to him.”

## 1 Kings 17:22

And the Lord listened to the voice of Elijah,  
and the life of the boy returned to him and he revived.

## 1 Kings 17:23

Elijah took the boy and brought him down from the upstairs room into the house,  
and gave him to his mother; and Elijah said,  
“See, your son is alive.”

## 1 Kings 17:24

Then the woman said to Elijah,  
“Now I know that you are a man of God,  
and that the word of the Lord in your mouth is truth.”
