# 1 Kings Chapter 3

## 1 Kings 3:1

Then Solomon formed a marriage alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt,  
and took Pharaoh’s daughter and brought her to the city of David,  
until he had finished building his own house,  
and the house of the Lord, and the wall around Jerusalem.

## 1 Kings 3:2

The people were still sacrificing on the high places,  
because no house had yet been built for the name of the Lord.

## 1 Kings 3:3

Now Solomon loved the Lord,  
walking in the statutes of his father David,  
except that he sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.

---

## 1 Kings 3:4

And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there,  
for that was the great high place;  
Solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar.

## 1 Kings 3:5

In Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream at night;  
and God said,  
“Ask what you wish Me to give you.”

## 1 Kings 3:6

Then Solomon said,  
“You have shown great kindness to Your servant David my father,  
according as he walked before You in truth,  
in righteousness and uprightness of heart toward You;  
and You have reserved this great kindness for him,  
that You have given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.

## 1 Kings 3:7

Now, Lord my God,  
You have made Your servant king in place of my father David,  
yet I am only a little child;  
I do not know how to go out or come in.

## 1 Kings 3:8

And Your servant is in the midst of Your people whom You have chosen,  
a great people who are too many to be numbered or counted.

## 1 Kings 3:9

So give Your servant an understanding heart to judge Your people,  
to discern between good and evil.  
For who is capable of judging this great people of Yours?”

## 1 Kings 3:10

Now it was pleasing in the sight of the Lord  
that Solomon had asked this thing.

## 1 Kings 3:11

God said to him,  
“Because you have asked this thing,  
and have not asked for yourself long life,  
nor have asked riches for yourself,  
nor have you asked for the life of your enemies,  
but have asked for yourself discernment to understand justice,

## 1 Kings 3:12

Behold, I have done according to your words.  
Behold, I have given you a wise and discerning heart,  
so that there has been no one like you before you,  
nor shall one like you arise after you.

## 1 Kings 3:13

I have also given you what you have not asked,  
both riches and honour,  
so that there will not be anyone among the kings like you all your days.

## 1 Kings 3:14

And if you walk in My ways,  
keeping My statutes and commandments,  
as your father David walked,  
then I will lengthen your days.”

## 1 Kings 3:15

Then Solomon awoke, and behold, it was a dream.  
And he came to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord,  
and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings,  
and held a feast for all his servants.

## 1 Kings 3:16

Then two women who were prostitutes came to the king and stood before him.

## 1 Kings 3:17

The one woman said,  
“Pardon me, my lord:  
this woman and I live in the same house;  
and I gave birth to a child while she was in the house.

## 1 Kings 3:18

On the third day after I gave birth, this woman also gave birth to a child.  
We were together;  
there was no stranger with us in the house,  
only the two of us.

## 1 Kings 3:19

And this woman’s son died in the night,  
because she lay on him.

## 1 Kings 3:20

So she got up in the middle of the night  
and took my son from beside me while your servant was asleep,  
and laid him in her arms,  
and laid her dead son in my arms.

## 1 Kings 3:21

When I got up in the morning to nurse my son, behold, he was dead;  
but when I examined him closely in the morning,  
behold, he was not my son, the one whom I had borne.”

## 1 Kings 3:22

Then the other woman said,  
“No! For the living one is my son, and the dead one is your son.”  
But the first woman said,  
“No! For the dead one is your son, and the living one is my son.”  
Thus they spoke before the king.

---

## 1 Kings 3:23

Then the king said,  
“This one says, ‘This is my son, the living one, and your son is the dead one’;  
and the other says, ‘No! For your son is the dead one, and my son is the living one.’”

## 1 Kings 3:24

Then the king said,  
“Bring me a sword.”  
So they brought a sword before the king.

## 1 Kings 3:25

And the king said,  
“Cut the living child in two,  
and give half to the one and half to the other.”

## 1 Kings 3:26

Then the woman whose child was the living one spoke to the king,  
for she was deeply stirred over her son, and said,  
“Pardon me, my lord,  
give her the living child, and by no means kill him!”  
But the other said,  
“He shall neither be mine nor yours; cut him!”

## 1 Kings 3:27

Then the king replied,  
“Give the first woman the living child, and by no means kill him.  
She is his mother.”

---

## 1 Kings 3:28

When all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had rendered,  
they feared the king,  
for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to administer justice.
