# 1 Kings Chapter 1

## 1 Kings 1:1

Now King David was old and advanced in years,  
and although they covered him with blankets, he could not keep warm.

## 1 Kings 1:2

So his servants said to him,  
“Let a young virgin be sought for my lord the king,  
and let her attend the king and lie in your arms,  
that my lord the king may be kept warm.”

## 1 Kings 1:3

So they searched for a beautiful young woman throughout all the territory of Israel,  
and they found Abishag the Shunammite,  
and brought her to the king.

## 1 Kings 1:4

The young woman was very beautiful,  
and she cared for the king and served him,  
but the king did not have relations with her.

## 1 Kings 1:5

Adonijah, the son of Haggith, took it upon himself to declare,  
“I will be king.”  
And he arranged for himself chariots and horsemen  
and fifty men to run before him.

## 1 Kings 1:6

His father had never rebuked him at any time by asking,  
“Why have you done this?”  
And he was also a very handsome man,  
and he was born after Absalom.

## 1 Kings 1:7

He conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest,  
and they followed Adonijah and supported him.

## 1 Kings 1:8

But Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada,  
Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and David’s mighty men were not with Adonijah.

---

## 1 Kings 1:9

And Adonijah sacrificed sheep and oxen and fattened cattle  
by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En-rogel.  
He invited all his brothers, the king’s sons,  
and all the men of Judah who were servants of the king.

## 1 Kings 1:10

Yet, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, the mighty men, and Solomon his brother were not invited.

---

## 1 Kings 1:11

Nathan approached Bathsheba, Solomon's mother, and said,  
“Have you not heard that Adonijah, the son of Haggith, has declared himself king,  
and David our lord is unaware of it?

## 1 Kings 1:12

Now come, let me give you advice,  
so that you may save your life and the life of your son Solomon.

## 1 Kings 1:13

Go immediately to King David and say to him,  
‘Did you not, my lord the king, swear to your maidservant, saying,  
“Surely Solomon your son shall be king after me,  
and he shall sit on my throne”?  
Why then has Adonijah become king?’

## 1 Kings 1:14

Then, while you are still speaking with the king,  
I will come in after you and confirm your words.”

---

## 1 Kings 1:15

So Bathsheba went to the king in the chamber.  
Now the king was very old,  
and Abishag the Shunammite was attending to the king.

## 1 Kings 1:16

Bathsheba bowed and prostrated herself before the king,  
and the king said, “What do you wish?”

## 1 Kings 1:17

She said to him,  
“My lord, you swore by the Lord your God to your maidservant,  
‘Surely Solomon your son shall be king after me,  
and he shall sit on my throne.’

## 1 Kings 1:18

But now, behold, Adonijah has become king,  
and you, my lord the king, do not know it.

## 1 Kings 1:19

And he has sacrificed oxen and fattened cattle and sheep in abundance,  
and has invited all the sons of the king,  
and Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander of the army,  
but he has not invited Solomon your servant.

## 1 Kings 1:20

And you, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you,  
to tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.

## 1 Kings 1:21

Otherwise it will come about,  
when my lord the king lies down with his fathers,  
that I and my son Solomon will be considered offenders.”

---

## 1 Kings 1:22

Now while she was still speaking with the king,  
Nathan the prophet came in.

## 1 Kings 1:23

And they told the king, saying,  
“Behold, Nathan the prophet is here.”  
And he came in before the king and prostrated himself before the king with his face to the ground.

## 1 Kings 1:24

And Nathan said,  
“My lord the king, have you said,  
‘Adonijah shall be king after me,  
and he shall sit on my throne’?

## 1 Kings 1:25

For he has gone down today and has sacrificed oxen and fattened cattle and sheep in abundance,  
and has invited all the king’s sons, and the commanders of the army, and Abiathar the priest;  
and behold, they are eating and drinking before him and saying,  
‘Long live King Adonijah!’

## 1 Kings 1:26

But me, even me your servant,  
and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada,  
and your servant Solomon—he has not invited.

## 1 Kings 1:27

Has this thing been done by my lord the king,  
and you have not informed your servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?”

---

## 1 Kings 1:28

King David responded,  
“Call Bathsheba to me.”  
So she came into the king’s presence and stood before the king.

## 1 Kings 1:29

And the king swore and said,  
“As the Lord lives, who has redeemed my life from all distress,

## 1 Kings 1:30

just as I swore to you by the Lord, the God of Israel, saying,  
‘Solomon your son shall be king after me,  
and he shall sit on my throne in my place,’  
I will indeed do so this day.”

## 1 Kings 1:31

Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the ground,  
and prostrated herself before the king and said,  
“May my lord King David have enduring life.”

---

## 1 Kings 1:32

Then King David said,  
“Call to me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.”  
So they came into the king’s presence.

## 1 Kings 1:33

And the king instructed them,  
“Take your lord’s servants with you,  
and have my son Solomon ride on my own mule,  
and bring him down to Gihon.

## 1 Kings 1:34

And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there as king over Israel,  
and blow the trumpet and say, ‘Long live King Solomon!’

## 1 Kings 1:35

Then you shall follow him up,  
and he shall come and sit on my throne and be king in my place;  
for I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and Judah.”

## 1 Kings 1:36

And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king and said,  
“Amen! May the Lord, the God of my lord the king, confirm it.

## 1 Kings 1:37

Just as the Lord has been with my lord the king,  
so may He be with Solomon,  
and elevate his throne beyond that of my lord King David.”

---

## 1 Kings 1:38

So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada,  
and the Cherethites and the Pelethites went down  
and had Solomon ride on King David’s mule,  
and brought him to Gihon.

## 1 Kings 1:39

Then Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the tent and anointed Solomon.  
Then they blew the trumpet,  
and all the people said, “Long live King Solomon!”

## 1 Kings 1:40

And all the people went up after him,  
and the people were playing flutes and rejoicing with great joy,  
so that the earth shook with their noise.

---

## 1 Kings 1:41

Now Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they finished feasting.  
When Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said,  
“Why is the city in such an uproar?”

## 1 Kings 1:42

As he was still speaking, Jonathan, the son of Abiathar the priest, arrived.  
And Adonijah said,  
“Come in, for you are a worthy man and surely bring good news.”

## 1 Kings 1:43

But Jonathan replied to Adonijah and said,  
“No! Our lord King David has made Solomon king.

## 1 Kings 1:44

And the king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet,  
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites and the Pelethites,  
and they have had him ride on the king’s mule.

## 1 Kings 1:45

And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon,  
and they have come up from there rejoicing, so that the city is in an uproar.  
This is the noise that you have heard.

## 1 Kings 1:46

Furthermore, Solomon now sits on the throne of the kingdom.

## 1 Kings 1:47

Additionally, the king’s servants came to bless our lord King David, saying,  
‘May your God make Solomon's name more esteemed than yours,  
and his throne greater than yours.’  
And the king bowed himself on the bed.

## 1 Kings 1:48

The king also said,  
“Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,  
who has granted one to sit on my throne this day while my eyes see it.”

---

## 1 Kings 1:49

Then all the guests of Adonijah were terrified,  
and they rose and each went his own way.

## 1 Kings 1:50

And Adonijah feared Solomon,  
and he arose and went and took hold of the horns of the altar.

## 1 Kings 1:51

Then it was reported to Solomon, saying,  
“Behold, Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon;  
for behold, he has taken hold of the horns of the altar, saying,  
‘Let King Solomon swear to me today that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.’”

## 1 Kings 1:52

And Solomon said,  
“If he is a worthy man, not one hair of him will fall to the ground;  
but if wickedness is found in him, he shall die.”

## 1 Kings 1:53

So King Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar.  
And he came and bowed to King Solomon,  
and Solomon said to him, “Go to your house.”
