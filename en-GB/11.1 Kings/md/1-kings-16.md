# 1 Kings Chapter 16

## 1 Kings 16:1

The message from the Lord was delivered to Jehu the son of Hanani concerning Baasha, saying,

## 1 Kings 16:2

“Since I exalted you from the dust and made you leader over My people Israel,  
but you have walked in the way of Jeroboam and have caused My people Israel to sin,  
provoking Me to anger with their sins,

## 1 Kings 16:3

behold, I am going to consume Baasha and his house,  
and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.

## 1 Kings 16:4

Anyone belonging to Baasha who dies in the city the dogs will eat,  
and anyone who dies in the field the birds of the sky will eat.”

## 1 Kings 16:5

Now as for the rest of the acts of Baasha, what he did and his might,  
are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

## 1 Kings 16:6

And Baasha lay down with his fathers and was buried in Tirzah,  
and his son Elah became king in his place.

## 1 Kings 16:7

Moreover, the word of the Lord through the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani  
also came against Baasha and his household,  
because of all the evil which he did in the sight of the Lord, provoking Him to anger with the work of his hands,  
by being like the house of Jeroboam, and because he struck it.

## 1 Kings 16:8

In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah,  
Elah the son of Baasha became king over Israel at Tirzah,  
and reigned for two years.

## 1 Kings 16:9

But his servant Zimri, commander of half his chariots, conspired against him.  
Now Elah was in Tirzah drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza,  
who was in charge of the household at Tirzah.

## 1 Kings 16:10

Then Zimri came in and struck him and put him to death in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah,  
and became king in his place.

## 1 Kings 16:11

When he became king, as soon as he sat on his throne,  
he struck down all the household of Baasha;  
he did not leave a single male, neither of his relatives nor of his friends.

## 1 Kings 16:12

So Zimri eliminated all the household of Baasha,  
in accordance with the word of the Lord which He spoke against Baasha through Jehu the prophet,

## 1 Kings 16:13

because of all the sins of Baasha and the sins of Elah his son,  
which they committed and into which they led Israel, provoking the Lord God of Israel to anger with their idols.

## 1 Kings 16:14

Now as for the rest of the acts of Elah and all that he did,  
are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

## 1 Kings 16:15

In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah,  
Zimri reigned for seven days at Tirzah.  
Now the people were camped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.

## 1 Kings 16:16

And the people who were camped heard it said,  
“Zimri has conspired and also struck down the king.”  
So all Israel made Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp.

## 1 Kings 16:17

Omri and all Israel with him advanced from Gibbethon and laid siege to Tirzah.

## 1 Kings 16:18

When Zimri saw that the city was taken,  
he went into the citadel of the king’s house,  
and burned the king’s house over him with fire, and died,

## 1 Kings 16:19

because of his sins which he committed,  
doing evil in the sight of the Lord,  
by walking in the way of Jeroboam,  
and in the sin which he committed, making Israel sin.

## 1 Kings 16:20

Now as for the rest of the acts of Zimri and his conspiracy which he carried out,  
are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

---

## 1 Kings 16:21

Then the people of Israel were divided into two factions:  
half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath,  
to make him king; the other half followed Omri.

## 1 Kings 16:22

But the people who followed Omri prevailed over the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath.  
So Tibni died, and Omri became king.

## 1 Kings 16:23

In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah,  
Omri became king over Israel and reigned for twelve years;  
he reigned six years at Tirzah.

## 1 Kings 16:24

And he bought the hill Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver,  
and he built on the hill, and named the city which he built Samaria,  
after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill.

## 1 Kings 16:25

But Omri did evil in the sight of the Lord,  
and acted more wickedly than all who were before him.

## 1 Kings 16:26

For he walked entirely in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,  
and in his sins into which he misled Israel,  
provoking the Lord God of Israel to anger with their worthless idols.

## 1 Kings 16:27

Now as for the rest of the acts of Omri which he did and his might which he showed,  
are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

## 1 Kings 16:28

And Omri lay down with his fathers and was buried in Samaria,  
and his son Ahab became king in his place.

---

## 1 Kings 16:29

Now Ahab the son of Omri became king over Israel in the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah,  
and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria for twenty-two years.

## 1 Kings 16:30

Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the Lord  
more than all who were before him.

## 1 Kings 16:31

And it came about, as though it had been a trivial thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,  
that he also took Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians as his wife,  
and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.

## 1 Kings 16:32

So he erected an altar for Baal in the house of Baal,  
which he built in Samaria.

## 1 Kings 16:33

Ahab also made the Asherah.  
So Ahab did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger  
than all the kings of Israel who were before him.

## 1 Kings 16:34

In his days Hiel the Bethelite built Jericho;  
he laid its foundations with the loss of Abiram his firstborn,  
and set up its gates with the loss of his youngest son Segub,  
in accordance with the word of the Lord, which He spoke through Joshua the son of Nun.
