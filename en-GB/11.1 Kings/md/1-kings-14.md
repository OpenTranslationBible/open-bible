# 1 Kings Chapter 14

## 1 Kings 14:1

During that period, Abijah, the son of Jeroboam, fell ill.

## 1 Kings 14:2

And Jeroboam said to his wife,  
“Please arise and disguise yourself so that they will not know that you are the wife of Jeroboam,  
and go to Shiloh.  
Behold, Ahijah the prophet is there,  
the one who said about me that I would be king over this people.

## 1 Kings 14:3

Take ten loaves of bread with you, some cakes, and a jug of honey,  
and go to him;  
he will tell you what will happen to the boy.”

## 1 Kings 14:4

So Jeroboam’s wife did so,  
and set out and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah.  
Now Ahijah could not see, for his eyes were dim because of his age.

## 1 Kings 14:5

But the Lord had said to Ahijah,  
“Behold, the wife of Jeroboam is coming to inquire of you concerning her son, for he is sick.  
You shall say such and such to her, for it will be when she arrives, that she will pretend to be someone else.”

## 1 Kings 14:6

So when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet coming in the doorway, he said,  
“Come in, wife of Jeroboam!  
Why are you pretending to be someone else?  
I have been sent to you with a harsh message.

## 1 Kings 14:7

Go, tell Jeroboam,  
‘This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, declares:  
“I raised you from among the people  
and appointed you as leader over My people Israel,

## 1 Kings 14:8

and tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you—  
yet you have not been like My servant David,  
who kept My commandments and followed Me with all his heart,  
to do only that which was right in My sight—

## 1 Kings 14:9

you have committed more evil than all who were before you,  
and you have gone and created other gods and cast metal images,  
provoking Me to anger, and have cast Me aside—

## 1 Kings 14:10

therefore, behold, I am bringing disaster on the house of Jeroboam,  
and will eliminate from Jeroboam every male person, both bond and free in Israel,  
and I will sweep away the house of Jeroboam, as one sweeps away refuse until it is all gone.

## 1 Kings 14:11

Those belonging to Jeroboam who die in the city, the dogs will consume,  
and those who die in the field, the birds of the sky will consume;  
for the Lord has spoken it.”’

## 1 Kings 14:12

Now you, arise, return to your house.  
When your feet enter the city, the child will pass away.

## 1 Kings 14:13

And all Israel will mourn for him and bury him,  
for he alone of Jeroboam’s family will come to the grave,  
because in him something good was found toward the Lord, the God of Israel,  
in the house of Jeroboam.

## 1 Kings 14:14

Moreover, the Lord will raise up for Himself a king over Israel  
who will eliminate the house of Jeroboam on that day.  
Now and from now on!

## 1 Kings 14:15

For the Lord will strike Israel, just as the reed shakes in the water;  
and He will uproot Israel from this good land which He gave to their fathers,  
and will scatter them beyond the Euphrates River,  
because they have made their Asherim, provoking the Lord to anger.

## 1 Kings 14:16

And He will give up Israel on account of the sins of Jeroboam,  
which he committed and with which he misled Israel into sin.”

## 1 Kings 14:17

Then Jeroboam’s wife arose and departed, and came to Tirzah.  
As she was crossing the threshold of the house, the child passed away.

## 1 Kings 14:18

And all Israel buried him and mourned for him,  
in accordance with the word of the Lord, which He had spoken through His servant Ahijah the prophet.

## 1 Kings 14:19

Now regarding the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, his wars and his reign,  
behold, they are recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.

## 1 Kings 14:20

And the duration of Jeroboam's reign was twenty-two years;  
and he rested with his ancestors,  
and his son Nadab succeeded him as king.

---

## 1 Kings 14:21

Now Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, reigned in Judah.  
Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king,  
and he reigned for seventeen years in Jerusalem,  
the city which the Lord had chosen from all the tribes of Israel to place His name there.  
And his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess.

## 1 Kings 14:22

And Judah did evil in the sight of the Lord,  
and they provoked Him to jealousy more than all that their fathers had done,  
with the sins which they committed.

## 1 Kings 14:23

For they also built for themselves high places, memorial stones, and Asherim  
on every high hill and under every luxuriant tree.

## 1 Kings 14:24

There were also male cult prostitutes in the land.  
They committed all the abominations of the nations  
which the Lord dispossessed before the sons of Israel.

## 1 Kings 14:25

In the fifth year of King Rehoboam's reign, Shishak, the king of Egypt, advanced against Jerusalem.

## 1 Kings 14:26

And he took the treasures of the house of the Lord  
and the treasures of the king’s house,  
and he took everything;  
he also took all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.

## 1 Kings 14:27

So King Rehoboam made shields of bronze to replace them,  
and entrusted them to the care of the commanders of the guard  
who protected the entrance to the king’s house.

## 1 Kings 14:28

And it happened that as often as the king entered the house of the Lord,  
the guards would carry them and bring them back into the guards’ room.

---

## 1 Kings 14:29

Now concerning the rest of the acts of Rehoboam and all that he did,  
are they not recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?

## 1 Kings 14:30

And conflict and war persisted between Rehoboam and Jeroboam throughout their reigns.

## 1 Kings 14:31

And Rehoboam rested with his ancestors  
and was buried with them in the city of David.  
And his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonitess.  
And his son Abijam succeeded him as king.
