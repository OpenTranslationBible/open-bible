# 1 Kings Chapter 13

## 1 Kings 13:1

Now behold, a man of God came from Judah to Bethel by the word of the Lord,  
while Jeroboam was standing by the altar to burn incense.

## 1 Kings 13:2

And he cried out against the altar by the word of the Lord, and said,  
“Altar, altar, this is what the Lord says:  
‘Behold, a son shall be born to the house of David,  
Josiah by name;  
and on you he shall sacrifice the priests of the high places who burn incense on you,  
and human bones shall be burned on you.’”

## 1 Kings 13:3

Then he provided a sign that day, saying,  
“This is the sign the Lord has declared:  
Behold, the altar shall be broken apart,  
and the ashes upon it shall be spilled out.”

## 1 Kings 13:4

Now when the king heard the word of the man of God,  
which he cried out against the altar in Bethel,  
Jeroboam stretched out his hand from the altar, saying,  
“Seize him!”  
But his hand which he had stretched out toward him dried up,  
so that he could not draw it back to himself.

## 1 Kings 13:5

The altar also was torn to pieces,  
and the ashes were poured out from the altar,  
according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the Lord.

## 1 Kings 13:6

Then the king responded and said to the man of God,  
“Please appease the Lord your God, and pray for me,  
so that my hand may be restored to me.”  
So the man of God appeased the Lord,  
and the king’s hand was restored to him, and it became as it was before.

## 1 Kings 13:7

Then the king invited the man of God, saying,  
“Come home with me and refresh yourself, and I will give you a gift.”

## 1 Kings 13:8

But the man of God replied to the king,  
“Even if you were to offer me half your possessions,  
I would not go with you,  
nor would I eat bread or drink water in this place.

## 1 Kings 13:9

For I was instructed by the word of the Lord, saying,  
‘You shall not eat bread, nor drink water,  
nor return by the way that you came.’”

## 1 Kings 13:10

So he took a different path  
and did not return by the way that he had come to Bethel.

## 1 Kings 13:11

Now an old prophet was living in Bethel,  
and his sons came and told him all the deeds which the man of God had done that day in Bethel;  
they also told their father the words which he had spoken to the king.

## 1 Kings 13:12

And their father said to them,  
“Which way did he go?”  
Now his sons had seen the way the man of God went,  
who had come from Judah.

## 1 Kings 13:13

Then he said to his sons,  
“Saddle the donkey for me.”  
So they saddled the donkey for him, and he mounted it.

## 1 Kings 13:14

And he pursued the man of God,  
and found him sitting under an oak.  
And he said to him,  
“Are you the man of God who came from Judah?”  
And he replied, “I am.”

## 1 Kings 13:15

Then he invited him,  
“Come home with me and eat bread.”

## 1 Kings 13:16

But he said,  
“I am unable to return with you or accompany you,  
nor will I eat bread or drink water with you in this place.

## 1 Kings 13:17

For I received a command by the word of the Lord:  
‘You shall not eat bread nor drink water there;  
do not return by going the way that you came.’”

## 1 Kings 13:18

But he said to him,  
“I also am a prophet like you,  
and an angel spoke to me by the word of the Lord, saying,  
‘Bring him back with you to your house,  
so that he may eat bread and drink water.’”  
But he lied to him.

## 1 Kings 13:19

Thus, he returned with him, and they shared a meal and drank water in his house.

## 1 Kings 13:20

Now it came about, as they were sitting at the table,  
that the word of the Lord came to the prophet who had brought him back;

## 1 Kings 13:21

and he proclaimed to the man of God who came from Judah, saying,  
“This is what the Lord says:  
‘Because you have disobeyed the Lord's command,  
and have not kept the commandment which the Lord your God instructed you,

## 1 Kings 13:22

but have returned and eaten bread and drunk water in the place  
of which He said to you, “Do not eat bread nor drink water,”  
your dead body shall not come to the grave of your fathers.’”

## 1 Kings 13:23

And it came about after he had eaten bread and after he had drunk,  
that he saddled the donkey for him, for the prophet whom he had brought back.

## 1 Kings 13:24

Now when he had gone,  
a lion met him on the road and killed him,  
and his dead body was thrown on the road,  
with the donkey standing beside it, and the lion was standing beside the dead body.

## 1 Kings 13:25

And behold, men passed by and saw the dead body thrown on the road,  
and the lion standing beside the body;  
so they came and told about it in the city where the old prophet lived.

---

## 1 Kings 13:26

Now when the prophet who had brought him back from the way heard about it,  
he said, “It is the man of God,  
who disobeyed the command of the Lord;  
therefore the Lord has given him to the lion,  
and it has torn him and killed him, according to the word of the Lord which He spoke to him.”

## 1 Kings 13:27

Then he instructed his sons, saying,  
“Saddle the donkey for me.”  
So they saddled it.

## 1 Kings 13:28

And he went and found his dead body thrown on the road,  
with the donkey and the lion standing beside the dead body;  
the lion had not eaten the dead body nor attacked the donkey.

## 1 Kings 13:29

So the prophet picked up the dead body of the man of God,  
and laid it on the donkey, and brought it back;  
and he came to the city of the old prophet, to mourn and to bury him.

## 1 Kings 13:30

And he laid his dead body in his own grave,  
and they mourned over him, saying, “Oh, my brother!”

## 1 Kings 13:31

Now it came about, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying,  
“When I die, bury me in the grave in which the man of God is buried;  
lay my bones beside his bones.

## 1 Kings 13:32

For the word shall certainly come to pass  
which he cried out by the word of the Lord against the altar in Bethel,  
and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria.”

---

## 1 Kings 13:33

After this event, Jeroboam did not turn from his evil way,  
but he again made priests of the high places from among all the people;  
any who wanted, he ordained,  
so they became priests of the high places.

## 1 Kings 13:34

This event also became sin for the house of Jeroboam,  
to wipe it out and eliminate it from the face of the earth.
