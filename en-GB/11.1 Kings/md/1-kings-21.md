# 1 Kings Chapter 21

## 1 Kings 21:1

Now it came to pass after these things that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard in Jezreel, next to the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.

## 1 Kings 21:2

Ahab said to Naboth, “Let me have your vineyard to use as a vegetable garden, because it is near my palace. I will give you a better vineyard in exchange, or if you prefer, I will pay you its value in silver.”

## 1 Kings 21:3

But Naboth said to Ahab, “The Lord forbid that I should give you the inheritance of my ancestors.”

## 1 Kings 21:4

So Ahab went home, sullen and angry because Naboth the Jezreelite had said, “I will not give you the inheritance of my ancestors.”  
He lay on his bed, turned his face away, and refused to eat.

## 1 Kings 21:5

His wife Jezebel came in and asked, “Why are you so upset? Why won’t you eat?”

## 1 Kings 21:6

He replied, “Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and asked him to sell me his vineyard, or to exchange it if he preferred. But he answered, ‘I will not give you my vineyard.’”

## 1 Kings 21:7

Jezebel his wife said, “Is this how you act as king over Israel? Get up and eat something. Cheer up. I will get you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.”

## 1 Kings 21:8

So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name, sealed them with his seal, and sent them to the elders and nobles who lived in Naboth’s city.

## 1 Kings 21:9

In those letters she wrote:  
“Proclaim a fast and seat Naboth in a prominent place among the people.

## 1 Kings 21:10

But seat two scoundrels opposite him and have them testify that he has cursed both God and the king. Then take him out and stone him to death.”

---

## 1 Kings 21:11

So the men of Naboth’s city—the elders and nobles who lived there—did exactly as Jezebel had instructed in the letters she had sent them.

## 1 Kings 21:12

They announced a fast and placed Naboth in a notable position among the people.

## 1 Kings 21:13

Then two worthless men came in and sat opposite him, and testified before the people, saying, “Naboth has cursed God and the king.”  
So they took him outside the city and stoned him to death.

## 1 Kings 21:14

Afterwards, they informed Jezebel, “Naboth has been stoned and is dead.”

---

## 1 Kings 21:15

As soon as Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, she said to Ahab,  
“Get up and take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to sell you. He is no longer alive, but dead.”

## 1 Kings 21:16

When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, he got up and went down to take possession of the vineyard.

## 1 Kings 21:17

The word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite and it was:

## 1 Kings 21:18

“Go to meet Ahab king of Israel, who reigns in Samaria. He is now in Naboth’s vineyard, where he has gone to claim it.

## 1 Kings 21:19

Say to him: ‘This is what the Lord says: Have you murdered and also taken possession?’  
Then say to him, ‘This is what the Lord says: In the place where the dogs licked up Naboth’s blood, dogs will also lick up your blood—yes, yours!’”

## 1 Kings 21:20

Ahab said to Elijah, “So you’ve found me, my enemy!”  
Elijah answered, “I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do evil in the sight of the Lord.

## 1 Kings 21:21

This is what the Lord says:  
‘I will bring disaster upon you. I will wipe out your descendants, and cut off from Ahab every male in Israel—slave or free.

## 1 Kings 21:22

I will make your house like that of Jeroboam son of Nebat and that of Baasha son of Ahijah, because you have provoked My anger and caused Israel to sin.’

## 1 Kings 21:23

And regarding Jezebel, the Lord also says: ‘Dogs will devour Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.’

## 1 Kings 21:24

Dogs will eat anyone belonging to Ahab who dies in the city, and the birds will feed on those who die in the countryside.”

---

## 1 Kings 21:25

There was no one like Ahab, who sold himself to do evil in the sight of the Lord, influenced by Jezebel his wife.

## 1 Kings 21:26

He acted in the most detestable ways by following idols, as the Amorites had done, whom the Lord drove out before Israel.

---

## 1 Kings 21:27

When Ahab heard these words, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and fasted.  
He lay in sackcloth and went about quietly and humbly.

## 1 Kings 21:28

The message of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite:

## 1 Kings 21:29

“Have you noticed how Ahab has humbled himself before Me?  
Because he has humbled himself, I will not bring the disaster in his lifetime.  
I will bring it upon his house in the days of his son.”
