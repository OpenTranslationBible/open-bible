# 1 Kings Chapter 20

## 1 Kings 20:1

Now Ben-hadad, king of Aram, gathered all his army. Thirty-two kings were with him, along with horses and chariots. He marched up and laid siege to Samaria and attacked it.

## 1 Kings 20:2

He sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel, saying,

## 1 Kings 20:3

“This is what Ben-hadad says: ‘Your silver and gold are mine. The best of your wives and children also belong to me.’”

## 1 Kings 20:4

The king of Israel answered, “Just as you say, my lord the king. I and everything I have are yours.”

## 1 Kings 20:5

Then the messengers returned and said, “This is what Ben-hadad says: I sent word to you to give me your silver and gold, your wives and your children.

## 1 Kings 20:6

But now I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time, and they shall search your house and the houses of your officials. Whatever is precious in your eyes, they will take and carry away.”

## 1 Kings 20:7

Then the king of Israel summoned all the elders of the land and said, “Please notice how this man is seeking trouble. He sent for my wives, my children, my silver, and my gold, and I did not refuse him.”

## 1 Kings 20:8

All the elders and the people said to him, “Do not listen to him or give in.”

## 1 Kings 20:9

So he said to Ben-hadad’s messengers, “Tell my lord the king: I will give all that you first demanded of your servant, but this second demand I cannot meet.”  
So the messengers left and reported back.

## 1 Kings 20:10

Then Ben-hadad sent word again, saying,  
“May the gods punish me severely if enough dust remains in Samaria to give a handful to each of the men who follow me!”

## 1 Kings 20:11

But the king of Israel answered,  
“Tell him: Let not the one who puts on his armour boast like the one who takes it off.”

## 1 Kings 20:12

When Ben-hadad heard this reply, he and the other kings were drinking in their tents.  
He ordered his men, “Prepare to attack!”  
So they prepared to assault the city.

## 1 Kings 20:13

Then a prophet came to Ahab king of Israel and said, “This is what the Lord says: Have you seen this vast army? I will deliver it into your hand today, and you shall know that I am the Lord.”

## 1 Kings 20:14

Ahab asked, “By whom?”  
And he said, “This is what the Lord says: By the young officers of the district governors.”  
Then Ahab asked, “Who will begin the battle?”  
And he answered, “You will.”

## 1 Kings 20:15

So Ahab mustered the young officers of the district governors, 232 in total.  
Then he assembled the rest of the army — all the Israelites — numbering seven thousand.

## 1 Kings 20:16

They marched out at noon, while Ben-hadad and the thirty-two kings with him were in their tents getting drunk.

## 1 Kings 20:17

The young officers of the district governors went out first.  
Ben-hadad sent scouts, who reported, “Men are advancing from Samaria.”

## 1 Kings 20:18

He said, “If they have come for peace, take them alive; and if they have come for war, take them alive.”

## 1 Kings 20:19

So the young officers of the district governors advanced from the city, with the army behind them.

## 1 Kings 20:20

Each struck down his opponent, and the Arameans fled.  
Israel pursued them, and Ben-hadad king of Aram escaped on horseback with some of his horsemen.

## 1 Kings 20:21

Then the king of Israel went out and struck down the horses and chariots, and inflicted a great defeat on the Arameans.

## 1 Kings 20:22

Then the prophet came to the king of Israel and said,  
“Go and strengthen yourself. Consider carefully what you must do,  
for in the spring the king of Aram will come back against you.”

## 1 Kings 20:23

Meanwhile the officials of the king of Aram said to him,  
“Their gods are gods of the hills. That is why they were stronger than us.  
But if we fight them in the plains, surely we will be stronger than they.

## 1 Kings 20:24

Do this: remove all the kings from their commands and replace them with commanders.

## 1 Kings 20:25

Also, raise an army like the one you lost — horse for horse and chariot for chariot —  
so we can fight them in the plains. Then surely we will defeat them.”  
He agreed and did as they advised.

## 1 Kings 20:26

When spring arrived, Ben-hadad gathered the Arameans and went up to Aphek to engage Israel in battle.

## 1 Kings 20:27

The Israelites also were mustered and given provisions, and they went out to meet them.  
The people of Israel camped before them like two small flocks of goats, while the Arameans filled the countryside.

## 1 Kings 20:28

Then a man of God came and told the king of Israel,  
“This is what the Lord says: Because the Arameans have said,  
‘The Lord is a god of the hills but not a god of the valleys,’  
I will deliver this vast army into your hands, and you will know that I am the Lord.”

---

## 1 Kings 20:29

They camped opposite each other for seven days.  
On the seventh day, they engaged in battle,  
and the Israelites struck down 100,000 foot soldiers of the Arameans in a single day.

## 1 Kings 20:30

The rest fled into the city of Aphek, where the wall collapsed on 27,000 of them.  
Ben-hadad fled and hid in an inner room within the city.

## 1 Kings 20:31

His officials said to him,  
“Look, we have heard that the kings of Israel are merciful.  
Let us dress in sackcloth with ropes around our heads and go out to the king of Israel.  
Perhaps he will spare your life.”

## 1 Kings 20:32

So they wore sackcloth and ropes, and went to the king of Israel and said,  
“Your servant Ben-hadad says: Please let me live.”  
Ahab replied, “Is he still alive? He is my brother.”

## 1 Kings 20:33

The men took it as a good sign and quickly responded, “Yes, Ben-hadad is your brother.”  
Ahab said, “Go and bring him.”  
So Ben-hadad came out, and Ahab had him come up into the chariot.

## 1 Kings 20:34

Ben-hadad said, “I will return the cities my father took from your father.  
You may set up market areas for yourself in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria.”  
Ahab said, “On the basis of this agreement, I will let you go.”  
So he made a treaty with him and let him go.

## 1 Kings 20:35

Now a certain man from the sons of the prophets said to his neighbour by the word of the Lord,  
“Strike me, please.”  
But the man refused to strike him.

## 1 Kings 20:36

So the prophet said to him,  
“Because you have not obeyed the voice of the Lord,  
as soon as you leave me, a lion will kill you.”  
And as soon as he left, a lion found him and killed him.

## 1 Kings 20:37

Then he found another man and said, “Strike me, please.”  
The man struck him and wounded him.

## 1 Kings 20:38

Then the prophet went and waited for the king by the road,  
disguising himself with a bandage over his eyes.

## 1 Kings 20:39

As the king passed by, he cried out to him,  
“Your servant went into the middle of the battle,  
and someone turned aside and brought a man to me and said,  
‘Guard this man; if he is missing, it will be your life for his life,  
or else you shall pay a talent of silver.’

## 1 Kings 20:40

But while your servant was busy here and there, the man disappeared.”  
And the king of Israel said to him, “That is your judgment. You have decided it yourself.”

## 1 Kings 20:41

Then the prophet quickly removed the bandage from his eyes,  
and the king of Israel recognised him as one of the prophets.

## 1 Kings 20:42

And he said to the king,  
“This is what the Lord says:  
Because you have let go from your hand the man I had devoted to destruction,  
your life shall be for his life, and your people for his people.”

## 1 Kings 20:43

So the king of Israel went back to his house, sullen and angry,  
and came to Samaria.
