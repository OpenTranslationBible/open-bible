# 1 Kings Chapter 11

## 1 Kings 11:1

Now King Solomon loved many foreign women in addition to the daughter of Pharaoh:  
Moabite, Ammonite, Edomite, Sidonian, and Hittite women,

## 1 Kings 11:2

from the nations concerning which the Lord had said to the sons of Israel,  
“You shall not associate with them, nor shall they associate with you;  
they will surely turn your heart away after their gods.”  
Solomon clung to these in love.

## 1 Kings 11:3

He had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines,  
and his wives turned his heart away.

## 1 Kings 11:4

For when Solomon was old,  
his wives turned his heart away after other gods;  
and his heart was not wholly devoted to the Lord his God,  
as the heart of his father David had been.

## 1 Kings 11:5

Solomon followed Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians,  
and Milcom the detestable idol of the Ammonites.

## 1 Kings 11:6

Solomon did what was evil in the sight of the Lord,  
and did not follow the Lord fully,  
as David his father had done.

## 1 Kings 11:7

Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the detestable idol of Moab,  
on the mountain that is east of Jerusalem,  
and for Molech the detestable idol of the sons of Ammon.

## 1 Kings 11:8

He did the same for all his foreign wives,  
who burned incense and sacrificed to their gods.

---

## 1 Kings 11:9

Now the Lord was angry with Solomon  
because his heart had turned away from the Lord, the God of Israel,  
who had appeared to him twice,

## 1 Kings 11:10

and had commanded him about this matter,  
that he was not to follow other gods.  
But he did not comply with what the Lord had commanded.

## 1 Kings 11:11

So the Lord said to Solomon,  
“Since this has been done by you,  
and you have not kept My covenant and My statutes, which I have commanded you,  
I will surely tear the kingdom away from you and give it to your servant.

## 1 Kings 11:12

However, I will not do it in your days for the sake of your father David,  
but I will tear it away from the hand of your son.

## 1 Kings 11:13

Yet I will not tear away all the kingdom,  
but I will give one tribe to your son,  
for the sake of My servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen.”

## 1 Kings 11:14

Then the Lord raised up an adversary against Solomon,  
Hadad the Edomite; he was of the royal line in Edom.

## 1 Kings 11:15

For when David was in Edom, and Joab the commander of the army  
had gone up to bury the slain,  
he struck down every male in Edom.

## 1 Kings 11:16

For Joab and all Israel stayed there for six months,  
until he had eliminated every male in Edom.

## 1 Kings 11:17

But Hadad fled to Egypt,  
he and certain Edomites from his father’s servants with him,  
while Hadad was still a young boy.

## 1 Kings 11:18

They set out from Midian and came to Paran,  
and they took men with them from Paran and came to Egypt,  
to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house, and assigned him food,  
and gave him land.

## 1 Kings 11:19

Now Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh,  
and he gave him as a wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.

## 1 Kings 11:20

The sister of Tahpenes gave birth to his son Genubath,  
whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh’s house,  
and Genubath was in Pharaoh’s household among the sons of Pharaoh.

## 1 Kings 11:21

But when Hadad heard in Egypt that David lay down with his fathers,  
and that Joab the commander of the army was dead,  
Hadad said to Pharaoh, “Send me away, that I may go to my own country.”

## 1 Kings 11:22

Then Pharaoh said to him, “But what have you lacked with me,  
that now you are seeking to go to your own country?”  
And he said, “Nothing; nevertheless, you must surely let me go.”

## 1 Kings 11:23

God also raised up another adversary to him,  
Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah.

## 1 Kings 11:24

He gathered men to himself and became leader of a band,  
when David killed those of Zobah;  
and they went to Damascus and stayed there, and reigned in Damascus.

## 1 Kings 11:25

So he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon,  
along with the evil that Hadad did;  
and he hated Israel and reigned over Aram.

---

## 1 Kings 11:26

Now Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite from Zeredah,  
the servant of Solomon—whose mother’s name was Zeruah, a widow—  
also raised his hand against the king.

## 1 Kings 11:27

Now this was the reason why he raised his hand against the king:  
Solomon built the Millo and closed the gap of the city of his father David.

## 1 Kings 11:28

Now the man Jeroboam was a valiant warrior,  
and when Solomon saw that the young man was industrious,  
he appointed him over all the forced labour of the house of Joseph.

---

## 1 Kings 11:29

Now it came about at that time,  
when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem,  
that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him on the road.  
Now he had covered himself with a new cloak,  
and the two of them were alone in the field.

## 1 Kings 11:30

Then Ahijah took hold of the new cloak which was on him  
and tore it into twelve pieces.

## 1 Kings 11:31

And he said to Jeroboam,  
“Take ten pieces for yourself; for this is what the Lord, the God of Israel says:  
‘Behold, I am going to tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon  
and give you ten tribes.

## 1 Kings 11:32

But he shall have one tribe, for the sake of My servant David  
and for the sake of Jerusalem,  
the city which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel,

## 1 Kings 11:33

because they have abandoned Me,  
and have bowed down to Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians,  
to Chemosh the god of Moab,  
and to Milcom the god of the sons of Ammon,  
and they have not walked in My ways,  
nor done what is right in My sight, nor kept My statutes and My ordinances,  
as his father David did.

## 1 Kings 11:34

Nevertheless, I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand,  
but I will make him ruler all the days of his life,  
for the sake of My servant David whom I chose,  
who kept My commandments and My statutes.

## 1 Kings 11:35

But I will take the kingdom from his son’s hand  
and give it to you—that is, ten tribes.

## 1 Kings 11:36

But to his son I will give one tribe,  
so that My servant David may always have a lamp before Me in Jerusalem,  
the city where I have chosen for Myself to put My name.

## 1 Kings 11:37

However, I will take you, and you shall reign over all that you desire,  
and you shall be king over Israel.

## 1 Kings 11:38

Then it shall be, if you listen to all that I command you  
and walk in My ways, and do what is right in My sight  
by keeping My statutes and My commandments, as My servant David did,  
then I will be with you and build you an enduring house as I built for David,  
and I will give Israel to you.

## 1 Kings 11:39

So I will afflict the descendants of David for this, but not forever.’”

---

## 1 Kings 11:40

Solomon sought to put Jeroboam to death,  
but Jeroboam got up and fled to Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt,  
and he stayed in Egypt until the death of Solomon.

---

## 1 Kings 11:41

Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and whatever he did, and his wisdom,  
are they not written in the Book of the Acts of Solomon?

## 1 Kings 11:42

Thus, Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel for forty years.

## 1 Kings 11:43

Then Solomon lay down with his fathers and was buried in the city of his father David,  
and his son Rehoboam became king in his place.
