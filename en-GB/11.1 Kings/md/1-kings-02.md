# 1 Kings Chapter 2

## 1 Kings 2:1

Now the days of David drew near that he should die,  
and he charged Solomon his son, saying,

## 1 Kings 2:2

“I am going the way of all the earth.  
Be strong, therefore, and prove yourself a man.

## 1 Kings 2:3

Keep the charge of the Lord your God,  
to walk in His ways, to keep His statutes, His commandments, His judgments, and His testimonies,  
as it is written in the Law of Moses,  
so that you may prosper in all that you do and wherever you turn,

## 1 Kings 2:4

so that the Lord may fulfil His word which He spoke concerning me, saying,  
‘If your sons are careful in their way, to walk before Me in truth with all their heart and soul,  
you shall not lack a man to sit on the throne of Israel.’

## 1 Kings 2:5

Moreover, you also know what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me,  
what he did to the two commanders of the armies of Israel,  
to Abner the son of Ner and to Amasa the son of Jether, whom he killed.  
And he shed the blood of war in peacetime,  
and he put the blood of war on his belt that was around his waist and on his sandals that were on his feet.

## 1 Kings 2:6

Therefore act according to your wisdom,  
and do not let his grey hair go down to the grave in peace.

## 1 Kings 2:7

But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite,  
and let them be among those who eat at your table,  
for they came to me when I fled from Absalom your brother.

## 1 Kings 2:8

And behold, you have with you Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite from Bahurim,  
who cursed me with a severe curse on the day I went to Mahanaim.  
But when he came down to meet me at the Jordan,  
I swore to him by the Lord, saying, ‘I will not put you to death with the sword.’

## 1 Kings 2:9

But now do not consider him innocent,  
for you are a wise man and will know what you ought to do to him;  
and you shall bring his grey hair down to the grave with blood.”

---

## 1 Kings 2:10

So David rested with his fathers,  
and was buried in the City of David.

## 1 Kings 2:11

The time that David reigned over Israel was forty years.  
He reigned seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.

## 1 Kings 2:12

Then Solomon sat on the throne of his father David,  
and his kingdom was firmly established.

---

## 1 Kings 2:13

Now Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon,  
and she said, “Do you come peaceably?”  
And he said, “Peaceably.”

## 1 Kings 2:14

Then he said, “I have something to say to you.”  
So she said, “Speak.”

## 1 Kings 2:15

And he said,  
“You know that the kingdom was mine,  
and that all Israel expected me to reign.  
However, the kingdom has turned around and become my brother’s,  
for it was his from the Lord.

## 1 Kings 2:16

Now I ask one petition of you; do not refuse me.”  
And she said to him, “Speak.”

## 1 Kings 2:17

Then he said,  
“Please speak to King Solomon—he will not refuse you—  
that he may give me Abishag the Shunammite as a wife.”

## 1 Kings 2:18

So Bathsheba said, “Very well; I will speak to the king for you.”

---

## 1 Kings 2:19

So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah.  
And the king rose to meet her and bowed down to her,  
and sat down on his throne  
and had a throne set for the king’s mother,  
and she sat at his right hand.

## 1 Kings 2:20

Then she said, “I am making one small request of you; do not refuse me.”  
And the king said to her, “Ask, my mother, for I will not refuse you.”

## 1 Kings 2:21

So she said, “Allow Abishag the Shunammite to be given to Adonijah your brother as his wife.”

## 1 Kings 2:22

King Solomon answered and said to his mother,  
“Why are you asking Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah?  
Ask for him the kingdom as well—since he is my older brother—  
even for him, for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah!”

## 1 Kings 2:23

Then King Solomon swore by the Lord, saying,  
“May God do so to me, and more also,  
if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his own life.

## 1 Kings 2:24

Now therefore, as the Lord lives, who has established me  
and set me on the throne of David my father,  
and who has made me a house as He promised—  
surely Adonijah shall be put to death today.”

## 1 Kings 2:25

So King Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada,  
and he struck him down and he died.

---

## 1 Kings 2:26

Then the king said to Abiathar the priest,  
“Go to Anathoth, to your own fields,  
for you deserve to die;  
but I will not put you to death at this time,  
because you carried the ark of the Lord God before my father David,  
and because you were afflicted in everything in which my father was afflicted.”

## 1 Kings 2:27

So Solomon removed Abiathar from being priest to the Lord,  
to fulfil the word of the Lord which He had spoken  
concerning the house of Eli at Shiloh.

---

## 1 Kings 2:28

Now the news came to Joab,  
for Joab had followed Adonijah,  
though he had not followed Absalom.  
So Joab fled to the tent of the Lord and took hold of the horns of the altar.

## 1 Kings 2:29

And it was told King Solomon that Joab had fled to the tent of the Lord,  
and behold, he was by the altar.  
Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying,  
“Go, strike him down.”

## 1 Kings 2:30

So Benaiah came to the tent of the Lord and said to him,  
“Thus says the king, ‘Come out!’”  
But he said, “No, for I will die here.”  
So Benaiah brought word again to the king, saying,  
“This is what Joab said, and this is how he answered me.”

## 1 Kings 2:31

Then the king said to him,  
“Do as he has said, and strike him down and bury him,  
so that you may remove from me and from my father’s house  
the guilt of the blood which Joab shed without cause.

## 1 Kings 2:32

And the Lord will return his blood on his own head,  
because he struck down two men more righteous and better than he,  
and killed them with the sword: Abner the son of Ner,  
commander of the army of Israel,  
and Amasa the son of Jether, commander of the army of Judah,  
though my father David did not know it.

## 1 Kings 2:33

So their blood shall return on the head of Joab and on the head of his descendants forever.  
But to David and his descendants and his house and his throne  
there shall be peace from the Lord forever.”

## 1 Kings 2:34

Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and struck Joab and killed him,  
and he was buried at his own house in the wilderness.

---

## 1 Kings 2:35

The king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada over the army in his place,  
and the king appointed Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar.

---

## 1 Kings 2:36

Then the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him,  
“Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there,  
and do not go out from there to any other place.

## 1 Kings 2:37

For on the day you go out and cross the Brook Kidron,  
you shall know for certain that you will surely die;  
your blood shall be on your own head.”

## 1 Kings 2:38

Shimei said to the king,  
“The word is good. As my lord the king has said, so your servant will do.”  
So Shimei lived in Jerusalem for many days.

## 1 Kings 2:39

But it came about at the end of three years,  
that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish son of Maacah, king of Gath.  
And they told Shimei, saying, “Behold, your servants are in Gath.”

## 1 Kings 2:40

So Shimei arose and saddled his donkey,  
and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants,  
and Shimei went and brought his servants from Gath.

## 1 Kings 2:41

And Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had returned.

## 1 Kings 2:42

So the king sent and called for Shimei and said to him,  
“Did I not make you swear by the Lord and solemnly warn you, saying,  
‘Know for certain that on the day you depart and go anywhere,  
you shall surely die’?  
And you said to me, ‘The word I have heard is good.’

## 1 Kings 2:43

Why then have you not kept the oath of the Lord  
and the command that I gave you?”

## 1 Kings 2:44

The king also said to Shimei,  
“You know in your heart all the evil that you did to my father David;  
therefore the Lord shall return your evil on your own head.

## 1 Kings 2:45

But King Solomon shall be blessed,  
and the throne of David shall be established before the Lord forever.”

## 1 Kings 2:46

So the king gave command to Benaiah the son of Jehoiada,  
and he went out and struck him down and he died.  
Thus the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.
