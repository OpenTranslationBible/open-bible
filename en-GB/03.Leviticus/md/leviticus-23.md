# Leviticus Chapter 23

## Leviticus 23:1
The Lord said to Moses,

## Leviticus 23:2
“Speak to the Israelites and say: These are My appointed festivals, the sacred assemblies you are to proclaim at their appointed times.

## Leviticus 23:3
There are six days when you may work, but the seventh day is a sabbath of rest, a day of sacred assembly.

## Leviticus 23:4
These are the Lord’s appointed festivals, the sacred assemblies you are to proclaim at their appointed times:

## Leviticus 23:5
The Passover begins at twilight on the fourteenth day of the first month.

## Leviticus 23:6
The Festival of Unleavened Bread starts on the fifteenth day and lasts seven days; eat bread made without yeast.

## Leviticus 23:7
Hold a sacred assembly on the first day and do no regular work.

## Leviticus 23:8
For seven days present food offerings to the Lord. On the seventh day, hold another sacred assembly and do no work.

## Leviticus 23:9
The Lord said to Moses,

## Leviticus 23:10
“When you enter the land I am giving you and reap its harvest, bring the first sheaf of your harvest to the priest.

## Leviticus 23:11
He is to wave the sheaf before the Lord so it may be accepted. Do this the day after the Sabbath.

## Leviticus 23:12
On that day, sacrifice a year-old male lamb without defect as a burnt offering.

## Leviticus 23:13
With it present a grain offering and a drink offering.

## Leviticus 23:14
Do not eat any bread or new grain until this offering is presented.

## Leviticus 23:15
From the day after the Sabbath, count seven full weeks.

## Leviticus 23:16
On the fiftieth day, present a new grain offering to the Lord.

## Leviticus 23:17
Bring two loaves made with yeast as a wave offering.

## Leviticus 23:18
Present with them seven male lambs, one young bull and two rams—all without defect.

## Leviticus 23:19
Then sacrifice one male goat for a sin offering and two lambs for a fellowship offering.

## Leviticus 23:20
The priest is to wave them before the Lord. They are sacred and belong to the priest.

## Leviticus 23:21
On that same day, hold a sacred assembly and do no work. This is to be a lasting ordinance.

## Leviticus 23:22
When you reap the harvest, do not reap to the edges or gather the gleanings. Leave them for the poor and foreigner.

## Leviticus 23:23
The Lord said to Moses,

## Leviticus 23:24
“On the first day of the seventh month, have a day of sabbath rest, a sacred assembly commemorated with trumpet blasts.

## Leviticus 23:25
Do no regular work and present a food offering.

## Leviticus 23:26
The Lord said to Moses,

## Leviticus 23:27
“The tenth day of the seventh month is the Day of Atonement. Hold a sacred assembly and deny yourselves.

## Leviticus 23:28
Do not do any work, for it is a day of atonement.

## Leviticus 23:29
Anyone who does not deny themselves must be cut off.

## Leviticus 23:30
I will destroy anyone who does any work on that day.

## Leviticus 23:31
You shall do no work at all. This is to be a lasting ordinance.

## Leviticus 23:32
It is a day of sabbath rest. Begin the evening before and observe it until the following evening.

## Leviticus 23:33
The Lord said to Moses,

## Leviticus 23:34
“On the fifteenth day of the seventh month begins the Festival of Tabernacles. It lasts seven days.

## Leviticus 23:35
On the first day, hold a sacred assembly and do no regular work.

## Leviticus 23:36
For seven days present food offerings. On the eighth day, hold another assembly and present an offering.

## Leviticus 23:37
These are the Lord’s appointed festivals, which you are to proclaim as sacred assemblies.

## Leviticus 23:38
These offerings are in addition to your regular sabbaths, gifts and vows.

## Leviticus 23:39
On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, after the harvest, celebrate a festival to the Lord for seven days.

## Leviticus 23:40
Take branches from trees—palm, leafy, and poplars—and rejoice before the Lord.

## Leviticus 23:41
Celebrate this festival annually. It is a lasting ordinance for all generations.

## Leviticus 23:42
Live in temporary shelters for seven days.

## Leviticus 23:43
This reminds you that I made the Israelites live in booths when I brought them out of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.

## Leviticus 23:44
So Moses announced to the Israelites the appointed festivals of the Lord.
