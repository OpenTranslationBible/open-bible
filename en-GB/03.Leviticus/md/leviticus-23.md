# Leviticus Chapter 23

## Leviticus 23:1
The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,

## Leviticus 23:2
“Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘These are the Lord’s appointed times, which you shall proclaim as holy assemblies—My appointed festivals are these:

## Leviticus 23:3
For six days work may be done, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of complete rest, a holy assembly. You shall not do any work; it is a Sabbath to the Lord in all your dwellings.

## Leviticus 23:4
These are the Lord’s appointed times, holy assemblies, which you shall proclaim at the times appointed for them:

## Leviticus 23:5
In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at twilight, is the Lord’s Passover.

## Leviticus 23:6
On the fifteenth day of the same month is the Festival of Unleavened Bread to the Lord; for seven days you shall eat bread made without yeast.

## Leviticus 23:7
On the first day hold a holy assembly; you shall not do any regular work.

## Leviticus 23:8
For seven days present an offering by fire to the Lord. On the seventh day hold a holy assembly; you shall not do any regular work.’”

## Leviticus 23:9
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,

## Leviticus 23:10
“Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘When you enter the land which I am going to give you and you reap its harvest, bring to the priest a sheaf of the first grain you harvest.

## Leviticus 23:11
He shall wave the sheaf before the Lord so it may be accepted on your behalf; the priest is to wave it on the day after the Sabbath.

## Leviticus 23:12
On the day you wave the sheaf, you shall offer a male lamb a year old without defect as a burnt offering to the Lord,

## Leviticus 23:13
together with its grain offering of two-tenths of an ephah of the finest flour mixed with oil, an offering by fire to the Lord, a pleasing aroma, and its drink offering of a quarter of a hin of wine.

## Leviticus 23:14
You shall not eat any bread, or roasted or new grain, until the very day you bring this offering to your God. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come, wherever you live.

## Leviticus 23:15
From the day after the Sabbath, the day you brought the sheaf of the wave offering, you shall count off seven full weeks.

## Leviticus 23:16
Count off fifty days up to the day after the seventh Sabbath, and then present an offering of new grain to the Lord.

## Leviticus 23:17
From wherever you live, bring two loaves made of two-tenths of an ephah of the finest flour, baked with yeast, as a wave offering of firstfruits to the Lord.

## Leviticus 23:18
With this bread, present seven male lambs, each a year old and without defect, one young bull and two rams. They shall be a burnt offering to the Lord, with their grain offerings and drink offerings, an offering by fire, a pleasing aroma to the Lord.

## Leviticus 23:19
Then sacrifice one male goat for a sin offering and two lambs, each a year old, as a fellowship offering.

## Leviticus 23:20
The priest shall wave the two lambs before the Lord as a wave offering, together with the bread of the firstfruits. They are a sacred offering to the Lord for the priest.

## Leviticus 23:21
On that same day you shall proclaim a holy assembly and do no regular work. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come, wherever you live.

## Leviticus 23:22
When you reap the harvest of your land, do not reap to the very edges of your field or gather the gleanings of your harvest. Leave them for the poor and the foreigner residing among you. I am the Lord your God.’”

## Leviticus 23:23
The Lord spoke to Moses again, saying,

## Leviticus 23:24
“Speak to the Israelites, saying, ‘On the first day of the seventh month you shall have a day of rest, a memorial proclaimed with trumpet blasts, a holy assembly.

## Leviticus 23:25
You shall not do any regular work, but you shall present an offering by fire to the Lord.’”

## Leviticus 23:26
The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,

## Leviticus 23:27
“On the tenth day of this seventh month is the Day of Atonement. Hold a holy assembly and humble yourselves, and present an offering by fire to the Lord.

## Leviticus 23:28
You shall not do any work on that day, for it is the Day of Atonement, to make atonement for you before the Lord your God.

## Leviticus 23:29
Anyone who does not humble himself on that day must be cut off from his people.

## Leviticus 23:30
I will destroy from among his people anyone who does any work on that day.

## Leviticus 23:31
You shall do no work at all. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come, wherever you live.

## Leviticus 23:32
It is a Sabbath of complete rest for you, and you must humble yourselves. From the evening of the ninth day of the month until the following evening you shall observe your Sabbath.”

## Leviticus 23:33
The Lord spoke to Moses again, saying,

## Leviticus 23:34
“Speak to the Israelites, saying, ‘On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the Festival of Tabernacles for seven days to the Lord.

## Leviticus 23:35
On the first day is a holy assembly; you shall not do any regular work.

## Leviticus 23:36
For seven days you shall present an offering by fire to the Lord, and on the eighth day hold a holy assembly and present an offering by fire to the Lord. It is a closing special assembly; you shall not do any regular work.

## Leviticus 23:37
These are the Lord’s appointed festivals, which you shall proclaim as holy assemblies for bringing offerings by fire to the Lord—burnt offerings and grain offerings, sacrifices and drink offerings, each day’s requirement on its own day—

## Leviticus 23:38
besides those of the Sabbaths of the Lord, and besides your gifts and all your vowed and voluntary offerings, which you give to the Lord.

## Leviticus 23:39
On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the crops of the land, you shall celebrate the festival to the Lord for seven days; the first day is a day of rest, and the eighth day also is a day of rest.

## Leviticus 23:40
On the first day you shall take branches from luxuriant trees, from palms, willows and other leafy trees, and rejoice before the Lord your God for seven days.

## Leviticus 23:41
Celebrate it as a festival to the Lord for seven days each year. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come; celebrate it in the seventh month.

## Leviticus 23:42
Live in temporary shelters for seven days; all native-born Israelites shall live in such shelters,

## Leviticus 23:43
so that your descendants may know that I had the Israelites live in temporary shelters when I brought them out of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.’”

## Leviticus 23:44
So Moses declared to the Israelites the appointed festivals of the Lord.
