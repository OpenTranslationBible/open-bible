# Leviticus Chapter 19

## Leviticus 19:1

The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

## Leviticus 19:2

“Speak to the whole assembly of the children of Israel and tell them: ‘You shall be holy, for I, the Lord your God, am holy.

## Leviticus 19:3

Each of you shall respect his mother and father, and you shall observe my Sabbaths. I am the Lord your God.

## Leviticus 19:4

Do not turn to idols or make for yourselves gods of cast metal. I am the Lord your God.

## Leviticus 19:5

When you offer a sacrifice of fellowship offerings to the Lord, you must offer it in such a way that it will be accepted on your behalf.

## Leviticus 19:6

It shall be eaten on the day you offer it, or on the next day; anything left over until the third day must be burned with fire.

## Leviticus 19:7

If any of it is consumed on the third day, it is considered impure and will not be accepted.

## Leviticus 19:8

Anyone who eats it will bear the consequences of his guilt, for he has profaned what is holy to the Lord; that person shall be cut off from his people.

## Leviticus 19:9

When you gather the harvest of your land, do not harvest to the very edges of your field or collect the gleanings of your harvest.

## Leviticus 19:10

Do not go over your vineyard again or gather the fallen grapes. Leave them for the poor and the foreigner. I am the Lord your God.

## Leviticus 19:11

You shall not steal, nor lie, nor deceive one another.

## Leviticus 19:12

You shall not swear falsely by my name, thereby profaning the name of your God. I am the Lord.

Do not cheat or rob your neighbour. Do not withhold the wages of a hired worker overnight.

## Leviticus 19:14

Do not curse the deaf or put a stumbling block before the blind, but fear your God. I am the Lord.

## Leviticus 19:15

Do not distort justice; do not show partiality to the poor or favouritism to the great, but judge your neighbour fairly.

## Leviticus 19:16

Do not spread harmful rumours among your people. Do not act in a way that endangers your neighbour’s life. I am the Lord.

## Leviticus 19:17

Do not hate your fellow countryman in your heart. Rebuke your neighbour frankly so you will not share in his guilt.

## Leviticus 19:18

Do not seek revenge or hold a grudge against anyone among your people, but love your neighbour as yourself. I am the Lord.

## Leviticus 19:19

Keep my decrees. Do not breed different kinds of animals. Do not plant your field with two kinds of seed. Do not wear clothing woven of two kinds of material.

## Leviticus 19:20

If a man has sexual relations with a woman who is a slave and promised to another man, but who has not been redeemed or given her freedom, there must be due punishment. They shall not be put to death, because she was not free.

## Leviticus 19:21

The man must bring a ram to the entrance of the tent of meeting for a guilt offering to the Lord.

## Leviticus 19:22

With the ram of the guilt offering, the priest shall make atonement for him before the Lord for the sin he has committed, and his sin will be forgiven.

## Leviticus 19:23

When you enter the land and plant any kind of fruit tree, regard its fruit as forbidden. For three years it will be forbidden to you; it must not be eaten.

## Leviticus 19:24

In the fourth year all its fruit shall be holy, an offering of praise to the Lord.

## Leviticus 19:25

But in the fifth year you may eat its fruit, so that its yield may increase for you. I am the Lord your God.

## Leviticus 19:26

You shall not eat any meat with the blood still in it. You shall not practise divination or seek omens.

## Leviticus 19:27

Do not trim the hair at the sides of your head or clip off the edges of your beard.

## Leviticus 19:28

Do not mark your bodies for the dead or put tattoo marks on yourselves. I am the Lord.

## Leviticus 19:29

Do not dishonour your daughter by making her a prostitute, or the land will turn to prostitution and be filled with wickedness.

## Leviticus 19:30

Observe my Sabbaths and show reverence for my sanctuary. I am the Lord.

## Leviticus 19:31

Do not turn to mediums or seek out spiritists, for you will be defiled by them. I am the Lord your God.

## Leviticus 19:32

Rise in the presence of the aged, show respect for the elderly and revere your God. I am the Lord.

## Leviticus 19:33

When a foreigner resides among you in your land, do not mistreat him.

## Leviticus 19:34

The foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native-born. Love him as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt. I am the Lord your God.

## Leviticus 19:35

Do not use dishonest measures when determining length, weight or quantity.

## Leviticus 19:36

Use accurate scales and honest weights, an honest ephah and an honest hin. I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt.

## Leviticus 19:37

Observe all my decrees and all my laws and follow them. I am the Lord.’”
