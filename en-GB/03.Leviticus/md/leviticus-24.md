# Leviticus Chapter 24

## Leviticus 24:1

The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying,

## Leviticus 24:2

“Command the Israelites to bring you clear oil from pressed olives for the light, so that the lamps may burn continually.

## Leviticus 24:3

Outside the curtain of the testimony in the tent of meeting, Aaron shall tend the lamps before the Lord from evening until morning, continually. This shall be a lasting ordinance for all generations.

## Leviticus 24:4

The lamps on the pure gold lampstand before the Lord must be kept in order continually.

## Leviticus 24:5

“Take fine flour and bake twelve loaves with it, using two-tenths of an ephah for each loaf.

## Leviticus 24:6

Arrange them in two rows, six in each row, on the table of pure gold before the Lord.

## Leviticus 24:7

Place pure incense on each row, as a memorial portion to represent the bread, an offering by fire to the Lord.

## Leviticus 24:8

This bread is to be set out before the Lord regularly, every Sabbath, as an everlasting covenant for the Israelites.

## Leviticus 24:9

It shall belong to Aaron and his sons, who are to eat it in a holy place, for it is a most holy part of their perpetual share of the offerings by fire to the Lord.”

## Leviticus 24:10

Now the son of an Israelite woman and an Egyptian father went out among the Israelites, and a fight broke out in the camp between him and an Israelite man.

## Leviticus 24:11

The son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name and cursed. So they brought him to Moses. (His mother’s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.)

## Leviticus 24:12

They held him in custody until they could discern the Lord's will regarding him.

## Leviticus 24:13

The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying,

## Leviticus 24:14

“Bring the blasphemer outside the camp. All those who heard him are to lay their hands on his head, and the entire assembly is to stone him.

## Leviticus 24:15

Say to the Israelites: ‘Anyone who curses their God will bear the responsibility for their sin;

## Leviticus 24:16

anyone who blasphemes the name of the Lord must be put to death. The entire assembly shall stone them. Whether foreigner or native-born, when they blaspheme the Name they shall be put to death.

## Leviticus 24:17

“‘Anyone who takes a human life must be put to death.

## Leviticus 24:18

Anyone who takes the life of an animal must make restitution, life for life.

## Leviticus 24:19

If anyone injures their neighbour, the same shall be done to them:

## Leviticus 24:20

fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. Just as they have injured another, so shall it be inflicted on them.

## Leviticus 24:21

Whoever kills an animal must make restitution, but whoever kills a human being must be put to death.

## Leviticus 24:22

You shall have the same law for the foreigner and the native-born. I am the Lord your God.’”

## Leviticus 24:23

Then Moses spoke to the Israelites, and they took the blasphemer outside the camp and stoned him. The Israelites did just as the Lord commanded Moses.
