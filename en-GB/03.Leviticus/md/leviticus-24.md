# Leviticus Chapter 24

## Leviticus 24:1
The Lord said to Moses,

## Leviticus 24:2
“Command the Israelites to bring you clear oil from pressed olives for the lamps, so they can be kept burning continually.

## Leviticus 24:3
Aaron is to keep the lamps burning continually from evening till morning before the Lord, outside the curtain of the covenant law in the tent of meeting. This is to be a lasting ordinance for the generations to come.

## Leviticus 24:4
The lamps on the pure gold lampstand before the Lord must be tended continually.

## Leviticus 24:5
Take the finest flour and bake twelve loaves of bread, using two-tenths of an ephah for each loaf.

## Leviticus 24:6
Arrange them in two stacks, six in each stack, on the table of pure gold before the Lord.

## Leviticus 24:7
Put pure incense along each stack to serve as a memorial portion and food offering to the Lord.

## Leviticus 24:8
Every Sabbath, Aaron is to arrange them before the Lord regularly, as a lasting covenant. This is for the Israelites.

## Leviticus 24:9
The bread belongs to Aaron and his sons. They are to eat it in the sanctuary area, because it is a most holy part of their perpetual share of food offerings.

## Leviticus 24:10
Now a man who was the son of an Israelite mother and an Egyptian father went out among the Israelites, and a fight broke out in the camp between him and a full Israelite.

## Leviticus 24:11
The son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name with a curse; so they brought him to Moses. (His mother’s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.)

## Leviticus 24:12
They put him in custody until the Lord’s will could be made clear to them.

## Leviticus 24:13
Then the Lord said to Moses:

## Leviticus 24:14
“Take the blasphemer outside the camp. All those who heard him are to lay their hands on his head, and the entire assembly is to stone him.

## Leviticus 24:15
Say to the Israelites: Anyone who curses their God will be held responsible.

## Leviticus 24:16
Anyone who blasphemes the name of the Lord is to be put to death. The whole assembly must stone them—whether foreigner or native-born—when they blaspheme the Name.

## Leviticus 24:17
Anyone who takes the life of a human being is to be put to death.

## Leviticus 24:18
Anyone who takes the life of an animal must make restitution—life for life.

## Leviticus 24:19
Anyone who injures their neighbour is to be injured in the same manner:

## Leviticus 24:20
Fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. The one who has inflicted the injury must suffer the same injury.

## Leviticus 24:21
Whoever kills an animal must make restitution, but whoever kills a human being is to be put to death.

## Leviticus 24:22
You are to have the same law for the foreigner and the native-born. I am the Lord your God.

## Leviticus 24:23
Then Moses spoke to the Israelites, and they took the blasphemer outside the camp and stoned him. The Israelites did as the Lord commanded Moses.
