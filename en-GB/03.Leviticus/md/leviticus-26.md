# Leviticus Chapter 26

## Leviticus 26:1
Do not make idols or set up an image or sacred stone for yourselves. Do not place a carved stone in your land to bow down to it. I am the Lord your God.

## Leviticus 26:2
Observe My Sabbaths and have reverence for My sanctuary. I am the Lord.

## Leviticus 26:3
If you follow My statutes and carefully obey My commands,

## Leviticus 26:4
I will send rain in its season, and the land will yield its crops and the trees their fruit.

## Leviticus 26:5
Your threshing will continue until grape harvest and the grape harvest will continue until planting. You will eat your fill and live securely in your land.

## Leviticus 26:6
I will grant peace in the land, and you will lie down without fear. I will remove wild beasts, and the sword will not pass through your land.

## Leviticus 26:7
You will pursue your enemies, and they will fall by the sword before you.

## Leviticus 26:8
Five of you will chase a hundred, and a hundred of you will chase ten thousand, and your enemies will fall.

## Leviticus 26:9
I will look on you with favour and make you fruitful and increase your numbers, and I will keep My covenant with you.

## Leviticus 26:10
You will still be eating last year’s harvest when you will have to move it out to make room for the new.

## Leviticus 26:11
I will set My dwelling place among you, and I will not reject you.

## Leviticus 26:12
I will walk among you and be your God, and you will be My people.

## Leviticus 26:13
I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt so you would no longer be slaves. I broke the bars of your yoke and enabled you to walk upright.

## Leviticus 26:14
But if you do not listen to Me or carry out all these commands,

## Leviticus 26:15
and if you reject My statutes and despise My regulations,

## Leviticus 26:16
then I will bring sudden terror on you—wasting diseases and fever that will destroy your sight and sap your strength. You will plant seed in vain because your enemies will eat it.

## Leviticus 26:17
I will turn My face against you, and you will be defeated by your enemies.

## Leviticus 26:18
If you still do not listen, I will punish you seven times over for your sins.

## Leviticus 26:19
I will break your pride in power. I will make your heavens like iron and your ground like bronze.

## Leviticus 26:20
Your strength will be spent in vain; your land will not yield its crops.

## Leviticus 26:21
If you remain hostile and refuse to listen, I will multiply your afflictions seven times over.

## Leviticus 26:22
I will send wild animals to rob you of your children and destroy your livestock.

## Leviticus 26:23
If you still do not accept My discipline,

## Leviticus 26:24
I will afflict you with a plague and deliver you into enemy hands.

## Leviticus 26:25
I will bring the sword and you will be gathered into cities under siege. I will cut off your supply of bread.

## Leviticus 26:26
Ten women will bake bread in one oven and ration it by weight.

## Leviticus 26:27
If despite this you still do not listen,

## Leviticus 26:28
I will punish you for your sins seven times over.

## Leviticus 26:29
You will eat the flesh of your sons and daughters.

## Leviticus 26:30
I will destroy your high places and cut down your incense altars.

## Leviticus 26:31
I will lay your cities waste and desolate your sanctuaries.

## Leviticus 26:32
I will bring the land into desolation, and your enemies who live there will be appalled.

## Leviticus 26:33
I will scatter you among the nations and draw out My sword against you.

## Leviticus 26:34
Then the land will enjoy its Sabbaths all the time it lies desolate.

## Leviticus 26:35
As long as it lies desolate, it will rest.

## Leviticus 26:36
I will make the hearts of those left in the lands of their enemies so fearful that the sound of a wind-blown leaf will put them to flight.

## Leviticus 26:37
They will stumble as if fleeing from the sword, even though no one is pursuing them.

## Leviticus 26:38
You will perish among the nations.

## Leviticus 26:39
Those of you who survive will waste away because of their sins and the sins of their ancestors.

## Leviticus 26:40
But if they will confess their sins and the sins of their ancestors—their unfaithfulness and hostility toward Me—

## Leviticus 26:41
which made Me hostile toward them and caused Me to drive them into the land of their enemies—then when their hearts are humbled and they make amends,

## Leviticus 26:42
I will remember My covenant with Jacob, Isaac, and Abraham, and I will remember the land.

## Leviticus 26:43
The land will be left empty and will enjoy its rest.

## Leviticus 26:44
Yet in spite of this, I will not reject or abhor them so as to destroy them or break My covenant.

## Leviticus 26:45
For their sake, I will remember the covenant with their ancestors, whom I brought out of Egypt.

## Leviticus 26:46
These are the statutes, laws, and regulations the Lord established on Mount Sinai between Himself and the Israelites through Moses.
