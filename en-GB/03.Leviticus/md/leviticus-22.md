# Leviticus Chapter 22

## Leviticus 22:1

The Lord then spoke to Moses and said,

## Leviticus 22:2

“Tell Aaron and his sons to handle with care the sacred offerings the Israelites dedicate to Me, so that they do not profane My holy name. I am the Lord.

## Leviticus 22:3

“Say to them: ‘Throughout your generations, if any of your descendants approaches the holy gifts dedicated to the Lord while being ceremonially unclean, that person shall be cut off from My presence. I am the Lord.

## Leviticus 22:4

‘No descendant of Aaron who has a defiling skin disease or a discharge may eat the sacred offerings until he is clean. He will also be unclean if he touches anything made unclean by a corpse or a man who has a seminal emission,

## Leviticus 22:5

or if he touches any swarming creature that makes him unclean, or any person by whom he is made unclean, whatever his uncleanness may be.

## Leviticus 22:6

The person who touches any such thing shall be unclean until evening and must not eat any of the sacred offerings unless he has bathed his body in water.

## Leviticus 22:7

When the sun sets, he will be clean, and afterward he may eat of the sacred offerings, for it is his food.

## Leviticus 22:8

He must not eat anything that dies naturally or is torn by wild animals, becoming unclean by it. I am the Lord.

## Leviticus 22:9

“They must carry out their duties to Me in such a way that they do not incur guilt and die because of it, for they profane it. I am the Lord who makes them holy.

## Leviticus 22:10

‘No outsider may eat the sacred offering; a foreigner residing with the priest or a hired worker shall not eat it.

## Leviticus 22:11

But if a priest buys a slave with his money, that person may eat of it, and those born in his household may eat of his food.

## Leviticus 22:12

If a priest’s daughter marries a layman, she may not eat of the sacred contributions.

## Leviticus 22:13

But if a priest’s daughter becomes a widow or is divorced and has no children, and she returns to her father’s house as in her youth, she may eat of her father’s food; but no outsider shall eat of it.

## Leviticus 22:14

If anyone eats a sacred offering unintentionally, they must make restitution to the priest for the offering and add a fifth of its value to it.

## Leviticus 22:15

The priests must ensure that the sacred offerings presented by the Israelites to the Lord are treated with respect

## Leviticus 22:16

by allowing them to eat the sacred offerings and thereby bring upon them guilt requiring restitution. I am the Lord who makes them holy.’”

## Leviticus 22:17

The Lord addressed Moses,

## Leviticus 22:18

“Speak to Aaron, his sons, and all the Israelites and say to them: ‘If any of you—whether an Israelite or a foreigner residing in Israel—presents a gift as a burnt offering to the Lord, to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering,

## Leviticus 22:19

it must be a male without defect from the cattle, sheep, or goats in order that it may be accepted on your behalf.

## Leviticus 22:20

Do not present anything with a defect, for it will not be accepted on your behalf.

## Leviticus 22:21

When anyone brings a fellowship offering to the Lord to fulfill a special vow or as a freewill offering from the herd or flock, it must be without defect or blemish to be acceptable.

## Leviticus 22:22

Do not offer to the Lord anything that is blind, injured, or maimed, or with warts, festering, or running sores. Do not place any of these on the altar as a food offering presented to the Lord.

## Leviticus 22:23

You may, however, present an ox or a sheep that is deformed or stunted as a freewill offering, but it will not be accepted in fulfillment of a vow.

## Leviticus 22:24

Do not offer to the Lord an animal whose testicles are bruised, crushed, torn, or cut. Do not do this in your land,

## Leviticus 22:25

and do not accept such animals from a foreigner to offer as the food of your God. They will not be accepted on your behalf, for they are deformed and have defects.’”

## Leviticus 22:26

The Lord addressed Moses,

## Leviticus 22:27

“When a calf, lamb, or goat is born, it is to remain with its mother for seven days. From the eighth day on, it will be acceptable as a food offering presented to the Lord.

## Leviticus 22:28

Refrain from slaughtering a cow or a sheep along with its young on the same day.

## Leviticus 22:29

“When you offer a thank offering to the Lord, do so in a manner that ensures it will be accepted on your behalf.

## Leviticus 22:30

It must be eaten on the same day; do not leave any of it till morning. I am the Lord.

## Leviticus 22:31

“Keep My commandments and follow them. I am the Lord.

## Leviticus 22:32

Do not profane My holy name, for I must be acknowledged as holy by the Israelites. I am the Lord who makes you holy,

## Leviticus 22:33

and who delivered you from Egypt to be your God. I am the Lord.”
