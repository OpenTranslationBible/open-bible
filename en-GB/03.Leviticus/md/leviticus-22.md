# Leviticus Chapter 22

## Leviticus 22:1
The Lord said to Moses,

## Leviticus 22:2
“Tell Aaron and his sons to treat with respect the sacred offerings the Israelites consecrate to Me, so they do not profane My holy name. I am the Lord.

## Leviticus 22:3
Say to them: If any of your descendants touches a sacred offering while ceremonially unclean, he must be cut off from My presence.

## Leviticus 22:4
If a descendant of Aaron has a skin disease or a bodily discharge, he may not eat the sacred offerings until he is clean.

## Leviticus 22:5
Anyone who touches something defiled by a corpse or an unclean person,

## Leviticus 22:6
or who touches any crawling thing or unclean person, becomes unclean until evening and may not eat the sacred offerings unless they wash with water.

## Leviticus 22:7
When the sun sets, they will be clean, and they may eat the sacred offerings, for they are their food.

## Leviticus 22:8
They must not eat anything found dead or torn by wild animals, or they will be unclean.

## Leviticus 22:9
The priests must keep My instructions or they will bear guilt and die for profaning it. I am the Lord who makes them holy.

## Leviticus 22:10
No one outside a priest’s family may eat the sacred offering, including guests or hired workers.

## Leviticus 22:11
But a slave born in the priest’s household may eat it, as may one bought with his money.

## Leviticus 22:12
If a priest’s daughter marries someone outside the priesthood, she may not eat the sacred offerings.

## Leviticus 22:13
But if she becomes widowed or divorced and has no children and returns to her father’s house, she may eat her father’s food.

## Leviticus 22:14
If anyone eats a sacred offering in error, they must repay the offering plus a fifth of its value.

## Leviticus 22:15
The priests must not profane the sacred offerings.

## Leviticus 22:16
By allowing unauthorized people to eat them, they would bring guilt and require restitution. I am the Lord who makes them holy.

## Leviticus 22:17
The Lord said to Moses,

## Leviticus 22:18
“Speak to Aaron and his sons and all the Israelites: If anyone brings a sacrifice as a freewill offering to the Lord,

## Leviticus 22:19
it must be a male without defect from the cattle, sheep or goats to be accepted.

## Leviticus 22:20
Do not bring anything with a defect, or it will not be accepted.

## Leviticus 22:21
When anyone brings a fellowship offering to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering, it must be without blemish.

## Leviticus 22:22
Do not offer the Lord a blind, injured, or maimed animal.

## Leviticus 22:23
A bull or lamb with an overgrown or stunted limb may be given as a freewill offering, but not for a vow.

## Leviticus 22:24
Do not offer an animal whose testicles have been bruised, crushed, torn or cut.

## Leviticus 22:25
You must not accept such animals from a foreigner either, because they are defective.

## Leviticus 22:26
The Lord said to Moses,

## Leviticus 22:27
“When a calf, lamb or goat is born, it must stay with its mother for seven days. From the eighth day, it may be accepted as an offering.

## Leviticus 22:28
Do not slaughter a cow or sheep and its young on the same day.

## Leviticus 22:29
When you sacrifice a thank offering to the Lord, do it in a way that is acceptable.

## Leviticus 22:30
It must be eaten that same day; leave none of it until morning.

## Leviticus 22:31
Keep My commands and follow them. I am the Lord.

## Leviticus 22:32
Do not profane My holy name. I must be regarded as holy among the Israelites.

## Leviticus 22:33
I am the Lord, who brought you out of Egypt to be your God; I am the Lord.
