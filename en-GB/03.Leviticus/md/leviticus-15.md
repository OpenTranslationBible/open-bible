If a woman has a discharge of blood for many days, not at the time of her menstrual impurity, or if she has a discharge beyond her period, she shall be unclean as during her menstrual impurity.

## Leviticus 15:26
Any bed on which she lies during her discharge shall be like her bed at menstruation, and everything on which she sits shall be unclean, like her menstrual impurity.

## Leviticus 15:31
You must keep the Israelites separate from their uncleanness, so they do not die in their uncleanness by defiling my dwelling place, which is among them.

## Leviticus 15:32
This is the law for a man with a discharge, and for anyone made unclean by an emission of semen,

## Leviticus 15:33
and for a woman in her menstrual impurity, and for anyone with a discharge, male or female, and for a man who has sexual relations with a woman who is unclean.
