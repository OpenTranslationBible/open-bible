# Leviticus Chapter 6

## Leviticus 6:1
The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

## Leviticus 6:2
“When someone sins and acts unfaithfully against the Lord by deceiving a neighbour concerning a deposit or a security entrusted to them, or through theft, or if they have extorted from their neighbour,

## Leviticus 6:3
or if they find lost property and lie about it, or swear falsely about any such sin that people may commit—

## Leviticus 6:4
when they sin in any of these ways and realise their guilt, they must restore what they have taken by theft or extortion, or what was entrusted to them, or the lost property they found,

## Leviticus 6:5
or whatever it was they swore falsely about. They must make restitution in full, adding a fifth of the value to it, and give it to the rightful owner on the day they present their guilt offering.

## Leviticus 6:6
As a penalty, they must bring to the priest, their guilt offering to the Lord, a ram without defect from the flock, of the proper value.

## Leviticus 6:7
In this way, the priest shall make atonement for them before the Lord, and they will be forgiven for any of the things they did that made them guilty.”

## Leviticus 6:8
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

## Leviticus 6:9
“Command Aaron and his sons, saying, ‘These are the regulations for the burnt offering: The burnt offering is to remain on the altar hearth throughout the night until morning, and the fire on the altar must be kept burning.

## Leviticus 6:10
The priest shall put on his linen robe, with linen undergarments next to his body, and shall remove the ashes of the burnt offering that the fire has consumed on the altar and place them beside the altar.

## Leviticus 6:11
Then he is to take off these garments and put on others, and carry the ashes outside the camp to a ceremonially clean place.

## Leviticus 6:12
The fire on the altar must be kept burning; it must not go out. Every morning the priest is to add firewood, arrange the burnt offering on the fire, and burn the fat of the peace offerings on it.

## Leviticus 6:13
The fire must be kept burning on the altar continuously; it must not go out.

## Leviticus 6:14
“‘These are the regulations for the grain offering: Aaron’s sons are to present it before the Lord, in front of the altar.

## Leviticus 6:15
The priest shall take a handful of the finest flour of the grain offering, with its oil and all the incense on it, and burn the memorial portion on the altar as a soothing aroma to the Lord.

## Leviticus 6:16
Aaron and his sons shall eat the rest of it. It shall be eaten as unleavened bread in a holy place; they are to eat it in the courtyard of the tent of meeting.

## Leviticus 6:17
It must not be baked with yeast. I have given it as their share of the food offerings presented to me. Like the sin offering and the guilt offering, it is most holy.

## Leviticus 6:18
Every male among Aaron’s descendants may eat it. It is a perpetual share of the food offerings presented to the Lord for all generations. Whoever touches them will become holy.’”

## Leviticus 6:19
The Lord also spoke to Moses, saying,

## Leviticus 6:20
“This is the offering Aaron and his sons are to present to the Lord on the day he is anointed: a tenth of an ephah of the finest flour as a regular grain offering, half of it in the morning and half of it in the evening.

## Leviticus 6:21
It must be prepared with oil on a griddle; bring it well-mixed and present the grain offering broken in pieces as a pleasing aroma to the Lord.

## Leviticus 6:22
The son who is to succeed him as anointed priest shall prepare it. It is the Lord’s perpetual share and is to be burned completely.

## Leviticus 6:23
Every grain offering of a priest shall be burned completely; it must not be eaten.”

## Leviticus 6:24
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,

## Leviticus 6:25
“Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying, ‘These are the regulations for the sin offering: The sin offering is to be slaughtered before the Lord in the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered; it is most holy.

## Leviticus 6:26
The priest who offers it for sin shall eat it; it is to be eaten in a holy place, in the courtyard of the tent of meeting.

## Leviticus 6:27
Whatever touches any of its flesh will become holy, and if any of its blood is spattered on a garment, you must wash it in a holy place.

## Leviticus 6:28
The clay pot in which it is cooked must be broken; but if it is cooked in a bronze pot, the pot must be scoured and rinsed with water.

## Leviticus 6:29
Every male among the priests may eat it; it is most holy.

## Leviticus 6:30
But any sin offering whose blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the Holy Place must not be eaten; it must be burned with fire.
