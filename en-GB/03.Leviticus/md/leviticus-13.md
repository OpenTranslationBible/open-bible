# Leviticus Chapter 13

## Leviticus 13:1
The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,

## Leviticus 13:2
“When a person has a swelling, a scab, or a bright spot on the skin of their body, and it becomes a possible infection of leprosy, they must be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons who are priests.

## Leviticus 13:3
The priest shall examine the infected area on the skin, and if the hair in the infection has turned white and the infection appears to be deeper than the skin, it is leprosy. When the priest examines them, he shall declare them unclean.

## Leviticus 13:4
If the bright spot is white on the skin and does not appear to be deeper than the skin, and the hair has not turned white, the priest shall isolate the person for seven days.

## Leviticus 13:5
On the seventh day, the priest shall examine them, and if the infection has not changed and has not spread on the skin, the priest shall isolate them for another seven days.

## Leviticus 13:6
The priest shall examine them again on the seventh day, and if the infection has faded and has not spread, the priest shall pronounce them clean; it is only a rash. They must wash their clothes and will be clean.

## Leviticus 13:7
But if the rash spreads on the skin after they have shown themselves to the priest for cleansing, they must appear again before the priest.

## Leviticus 13:8
The priest shall examine them, and if the rash has spread, he shall pronounce them unclean; it is leprosy.

## Leviticus 13:9
“When a person has an infection of leprosy, they must be brought to the priest.

## Leviticus 13:10
The priest shall examine them, and if there is a white swelling on the skin that has turned the hair white, and there is raw flesh in the swelling,

## Leviticus 13:11
it is a chronic leprosy on the skin, and the priest shall pronounce them unclean. They do not need to be isolated, for they are already unclean.

## Leviticus 13:12
If the leprosy spreads over the skin and covers the entire body from head to foot, as far as the priest can see,

## Leviticus 13:13
the priest shall examine them, and if the leprosy has covered their whole body, he shall pronounce them clean. Since it has all turned white, they are clean.

## Leviticus 13:14
But whenever raw flesh appears on them, they shall be unclean.

## Leviticus 13:15
When the priest sees the raw flesh, he shall declare them unclean; the raw flesh is unclean, it is leprosy.

## Leviticus 13:16
If the raw flesh changes and turns white, they must go to the priest.

## Leviticus 13:17
The priest shall examine them, and if the infected area has turned white, the priest shall pronounce them clean; they are clean.

## Leviticus 13:18
“When there is a boil on the skin and it heals,

## Leviticus 13:19
and in the place of the boil there is a white swelling or a reddish-white bright spot, they must present themselves to the priest.

## Leviticus 13:20
The priest shall examine it, and if it appears to be deeper than the skin and the hair has turned white, the priest shall declare them unclean; it is leprosy that has broken out in the boil.

## Leviticus 13:21
But if the priest examines it and there is no white hair and it is not deeper than the skin and is faded, the priest shall isolate them for seven days.

## Leviticus 13:22
If it spreads on the skin, the priest shall pronounce them unclean; it is an infection.

## Leviticus 13:23
But if the bright spot remains unchanged and has not spread, it is only the scar of the boil, and the priest shall pronounce them clean.

## Leviticus 13:24
“When there is a burn on the skin and the raw flesh of the burn becomes a bright spot, reddish-white or white,

## Leviticus 13:25
the priest shall examine the spot, and if the hair in the bright spot has turned white and it appears deeper than the skin, it is leprosy that has broken out in the burn. The priest shall declare them unclean; it is an infection of leprosy.

## Leviticus 13:26
But if the priest examines it and there is no white hair and it is not deeper than the skin and is dim, the priest shall isolate them for seven days.

## Leviticus 13:27
On the seventh day, the priest shall examine them, and if it spreads on the skin, the priest shall declare them unclean; it is an infection of leprosy.

## Leviticus 13:28
But if the bright spot remains unchanged and has not spread on the skin and is dim, it is the swelling from the burn, and the priest shall pronounce them clean; it is only the scar of the burn.

## Leviticus 13:29
“If a man or woman has an infection on the head or on the beard,

## Leviticus 13:30
the priest shall examine the infection, and if it appears deeper than the skin and there is thin yellowish hair, the priest shall declare them unclean; it is a scale, it is leprosy of the head or beard.

## Leviticus 13:31
But if the priest examines the scaly infection and it does not appear deeper than the skin and there is no black hair, the priest shall isolate them for seven days.

## Leviticus 13:32
On the seventh day, the priest shall examine the infection, and if the scale has not spread and no yellowish hair has grown, and it does not appear deeper than the skin,

## Leviticus 13:33
they must shave themselves, except for the affected area, and the priest shall isolate them for another seven days.

## Leviticus 13:34
On the seventh day, the priest shall examine the scale, and if it has not spread and appears no deeper than the skin, the priest shall pronounce them clean. They must wash their clothes and will be clean.

## Leviticus 13:35
But if the scale spreads on the skin after they are pronounced clean,

## Leviticus 13:36
the priest shall examine them, and if the scale has spread, he does not need to look for yellowish hair; they are unclean.

## Leviticus 13:37
If the scale remains unchanged and black hair has grown in it, the scale has healed, and they are clean; the priest shall declare them clean.

## Leviticus 13:38
“When a man or woman has bright spots on the skin, white bright spots,

## Leviticus 13:39
the priest shall examine them, and if the bright spots are faint white, it is eczema that has broken out on the skin; they are clean.

## Leviticus 13:40
“If a man loses the hair of his head, he is bald but clean.

## Leviticus 13:41
If he loses hair from the front and sides of his scalp, he is bald on the forehead but clean.

## Leviticus 13:42
But if on the bald head or forehead there is a reddish-white infection, it is leprosy breaking out on his bald head or forehead.

## Leviticus 13:43
The priest shall examine him, and if the swelling of the infection is reddish-white on his bald head or forehead, like the appearance of leprosy on the skin,

## Leviticus 13:44
he is a leprous man and is unclean. The priest must declare him unclean because of the infection on his head.

## Leviticus 13:45
“A person with such an infection must wear torn clothes, let their hair be unkempt, cover the lower part of their face, and cry out, ‘Unclean! Unclean!’

## Leviticus 13:46
They must remain unclean as long as they have the infection. They must live alone outside the camp.

## Leviticus 13:47
“When a garment has a mark of leprosy, whether it is a woollen or linen garment,

## Leviticus 13:48
whether in warp or woof, of linen or wool, or in leather or any article made of leather,

## Leviticus 13:49
if the mark is greenish or reddish in the garment or leather, whether in the warp or woof, or in any leather article, it is a leprous mark and must be shown to the priest.

## Leviticus 13:50
The priest shall examine the mark and isolate the article for seven days.

## Leviticus 13:51
On the seventh day, he shall examine the mark, and if it has spread in the garment, warp or woof, or leather, it is a leprous malignancy and is unclean.

## Leviticus 13:52
He must burn the garment, whether warp or woof, in wool or linen, or any leather article where the mark occurs; it is a leprous malignancy. It must be burned in the fire.

## Leviticus 13:53
But if the priest examines it and the mark has not spread in the garment, warp or woof, or any leather article,

## Leviticus 13:54
the priest shall order the article to be washed and isolate it for another seven days.

## Leviticus 13:55
After the article has been washed, the priest shall examine it again, and if the mark has not changed its appearance, even if it has not spread, it is unclean. Burn it, whether the mark is on the back or front.

## Leviticus 13:56
But if the priest examines it and the mark has faded after washing, he shall tear it out of the garment, leather, warp, or woof.

## Leviticus 13:57
If it reappears in the garment, warp or woof, or any leather article, it is a spreading mark; the article must be burned.

## Leviticus 13:58
Any garment, warp or woof, or any leather article from which the mark has disappeared after washing must be washed again and will be clean.”

## Leviticus 13:59
These are the regulations for the mark of leprosy in a woollen or linen garment, warp or woof, or any leather article, for declaring it clean or unclean.
