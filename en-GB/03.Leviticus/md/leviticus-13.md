# Leviticus Chapter 13

## Leviticus 13:1
The Lord said to Moses and Aaron,

## Leviticus 13:2
“When anyone has a swelling or rash or discolouration on their skin that may be a defiling skin disease, they must be brought to Aaron the priest or one of his sons.

## Leviticus 13:3
The priest is to examine the skin. If the hair in the sore has turned white and the sore appears deeper than the skin, it is a defiling disease. The priest must pronounce them unclean.

## Leviticus 13:4
If the sore has not changed in colour or does not appear to be deeper than the skin and there is no white hair in it, the priest must isolate the person for seven days.

## Leviticus 13:5
On the seventh day, the priest shall examine them. If the sore remains unchanged and has not spread, they must be isolated for another seven days.

## Leviticus 13:6
After that, if the sore has faded and not spread, the priest shall pronounce them clean—it was only a rash. They must wash their clothes.

## Leviticus 13:7
But if the rash spreads after the priest has pronounced them clean, they must go back to the priest.

## Leviticus 13:8
The priest will examine them again, and if the rash has spread, they are unclean.

## Leviticus 13:9
If someone has a defiling disease, they must be brought to the priest.

## Leviticus 13:10
The priest is to examine them, and if there is a white swelling and raw flesh in it,

## Leviticus 13:11
it is a chronic disease. The priest shall declare them unclean without isolating them—they are already unclean.

## Leviticus 13:12
If the disease spreads and covers the skin completely,

## Leviticus 13:13
then the priest is to pronounce them clean, provided all the skin has turned white—they are clean.

## Leviticus 13:14
But if raw flesh appears, they are unclean.

## Leviticus 13:15
The priest is to examine the raw flesh and declare them unclean. Raw flesh indicates impurity.

## Leviticus 13:16
If the raw flesh turns white again, the person must go back to the priest.

## Leviticus 13:17
The priest shall re-examine, and if the sore has turned white, they are clean.

## Leviticus 13:18
If someone has a boil and it heals,

## Leviticus 13:19
but a white swelling or reddish-white spot appears where the boil was, they must show themselves to the priest.

## Leviticus 13:20
If it seems deeper than the skin and the hair has turned white, it is a defiling disease. The priest must declare them unclean.

## Leviticus 13:21
If it does not appear deeper and there is no white hair, the person must be isolated.

## Leviticus 13:22
If the sore spreads, they are unclean.

## Leviticus 13:23
But if it stays the same, it is only a scar from the boil.

## Leviticus 13:24
If someone has a burn on their skin and it becomes a reddish-white or white spot,

## Leviticus 13:25
the priest shall examine it. If the hair in the spot has turned white and it appears deeper, it is a defiling disease. The person is unclean.

## Leviticus 13:26
If there is no white hair and the spot is not deeper than the skin, the priest shall isolate them.

## Leviticus 13:27
If it spreads, they are unclean. If it remains the same, it is only a burn scar.

## Leviticus 13:28
If someone, male or female, has a sore on the head or chin,

## Leviticus 13:29
the priest shall examine the sore. If it appears deeper than the skin and the hair is thin and yellow, they are unclean—it is a defiling disease.

## Leviticus 13:30
If it does not appear deeper and there is no black hair, the priest must isolate the person.

## Leviticus 13:31
If after seven days it has not spread and no yellow hair appears, they are clean.

## Leviticus 13:32
If the sore spreads and yellow hair appears, the person is unclean.

## Leviticus 13:33
They must shave around the sore but not touch the sore itself.

## Leviticus 13:34
If the area does not spread, the person must wash their clothes and they will be clean.

## Leviticus 13:35
But if it spreads after they have been pronounced clean, they must go to the priest again.

## Leviticus 13:36
The priest will examine them and declare them unclean if it has spread.

## Leviticus 13:37
If the sore has not spread and black hair has grown back, the person is clean.

## Leviticus 13:38
If someone has white patches on the skin, the priest must examine them.

## Leviticus 13:39
If the patches are dull white, it is a harmless rash and the person is clean.

## Leviticus 13:40
If a man loses his hair and becomes bald, he is clean.

## Leviticus 13:41
If he loses hair from the front of his scalp, he is clean.

## Leviticus 13:42
But if a reddish-white sore appears on the bald head or forehead, it is a defiling disease.

## Leviticus 13:43
The priest must examine it, and if it resembles a skin disease, the man is unclean.

## Leviticus 13:44
He must be pronounced unclean. The disease is on his head.

## Leviticus 13:45
Anyone with such a disease must wear torn clothes, let their hair be unkempt, cover the lower part of their face and cry out, ‘Unclean! Unclean!’

## Leviticus 13:46
As long as they have the disease, they remain unclean and must live outside the camp.

## Leviticus 13:47
If any fabric—wool or linen—has a defiling mould,

## Leviticus 13:48
whether woven or knitted, or any leather article,

## Leviticus 13:49
and if the spot is greenish or reddish, it must be shown to the priest.

## Leviticus 13:50
The priest shall examine it and isolate it for seven days.

## Leviticus 13:51
If the mould has spread, it is a defiling mould and the article is unclean.

## Leviticus 13:52
He must burn the fabric or leather because the mould is persistent.

## Leviticus 13:53
But if the mould has not spread, he shall wash the article.

## Leviticus 13:54
Then he must isolate it for another seven days.

## Leviticus 13:55
If it has faded, he is to tear out the affected part.

## Leviticus 13:56
If the mould reappears, it must be burned.

## Leviticus 13:57
But if it disappears after washing, it must be washed again, and it will be clean.

## Leviticus 13:58
These are the regulations for defiling moulds in fabrics or leather.

## Leviticus 13:59
To determine whether it is clean or unclean.
