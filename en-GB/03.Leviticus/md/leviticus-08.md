# Leviticus Chapter 8

## Leviticus 8:1
The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,

## Leviticus 8:2
“Bring Aaron and his sons, along with their garments, the anointing oil, the bull for the sin offering, the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread,

## Leviticus 8:3
and assemble the entire congregation at the entrance to the tent of meeting.”

## Leviticus 8:4
Moses did just as the Lord commanded him, and the congregation gathered at the entrance to the tent of meeting.

## Leviticus 8:5
Moses said to the congregation, “This is what the Lord has commanded to be done.”

## Leviticus 8:6
Then Moses brought Aaron and his sons forward and washed them with water.

## Leviticus 8:7
He clothed Aaron with the tunic, tied the sash around him, dressed him in the robe, and placed the ephod on him. He also fastened the ephod with a decorative waistband, securing it around him.

## Leviticus 8:8
He placed the breastpiece on him and put the Urim and Thummim into the breastpiece.

## Leviticus 8:9
He set the turban on Aaron’s head and placed the gold plate, the holy emblem, on the front of the turban, as the Lord commanded Moses.

## Leviticus 8:10
Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and everything within it, consecrating them.

## Leviticus 8:11
He sprinkled some of the oil on the altar seven times, anointing the altar and all its utensils, as well as the basin with its stand, to consecrate them.

## Leviticus 8:12
He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head, anointing him to consecrate him.

## Leviticus 8:13
Moses then brought Aaron’s sons forward, dressed them in tunics, tied sashes around them, and bound caps on them, as the Lord commanded Moses.

## Leviticus 8:14
He presented the bull for the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.

## Leviticus 8:15
Moses slaughtered the bull, took some of the blood, and with his finger put it on the horns of the altar to purify it. He poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar, consecrating it to make atonement for it.

## Leviticus 8:16
He took all the fat surrounding the internal organs, the long lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys with their fat, and burned them on the altar.

## Leviticus 8:17
But the bull, with its hide, flesh, and intestines, he burned outside the camp, as the Lord commanded Moses.

## Leviticus 8:18
He then presented the ram for the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.

## Leviticus 8:19
Moses slaughtered the ram and sprinkled the blood around the altar.

## Leviticus 8:20
He cut the ram into pieces and burned the head, the pieces, and the fat.

## Leviticus 8:21
After washing the internal organs and the legs with water, he burned the whole ram on the altar. It was a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma, an offering by fire to the Lord, as the Lord commanded Moses.

## Leviticus 8:22
He then presented the second ram, the ram of ordination, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.

## Leviticus 8:23
Moses slaughtered the ram and took some of its blood, putting it on the lobe of Aaron’s right ear, the thumb of his right hand, and the big toe of his right foot.

## Leviticus 8:24
He also brought Aaron’s sons forward and put some of the blood on the lobes of their right ears, the thumbs of their right hands, and the big toes of their right feet. Moses then sprinkled the rest of the blood around the altar.

## Leviticus 8:25
He took the fat, the fat tail, all the fat around the internal organs, the long lobe of the liver, the two kidneys with their fat, and the right thigh.

## Leviticus 8:26
From the basket of unleavened bread before the Lord, he took one thick loaf, one loaf with olive oil, and one thin loaf, placing them on the fat portions and the right thigh.

## Leviticus 8:27
He placed all these in the hands of Aaron and his sons, and waved them before the Lord as a wave offering.

## Leviticus 8:28
Moses then took them from their hands and burned them on the altar on top of the burnt offering. They were an ordination offering, a pleasing aroma, an offering by fire to the Lord.

## Leviticus 8:29
Moses took the breast and waved it before the Lord as a wave offering; it was his portion of the ordination ram, as the Lord commanded Moses.

## Leviticus 8:30
Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood from the altar and sprinkled it on Aaron and his garments, and on his sons and their garments. Thus, he consecrated Aaron and his garments, and his sons and their garments.

## Leviticus 8:31
Moses then instructed Aaron and his sons, “Boil the meat at the entrance to the tent of meeting and eat it there with the bread from the basket of ordination offerings, as I was commanded: ‘Aaron and his sons shall eat it.’

## Leviticus 8:32
Burn the remainder of the meat and bread.

## Leviticus 8:33
Do not leave the entrance to the tent of meeting for seven days, until the period of your ordination is completed, for your ordination will last seven days.

## Leviticus 8:34
What has been done today was commanded by the Lord to make atonement for you.

## Leviticus 8:35
You must remain at the entrance to the tent of meeting day and night for seven days and perform your duty to the Lord, so that you will not die; for that is what I have been commanded.”

## Leviticus 8:36
Thus Aaron and his sons did all the things which the Lord had commanded through Moses.
