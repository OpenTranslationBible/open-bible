# Leviticus Chapter 16

## Leviticus 16:1
The Lord spoke to Moses following the death of Aaron's two sons, who died after approaching the presence of the Lord.

## Leviticus 16:2
The Lord instructed Moses: “Tell your brother Aaron that he must not enter the Holy Place behind the veil, before the atonement cover on the ark, at just any time, or he will die; for I appear in the cloud over the atonement cover.

## Leviticus 16:3
Aaron is to enter the Holy Place with a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering.

## Leviticus 16:4
He shall wear the holy linen tunic, with linen undergarments next to his body, and be girded with the linen sash, and he shall wear the linen turban. These are sacred garments, so he must bathe his body in water before putting them on.

## Leviticus 16:5
He shall take from the Israelite community two male goats for a sin offering and one ram for a burnt offering.

## Leviticus 16:6
Aaron shall offer the bull for his own sin offering to make atonement for himself and his household.

## Leviticus 16:7
He shall then take the two goats and present them before the Lord at the entrance of the tent of meeting.

## Leviticus 16:8
Aaron shall cast lots for the two goats—one lot for the Lord and the other for the scapegoat.

## Leviticus 16:9
Aaron shall offer the goat on which the lot for the Lord falls and sacrifice it for a sin offering.

## Leviticus 16:10
But the goat chosen by lot as the scapegoat shall be presented alive before the Lord to make atonement over it, to send it into the wilderness as a scapegoat.

## Leviticus 16:11
Aaron shall bring the bull for his own sin offering to make atonement for himself and his household, and he shall slaughter the bull for his own sin offering.

## Leviticus 16:12
He shall take a censer full of burning coals from the altar before the Lord and two handfuls of finely ground fragrant incense, and bring them inside the veil.

## Leviticus 16:13
He shall put the incense on the fire before the Lord, and the cloud of incense will cover the atonement cover above the tablets of the covenant law, so that he will not die.

## Leviticus 16:14
He shall take some of the bull’s blood and sprinkle it with his finger on the front of the atonement cover; he shall sprinkle some of it with his finger seven times before the atonement cover.

## Leviticus 16:15
He shall then slaughter the goat for the sin offering for the people and bring its blood inside the veil, doing with it as he did with the bull’s blood: sprinkling it on the atonement cover and in front of it.

## Leviticus 16:16
In this way, he will make atonement for the Holy Place because of the uncleanness and rebellion of the Israelites, whatever their sins have been. He shall do the same for the tent of meeting, which is among them in the midst of their uncleanness.

## Leviticus 16:17
No one is to be in the tent of meeting from the time Aaron enters to make atonement in the Holy Place until he comes out, having made atonement for himself, his household, and the entire community of Israel.

## Leviticus 16:18
Then he shall go out to the altar before the Lord and make atonement for it. He shall take some of the bull’s blood and some of the goat’s blood and put it on all the horns of the altar.

## Leviticus 16:19
He shall sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times to cleanse and consecrate it from the uncleanness of the Israelites.

## Leviticus 16:20
When Aaron has finished making atonement for the Holy Place, the tent of meeting, and the altar, he shall bring forward the live goat.

## Leviticus 16:21
He shall lay both hands on the head of the live goat and confess over it all the wickedness and rebellion of the Israelites—all their sins—and put them on the goat’s head. He shall send the goat away into the wilderness in the care of someone appointed for the task.

## Leviticus 16:22
The goat will carry on itself all their sins to a remote place; and the man shall release it in the wilderness.

## Leviticus 16:23
Then Aaron shall go into the tent of meeting and take off the linen garments he put on before he entered the Holy Place, and he shall leave them there.

## Leviticus 16:24
He shall bathe his body with water in a holy place and put on his regular garments. Then he shall come out and offer his burnt offering and the burnt offering of the people, to make atonement for himself and for the people.

## Leviticus 16:25
He shall also burn the fat of the sin offering on the altar.

## Leviticus 16:26
The man who releases the goat as the scapegoat must wash his clothes and bathe his body with water; afterward, he may come into the camp.

## Leviticus 16:27
The bull and the goat for the sin offerings, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the Holy Place, shall be taken outside the camp; their hides, flesh, and intestines are to be burned.

## Leviticus 16:28
The man who burns them must wash his clothes and bathe his body with water; afterward, he may come into the camp.

## Leviticus 16:29
This shall be a lasting ordinance for you: In the seventh month, on the tenth day, you must humble yourselves and do no work, whether native-born or a foreigner residing among you,

## Leviticus 16:30
because on this day atonement will be made for you, to cleanse you. Before the Lord, you will be clean from all your sins.

## Leviticus 16:31
It is a Sabbath of solemn rest, and you must humble yourselves; it is a lasting ordinance.

## Leviticus 16:32
The priest who is anointed and ordained to succeed his father as high priest shall make atonement. He shall put on the sacred linen garments,

## Leviticus 16:33
and make atonement for the holy sanctuary, the tent of meeting, and the altar. He shall also make atonement for the priests and all the members of the community.

## Leviticus 16:34
This shall be a lasting ordinance for you: Atonement is to be made once a year for all the sins of the Israelites.” And it was done, as the Lord commanded Moses.
