# Leviticus Chapter 4

## Leviticus 4:1
The Lord addressed Moses with these words,

## Leviticus 4:2
“Speak to the Israelites and say: ‘If anyone sins unintentionally in any of the things the Lord has commanded not to be done, and commits any of them—

## Leviticus 4:3
if the anointed priest sins, bringing guilt upon the people, he must present to the Lord a young bull without defect as a sin offering for the sin he has committed.

## Leviticus 4:4
He shall bring the bull to the entrance of the tent of meeting before the Lord, lay his hand on its head, and slaughter it there before the Lord.

## Leviticus 4:5
The anointed priest is to take some of the bull’s blood and carry it into the tent of meeting.

## Leviticus 4:6
He is to dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times before the Lord, in front of the veil of the sanctuary.

## Leviticus 4:7
The priest shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of fragrant incense before the Lord in the tent of meeting, and the rest of the bull’s blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering at the entrance to the tent of meeting.

## Leviticus 4:8
He shall remove all the fat from the bull of the sin offering—the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails,

## Leviticus 4:9
the two kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the long lobe of the liver, which he will remove with the kidneys—

## Leviticus 4:10
just as it is removed from the ox of the sacrifice of peace offerings. Then the priest shall burn them on the altar of burnt offering.

## Leviticus 4:11
But the hide of the bull and all its flesh, along with its head, legs, entrails, and refuse—

## Leviticus 4:12
that is, all the rest of the bull—he must take to a clean place outside the camp where the ashes are poured out, and burn it there on a wood fire; where the ashes are poured out it shall be burned.

## Leviticus 4:13
‘If the whole Israelite community sins unintentionally and the matter escapes the notice of the assembly, and they do any of the things the Lord has commanded not to be done, and become guilty;

## Leviticus 4:14
when the sin they have committed becomes known, the assembly must bring a young bull as a sin offering and present it before the tent of meeting.

## Leviticus 4:15
The elders of the community shall lay their hands on the bull’s head before the Lord, and the bull shall be slaughtered before the Lord.

## Leviticus 4:16
Then the anointed priest shall bring some of the bull’s blood to the tent of meeting.

## Leviticus 4:17
He shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times before the Lord, in front of the veil.

## Leviticus 4:18
He shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar before the Lord in the tent of meeting, and the rest of the blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering at the entrance to the tent of meeting.

## Leviticus 4:19
He shall remove all its fat and burn it on the altar,

## Leviticus 4:20
and do with this bull just as he did with the bull of the sin offering. In this way the priest will make atonement for them, and they will be forgiven.

## Leviticus 4:21
Then he shall bring the bull outside the camp and burn it as he burned the first bull. This is the sin offering for the assembly.

## Leviticus 4:22
‘When a leader sins unintentionally and does any of the things the Lord his God has commanded not to be done, and becomes guilty,

## Leviticus 4:23
if his sin which he has committed becomes known, he shall bring as his offering a male goat without defect.

## Leviticus 4:24
He shall lay his hand on the goat’s head and slaughter it at the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered before the Lord. It is a sin offering.

## Leviticus 4:25
Then the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and the rest of the blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar.

## Leviticus 4:26
He shall burn all the fat on the altar as he burned the fat of the peace offering. In this way the priest will make atonement for him regarding his sin, and he will be forgiven.

## Leviticus 4:27
‘If any member of the community sins unintentionally by doing any of the things the Lord has commanded not to be done, and becomes guilty,

## Leviticus 4:28
if the sin which he has committed is made known to him, he shall bring as his offering a female goat without defect for his sin which he has committed.

## Leviticus 4:29
He shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter it at the place of the burnt offering.

## Leviticus 4:30
The priest shall take some of its blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and the rest of its blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar.

## Leviticus 4:31
He shall remove all its fat, just as the fat was removed from the peace offerings, and the priest shall burn it on the altar as a pleasing aroma to the Lord. In this way the priest will make atonement for him, and he will be forgiven.

## Leviticus 4:32
‘If he brings a lamb as his offering for a sin offering, he shall bring a female without defect.

## Leviticus 4:33
He shall lay his hand on its head and slaughter it for a sin offering at the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered.

## Leviticus 4:34
Then the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and the rest of its blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar.

## Leviticus 4:35
He shall remove all its fat, just as the fat of the lamb is removed from the peace offerings, and the priest shall burn it on the altar, on the offerings by fire to the Lord. In this way the priest will make atonement for him for the sin he has committed, and he will be forgiven.
