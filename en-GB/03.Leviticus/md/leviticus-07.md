# Leviticus Chapter 7

## Leviticus 7:1
‘These are the guidelines for the guilt offering; it is most sacred.

## Leviticus 7:2
The guilt offering is to be slaughtered in the same place as the burnt offering, and its blood shall be sprinkled around the altar.

## Leviticus 7:3
He shall offer all its fat: the fat tail and the fat that covers the internal organs,

## Leviticus 7:4
and the two kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the long lobe of the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys.

## Leviticus 7:5
The priest shall burn them on the altar as a fire offering to the Lord; it is a guilt offering.

## Leviticus 7:6
Every male among the priests may eat it. It must be eaten in a holy place; it is most sacred.

## Leviticus 7:7
The same rule applies to both the sin offering and the guilt offering: they belong to the priest who makes atonement with them.

## Leviticus 7:8
The priest who presents a burnt offering for anyone shall have the hide of the burnt offering for himself.

## Leviticus 7:9
Every grain offering baked in an oven or cooked in a pan or on a griddle is for the priest who offers it.

## Leviticus 7:10
Every grain offering, whether mixed with oil or dry, belongs equally to all the sons of Aaron.

## Leviticus 7:11
‘These are the guidelines for the sacrifice of peace offerings that one may present to the Lord:

## Leviticus 7:12
If he offers it as a thanksgiving, then along with the sacrifice of thanksgiving he shall offer unleavened cakes mixed with oil, unleavened wafers spread with oil, and cakes of fine flour well-kneaded and mixed with oil.

## Leviticus 7:13
With the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving, he shall present cakes of leavened bread.

## Leviticus 7:14
He is to bring one of each kind as an offering, a contribution to the Lord; it shall belong to the priest who sprinkles the blood of the peace offerings.

## Leviticus 7:15
The flesh of the sacrifice of his thanksgiving peace offerings must be eaten on the day it is offered; none of it shall be left until the morning.

## Leviticus 7:16
But if the sacrifice of his offering is a vow or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten on the day he offers his sacrifice, and what is left over may be eaten on the next day.

## Leviticus 7:17
Any flesh of the sacrifice left over until the third day must be burned with fire.

## Leviticus 7:18
If any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings is eaten on the third day, it will not be accepted, nor credited to him; it will be an unclean thing, and whoever eats it shall bear his iniquity.

## Leviticus 7:19
Flesh that touches anything unclean must not be eaten; it shall be burned with fire. As for other flesh, anyone who is clean may eat it.

## Leviticus 7:20
But if anyone eats the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings that belong to the Lord while he is unclean, that person shall be cut off from his people.

## Leviticus 7:21
Anyone who touches anything unclean, whether human uncleanness or an unclean animal or any unclean detestable thing, and eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings that belong to the Lord, shall be cut off from his people.’”

## Leviticus 7:22
The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,

## Leviticus 7:23
“Speak to the Israelites, saying, ‘You shall not eat any of the fat of an ox, sheep, or goat.

## Leviticus 7:24
The fat of an animal found dead or torn by wild animals may be used for other purposes, but you must not eat it.

## Leviticus 7:25
Anyone who eats the fat of an animal from which an offering by fire may be presented to the Lord must be cut off from his people.

## Leviticus 7:26
And wherever you dwell, you must not eat any blood, whether of bird or animal.

## Leviticus 7:27
Anyone who eats any blood shall be cut off from his people.’”

## Leviticus 7:28
The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,

## Leviticus 7:29
“Speak to the Israelites, saying, ‘Anyone who offers the sacrifice of his peace offerings to the Lord shall bring part of it as his offering to the Lord.

## Leviticus 7:30
With his own hands he shall bring the offerings made by fire to the Lord; he shall bring the fat with the breast, that the breast may be waved as a wave offering before the Lord.

## Leviticus 7:31
The priest shall burn the fat on the altar, but the breast shall belong to Aaron and his sons.

## Leviticus 7:32
You are to give the right thigh to the priest as a contribution from the sacrifices of your peace offerings.

## Leviticus 7:33
The son of Aaron who offers the blood and the fat of the peace offerings shall have the right thigh as his portion.

## Leviticus 7:34
For I have taken the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the contribution from the sacrifices of the Israelites’ peace offerings and have given them to Aaron the priest and his sons as their perpetual share from the Israelites.’”

## Leviticus 7:35
This is the portion of the offerings made by fire to the Lord that were allotted to Aaron and his sons on the day they were presented to serve the Lord as priests.

## Leviticus 7:36
On the day they were anointed, the Lord instructed that the Israelites give this to them as their perpetual share for the generations to come.

## Leviticus 7:37
These, then, are the guidelines for the burnt offering, the grain offering, the sin offering, the guilt offering, the ordination offering, and the peace offering,

## Leviticus 7:38
which the Lord commanded Moses on Mount Sinai on the day he instructed the Israelites to bring their offerings to the Lord in the wilderness of Sinai.
