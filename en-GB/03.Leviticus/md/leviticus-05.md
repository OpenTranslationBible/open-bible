# Leviticus Chapter 5

## Leviticus 5:1

“If an individual sins by failing to speak up when they hear a public call to testify about something they have witnessed or know, they will be held accountable.

## Leviticus 5:2

Or if a person becomes aware of their guilt after unknowingly touching anything that is ceremonially unclean—be it the carcass of an unclean animal, whether wild or domestic, or any unclean creature that moves along the ground—and they realise their impurity;

## Leviticus 5:3

Or if they touch human uncleanness, whatever form it may take, and it is hidden from them, but later they become aware of it, they will be guilty.

## Leviticus 5:4

Or if someone makes a rash oath to do anything, whether good or bad, in any matter people might carelessly swear about, and it is hidden from them, but later they become aware of it and realise their guilt—

## Leviticus 5:5

When they become aware of their guilt in any of these matters, they must confess how they have sinned.

## Leviticus 5:6

As a penalty for the sin they have committed, they must bring to the Lord a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat, as a sin offering; and the priest will make atonement on their behalf for their sin.

## Leviticus 5:7

If they cannot afford a lamb, they are to bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the Lord as a penalty for their sin—one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering.

## Leviticus 5:8

They are to present them to the priest, who shall first offer the one for the sin offering. He is to pinch off its head at the front of its neck, but not sever it completely,

## Leviticus 5:9

and sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering against the side of the altar; the rest of the blood is to be drained out at the base of the altar. It is a sin offering.

## Leviticus 5:10

The second bird he shall prepare as a burnt offering according to the ordinance. Thus the priest will make atonement on their behalf for the sin they have committed, and they will be forgiven.

## Leviticus 5:11

If, however, their means are insufficient for two turtledoves or two young pigeons, they are to bring as an offering for their sin a tenth of an ephah of the finest flour. They must not put olive oil or incense on it, for it is a sin offering.

## Leviticus 5:12

They are to bring it to the priest, who shall take a handful of it as a memorial portion and burn it on the altar with the offerings made by fire to the Lord. It is a sin offering.

## Leviticus 5:13

In this way, the priest will make atonement for them concerning any of these sins they have committed, and they will be forgiven. The remainder of the offering will belong to the priest, as in the case of the grain offering.’”

## Leviticus 5:14

The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying,

## Leviticus 5:15

“If anyone acts unfaithfully and sins unintentionally in regard to any of the Lord’s holy things, they must bring to the Lord as a guilt offering a ram without defect from the flock, valued in silver shekels according to the sanctuary shekel. It is a guilt offering.

## Leviticus 5:16

They must make restitution for what they have failed to do in regard to the holy things, adding a fifth of its value and giving it to the priest. The priest will make atonement for them with the ram as a guilt offering, and they will be forgiven.

## Leviticus 5:17

If anyone sins and does what is forbidden in any of the Lord’s commands, even if they are unaware, they are guilty and will bear the consequences.

## Leviticus 5:18

They are to bring to the priest a ram without defect from the flock, valued according to your assessment, as a guilt offering. In this way, the priest will make atonement for them for the wrong they have committed unintentionally, and they will be forgiven.

## Leviticus 5:19

It is a guilt offering; they have indeed been guilty before the Lord.”
