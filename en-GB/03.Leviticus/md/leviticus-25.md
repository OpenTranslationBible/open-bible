# Leviticus Chapter 25

## Leviticus 25:1
The Lord communicated to Moses at Mount Sinai,

## Leviticus 25:2
“Speak to the Israelites and tell them, ‘When you enter the land that I am giving you, the land must observe a sabbath to the Lord.

## Leviticus 25:3
For six years you may sow your fields and prune your vineyards and gather their produce,

## Leviticus 25:4
but in the seventh year the land shall have a sabbath rest, a sabbath to the Lord; you shall not sow your fields or prune your vineyards.

## Leviticus 25:5
You shall not reap what grows of itself or gather the grapes from your untrimmed vines; the land shall have a year of rest.

## Leviticus 25:6
Whatever the land yields during the sabbath year will be food for you—for yourself, your male and female servants, and the hired worker and foreign resident living among you,

## Leviticus 25:7
and also for your livestock and the wild animals in your land. Whatever the land produces may be eaten.

## Leviticus 25:8
“‘You shall count off seven sabbath years—seven times seven years—so that the seven sabbath years amount to a period of forty-nine years.

## Leviticus 25:9
Then sound a trumpet throughout the land on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the Day of Atonement you shall sound the trumpet throughout your land.

## Leviticus 25:10
Consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you; each of you shall return to your property and to your family.

## Leviticus 25:11
The fiftieth year shall be a jubilee for you; you shall not sow, nor harvest what grows of itself, nor gather grapes from untrimmed vines.

## Leviticus 25:12
For it is a jubilee and shall be holy to you; you shall eat only what is taken directly from the fields.

## Leviticus 25:13
“‘In this Year of Jubilee, each of you shall return to your property.

## Leviticus 25:14
“‘If you sell land to any of your own people or buy land from them, do not take advantage of one another.

## Leviticus 25:15
You are to purchase from your own people based on the number of years since the Jubilee, and they are to sell to you according to the number of years left for harvesting crops.

## Leviticus 25:16
In proportion to a greater number of years you shall increase the price, and in proportion to fewer years you shall decrease the price, because it is the number of crops that is being sold to you.

## Leviticus 25:17
Do not take advantage of one another, but fear your God; for I am the Lord your God.

## Leviticus 25:18
“‘Follow my decrees and be careful to obey my laws, and you will live securely in the land.

## Leviticus 25:19
Then the land will yield its produce, and you will eat your fill and live securely on it.

## Leviticus 25:20
You may ask, “What shall we eat in the seventh year if we do not plant or harvest our crops?”

## Leviticus 25:21
I will command my blessing for you in the sixth year so that the land will yield enough for three years.

## Leviticus 25:22
While you are sowing during the eighth year, you will eat from the old produce and continue to eat from it until the ninth year when its produce comes in.

## Leviticus 25:23
“‘The land must not be sold permanently, because the land is mine and you reside in my land as sojourners and guests.

## Leviticus 25:24
Throughout the land that you hold as a possession, you must ensure the redemption of the land.

## Leviticus 25:25
“‘If one of your fellow Israelites becomes poor and sells some of their property, their nearest relative is to come and reclaim what they have sold.

## Leviticus 25:26
If, however, there is no one to redeem it for them but later on they prosper and acquire sufficient means to redeem it themselves,

## Leviticus 25:27
they are to calculate the value for the years since they sold it and refund the balance to the one to whom they sold it; they can then return to their property.

## Leviticus 25:28
But if they do not acquire the means to repay, what was sold will remain with the buyer until the Year of Jubilee. It will be returned in the Jubilee, and they can then return to their property.

## Leviticus 25:29
“‘Anyone who sells a house in a walled city retains the right of redemption for a full year after its sale. During that time, the seller may redeem it.

## Leviticus 25:30
If it is not redeemed before a full year has passed, the house in the walled city shall belong permanently to the buyer and their descendants. It is not to be returned in the Jubilee.

## Leviticus 25:31
But houses in villages without walls around them are to be considered as belonging to the open country. They can be redeemed, and they are to be returned in the Jubilee.

## Leviticus 25:32
“‘The Levites have the perpetual right to redeem their houses in the Levitical towns, which they possess.

## Leviticus 25:33
So the property of the Levites is redeemable—that is, a house sold in any town they hold—and is to be returned in the Jubilee, because the houses in the towns of the Levites are their possession among the Israelites.

## Leviticus 25:34
But the pastureland belonging to their towns must not be sold; it is their permanent possession.

## Leviticus 25:35
“‘If any of your fellow Israelites become poor and are unable to support themselves among you, assist them as you would a foreigner and guest, so they can continue to live among you.

## Leviticus 25:36
Do not take interest or any profit from them, but fear your God, so that they may continue to live among you.

## Leviticus 25:37
You must not lend them money at interest or sell them food at a profit.

## Leviticus 25:38
I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God.

## Leviticus 25:39
“‘If any of your fellow Israelites become poor and sell themselves to you, do not make them work as slaves.

## Leviticus 25:40
They are to be treated as hired workers or temporary residents among you; they are to work for you until the Year of Jubilee.

## Leviticus 25:41
Then they and their children are to be released, and they will return to their own clans and to the property of their ancestors.

## Leviticus 25:42
Because the Israelites are my servants, whom I brought out of Egypt, they must not be sold as slaves.

## Leviticus 25:43
Do not rule over them with harshness, but fear your God.

## Leviticus 25:44
“‘Your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you; from them you may acquire slaves.

## Leviticus 25:45
You may also acquire some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country, and they will become your property.

## Leviticus 25:46
You can bequeath them to your children as inherited property and can make them slaves for life, but you must not rule over your fellow Israelites with harshness.

## Leviticus 25:47
“‘If a foreigner residing among you becomes prosperous and any of your fellow Israelites become poor and sell themselves to the foreigner or to a member of the foreigner’s clan,

## Leviticus 25:48
they retain the right of redemption after they have sold themselves. One of their relatives may redeem them:

## Leviticus 25:49
An uncle or a cousin or any blood relative in their clan may redeem them. Or if they prosper, they may redeem themselves.

## Leviticus 25:50
They and their buyer are to calculate the time from the year they sold themselves up to the Year of Jubilee. The price for their release is to be based on the rate paid to a hired worker for that number of years.

## Leviticus 25:51
If many years remain, they must pay for their redemption a larger share of the price paid for them.

## Leviticus 25:52
If only a few years remain until the Year of Jubilee, they are to compute that and pay for their redemption accordingly.

## Leviticus 25:53
They are to be treated as workers hired from year to year; you must ensure that those to whom they owe service do not rule over them with harshness.

## Leviticus 25:54
“‘Even if someone is not redeemed in any of these ways, they and their children are to be released in the Year of Jubilee,

## Leviticus 25:55
for the Israelites belong to me as servants. They are my servants, whom I brought out of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.
