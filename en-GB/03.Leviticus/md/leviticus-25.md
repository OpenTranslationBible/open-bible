# Leviticus Chapter 25

## Leviticus 25:1
The Lord said to Moses at Mount Sinai,

## Leviticus 25:2
“Speak to the Israelites and say: When you enter the land I am giving you, the land itself must observe a Sabbath to the Lord.

## Leviticus 25:3
For six years sow your fields, prune your vineyards and gather your crops.

## Leviticus 25:4
But in the seventh year the land is to have a year of sabbath rest—a sabbath to the Lord. Do not sow or prune.

## Leviticus 25:5
Do not reap what grows by itself or gather the grapes of your untended vines. The land is to have a year of rest.

## Leviticus 25:6
Whatever the land yields during the sabbath year will be food for you—for yourself, your servants, your hired workers, and the temporary residents living among you.

## Leviticus 25:7
It will also be for your livestock and the wild animals.

## Leviticus 25:8
Count off seven sabbath years—seven times seven years—so that the seven sabbaths amount to forty-nine years.

## Leviticus 25:9
Then on the tenth day of the seventh month, the Day of Atonement, sound the trumpet throughout the land.

## Leviticus 25:10
Consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you.

## Leviticus 25:11
The fiftieth year shall be a jubilee; do not sow or reap.

## Leviticus 25:12
It is holy; eat only what grows of itself.

## Leviticus 25:13
In this Year of Jubilee everyone is to return to their own property.

## Leviticus 25:14
If you sell to your neighbour or buy from them, do not take advantage of one another.

## Leviticus 25:15
You are to buy from them based on the number of years since the Jubilee.

## Leviticus 25:16
Do not take advantage of one another, but fear your God. I am the Lord your God.

## Leviticus 25:17
Follow My decrees and be careful to obey My laws, and you will live safely in the land.

## Leviticus 25:18
Then the land will yield its fruit, and you will eat your fill and live there in safety.

## Leviticus 25:19
You may ask, ‘What will we eat in the seventh year if we do not sow or gather?’

## Leviticus 25:20
I will send My blessing in the sixth year, so that it will yield enough for three years.

## Leviticus 25:21
While you plant in the eighth year, you will eat from the old crop until the ninth year.

## Leviticus 25:22
The land must not be sold permanently, because it is Mine, and you reside as foreigners and strangers.

## Leviticus 25:23
Throughout the land you hold, you must provide for the redemption of the land.

## Leviticus 25:24
If one of your fellow Israelites becomes poor and sells some property, their nearest relative is to come and redeem it.

## Leviticus 25:25
If no one can redeem it but the seller prospers, they may buy it back.

## Leviticus 25:26
But if they do not acquire the means, it will remain with the buyer until the Jubilee.

## Leviticus 25:27
In the Jubilee it will be returned.

## Leviticus 25:54
Even if someone is not redeemed in any of these ways, they and their children are to be released in the Year of Jubilee.

## Leviticus 25:55
For the Israelites belong to Me as servants. I brought them out of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.
