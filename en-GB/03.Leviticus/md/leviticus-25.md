# Leviticus Chapter 25

## Leviticus 25:1

The Lord then spoke to Moses at Mount Sinai, saying,

## Leviticus 25:2

“Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When you come into the land which I am giving you, then the land shall have a sabbath to the Lord.

## Leviticus 25:3

For six years you shall sow your field, and for six years you shall prune your vineyard and gather in its yield.

## Leviticus 25:4

But in the seventh year the land shall have a sabbath rest, a sabbath to the Lord; you shall not sow your field nor prune your vineyard.

## Leviticus 25:5

You shall not reap your aftergrowth nor gather the grapes of your untrimmed vines; the land shall have a sabbatical year.

## Leviticus 25:6

All of you shall have the sabbath products of the land for food; yourself, your male and female slaves, your hired worker, and your resident foreigner, those who live as strangers among you.

## Leviticus 25:7

Even your cattle and the animals that are in your land shall have all its crops to eat.

## Leviticus 25:8

You are also to count off seven sabbaths of years for yourself, seven times seven years, so that you have the time of the seven sabbaths of years, namely, forty-nine years.

## Leviticus 25:9

You shall then sound a ram’s horn abroad on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the Day of Atonement you shall sound a horn all through your land.

## Leviticus 25:10

So you shall consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim a release throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you, and each of you shall return to his own property, and each of you shall return to his family.

## Leviticus 25:11

You shall have the fiftieth year as a jubilee; you shall not sow, nor reap its aftergrowth, nor gather from its untrimmed vines.

## Leviticus 25:12

For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy to you. You shall eat its produce from the field.

## Leviticus 25:13

On this year of jubilee, each of you shall return to his own property.

## Leviticus 25:14

Furthermore, if you make a sale to your neighbour, or buy from your neighbour’s hand, you shall not wrong one another.

## Leviticus 25:15

Corresponding to the number of years after the jubilee, you shall buy from your neighbour; he is to sell to you according to the number of years of crops.

## Leviticus 25:16

In proportion to a greater number of years you shall increase its price, and in proportion to fewer years you shall decrease its price, because it is a number of harvests he is selling to you.

## Leviticus 25:17

So you shall not wrong one another, but you shall fear your God; for I am the Lord your God.

## Leviticus 25:18

You shall therefore keep My statutes and keep My judgments so as to carry them out, so that you may live securely on the land.

## Leviticus 25:19

Then the land will yield its produce, so that you can eat your fill and live securely on it.

## Leviticus 25:20

But if you say, ‘What are we going to eat in the seventh year if we do not sow nor gather in our produce?’

## Leviticus 25:21

Then I will so order My blessing for you in the sixth year that it will bring forth the produce for three years.

## Leviticus 25:22

When you are sowing the eighth year, you can still eat old produce until the ninth year; until its produce comes in, you shall eat the old.

## Leviticus 25:23

The land, moreover, shall not be sold permanently, because the land is Mine; for you are only strangers and temporary residents with Me.

## Leviticus 25:24

So for every piece of your property, you are to provide for the redemption of the land.

## Leviticus 25:25

If a fellow countryman of yours becomes so poor that he sells part of his property, then his nearest relative is to come and redeem what his brother has sold.

## Leviticus 25:26

Or in case someone has no redeemer, but recovers and finds sufficient means to redeem it,

## Leviticus 25:27

Then he shall calculate the years since its sale and refund the balance to the person to whom he sold it, and so return to his property.

## Leviticus 25:28

But if he has not found sufficient means to get it back for himself, then what he has sold shall remain in the hands of its purchaser until the year of jubilee; but at the jubilee it shall revert, so that he may return to his property.

## Leviticus 25:29

Likewise, if a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city, then his redemption right remains valid until a full year has passed from its sale; his right of redemption lasts a year.

## Leviticus 25:30

But if it is not redeemed for him within a full year, then the house that is in the walled city passes permanently to its purchaser throughout his generations; it does not revert in the jubilee.

## Leviticus 25:31

The houses of the villages, however, which have no surrounding wall, shall be considered as open fields; they have the right of redemption and revert in the jubilee.

## Leviticus 25:32

As for cities of the Levites, the Levites have a permanent right of redemption for the houses of the cities which are their possession.

## Leviticus 25:33

What, therefore, belongs to the Levites may be redeemed, and a house sold in the city of their possession reverts in the jubilee, because the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the sons of Israel.

## Leviticus 25:34

But pasture fields of their cities shall not be sold, for that is their permanent possession.

## Leviticus 25:35

Now in case a countryman of yours becomes poor and his means falter with regard to you, then you are to sustain him, like a stranger or a temporary resident, so that he may live with you.

## Leviticus 25:36

Do not take any kind of interest from him, but fear your God, so that your countryman may live with you.

## Leviticus 25:37

You shall not give him your silver at interest, nor your food for profit.

## Leviticus 25:38

I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.

## Leviticus 25:39

Now if a countryman of yours becomes so poor with regard to you that he sells himself to you, you shall not subject him to a slave’s service.

## Leviticus 25:40

He shall be with you as a hired worker, as if he were a temporary resident; he shall serve with you until the year of jubilee.

## Leviticus 25:41

He shall then leave you, he and his sons with him, and go back to his family, so that he may return to the property of his forefathers.

## Leviticus 25:42

For they are My servants whom I brought out from the land of Egypt; they are not to be sold in a slave sale.

## Leviticus 25:43

You shall not rule over him with severity, but are to revere your God.

## Leviticus 25:44

As for your male and female slaves whom you may have—you may acquire male and female slaves from the nations that are around you.

## Leviticus 25:45

You may also acquire them from the sons of the foreigners who reside among you, and from their families who are with you, whom they have fathered in your land; they may also become your possession.

## Leviticus 25:46

You may give them as an inheritance to your sons after you, to receive as a possession; you can use them as permanent slaves. But in respect to your fellow Israelites, you shall not rule with severity over one another.

## Leviticus 25:47

Now if the means of a stranger or of a temporary resident with you becomes sufficient, and a countryman of yours becomes so poor with regard to him as to sell himself to a stranger who is residing with you, or to the descendants of a stranger’s family,

## Leviticus 25:48

Then he shall have redemption right after he has sold himself. One of his brothers may redeem him,

## Leviticus 25:49

Or his uncle, or his uncle’s son may redeem him, or one of his blood relatives from his family may redeem him; or if he prospers, he may redeem himself.

## Leviticus 25:50

He then with his purchaser shall calculate from the year when he sold himself to him up to the year of jubilee; and the price of his sale shall correspond to the number of years. It shall be like the days of a hired worker with him.

## Leviticus 25:51

If there are still many years, he shall refund part of his purchase price in proportion to them for his own redemption;

## Leviticus 25:52

But if only a few years remain until the year of jubilee, he shall so calculate with him. In proportion to the years that remain, he is to refund the amount for his redemption.

## Leviticus 25:53

He shall be with him like a worker hired year by year; he shall not rule with severity over him in your sight.

## Leviticus 25:54

Even if he is not redeemed by these means, he shall still leave in the year of jubilee, he and his sons with him.

## Leviticus 25:55

For the sons of Israel are My servants; they are My servants whom I brought out from the land of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.
