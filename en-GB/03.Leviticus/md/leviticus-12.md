# Leviticus Chapter 12

## Leviticus 12:1

The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying,

## Leviticus 12:2

“Speak to the Israelites: ‘When a woman becomes pregnant and gives birth to a male child, she shall be ceremonially unclean for seven days, as she is during her menstrual period.

## Leviticus 12:3

On the eighth day, the boy's foreskin shall be circumcised.

## Leviticus 12:4

She must then remain in the state of blood purification for thirty-three days. She shall not touch any sacred thing or enter the sanctuary until the days of her purification are fulfilled.

## Leviticus 12:5

If she gives birth to a female child, she will be unclean for two weeks, as during her menstrual period. She must then remain in the state of blood purification for sixty-six days.

## Leviticus 12:6

‘When the days of her purification for a son or daughter are completed, she shall bring to the priest at the entrance of the tent of meeting a year-old lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or a turtledove for a sin offering.

## Leviticus 12:7

The priest shall offer them before the Lord to make atonement for her, and she shall be cleansed from the flow of her blood. These are the regulations for the woman who gives birth to a male or female child.

## Leviticus 12:8

If she cannot afford a lamb, she shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering. In this way, the priest will make atonement for her, and she will be clean.’”
