# Leviticus Chapter 11

## Leviticus 11:1
The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying to them,

## Leviticus 11:2
“Speak to the Israelites and say: ‘Among all the animals that live on land, these are the ones you may eat:

## Leviticus 11:3
You may eat any animal that has a split hoof completely divided and that chews the cud.

## Leviticus 11:4
“‘However, there are some that only chew the cud or only have a split hoof, but you must not eat them. The camel, although it chews the cud, does not have a split hoof; it is unclean for you.

## Leviticus 11:5
The hyrax, though it chews the cud, does not have a split hoof; it is unclean for you.

## Leviticus 11:6
The rabbit, although it chews the cud, does not have a split hoof; it is unclean for you.

## Leviticus 11:7
And the pig, though it has a split hoof completely divided, does not chew the cud; it is unclean for you.

## Leviticus 11:8
You are not to consume their meat or handle their carcasses; they are considered unclean for you.

## Leviticus 11:9
“‘Of all the creatures living in the water, you may eat any that have fins and scales.

## Leviticus 11:10
But all creatures in the seas or rivers that do not have fins and scales—among all the swarming things or other living creatures in the water—are detestable to you.

## Leviticus 11:11
And since they are detestable to you, you must not eat their meat and you must regard their carcasses as detestable.

## Leviticus 11:12
Anything living in the water that does not have fins and scales is to be regarded as detestable by you.

## Leviticus 11:13
“‘These are the birds you are to regard as detestable and not eat because they are detestable: the eagle, the vulture, and the buzzard,

## Leviticus 11:14
the red kite, any kind of falcon,

## Leviticus 11:15
every kind of raven,

## Leviticus 11:16
the ostrich, the owl, the seagull, and any kind of hawk,

## Leviticus 11:17
the small owl, the cormorant, and the large owl,

## Leviticus 11:18
the barn owl, the pelican, and the carrion vulture,

## Leviticus 11:19
the stork, any kind of heron, the hoopoe, and the bat.

## Leviticus 11:20
“‘All flying insects that walk on all fours are to be regarded as detestable by you.

## Leviticus 11:21
However, among the flying insects that walk on all fours you may eat those that have jointed legs for hopping on the ground.

## Leviticus 11:22
Of these, you are permitted to eat any kind of locust, katydid, cricket, or grasshopper.

## Leviticus 11:23
But all other flying insects that have four legs are to be regarded as detestable.

## Leviticus 11:24
“‘You will become unclean by these; whoever touches their carcasses will be unclean until evening.

## Leviticus 11:25
Whoever picks up one of their carcasses must wash their clothes, and they will be unclean until evening.

## Leviticus 11:26
“‘Every animal that does not have a split hoof completely divided or that does not chew the cud is unclean for you; whoever touches the carcass of any of them will be unclean.

## Leviticus 11:27
Of all the animals that walk on all fours, those that walk on their paws are unclean for you; whoever touches their carcasses will be unclean until evening.

## Leviticus 11:28
Anyone who picks up their carcasses must wash their clothes, and they will be unclean until evening. These animals are unclean for you.

## Leviticus 11:29
“‘Of the animals that move along the ground, these are unclean for you: the mole, the mouse, and any kind of great lizard,

## Leviticus 11:30
the gecko, the crocodile, the lizard, the sand reptile, and the chameleon.

## Leviticus 11:31
Of all those that move along the ground, these are unclean for you. Whoever touches them when they are dead will be unclean until evening.

## Leviticus 11:32
When one of them dies and falls on something, that article, whatever its use, will be unclean, whether it is made of wood, cloth, hide, or sackcloth. It must be put in water; it will be unclean until evening, and then it will be clean.

## Leviticus 11:33
If one of them falls into a clay pot, everything in it will be unclean, and the pot must be broken.

## Leviticus 11:34
Any food you are allowed to eat that has come into contact with water from any such pot is unclean, and any liquid that is drunk from such a pot is unclean.

## Leviticus 11:35
Anything that one of their carcasses falls on becomes unclean; an oven or cooking pot must be broken up. They are unclean, and you are to regard them as unclean.

## Leviticus 11:36
A spring, however, or a cistern for collecting water remains clean, but anyone who touches one of these carcasses is unclean.

## Leviticus 11:37
If a carcass falls on any seeds that are to be planted, they remain clean.

## Leviticus 11:38
But if water has been put on the seed and a carcass falls on it, it becomes unclean for you.

## Leviticus 11:39
“‘If an animal that you are allowed to eat dies, anyone who touches its carcass will be unclean until evening.

## Leviticus 11:40
Anyone who eats some of its carcass must wash their clothes, and they will be unclean until evening. Anyone who picks up the carcass must wash their clothes, and they will be unclean until evening.

## Leviticus 11:41
“‘Every creature that moves along the ground is to be regarded as detestable; it is not to be eaten.

## Leviticus 11:42
You are not to eat any creature that moves along the ground, whether it moves on its belly or walks on all fours or on many feet; it is detestable.

## Leviticus 11:43
Do not make yourselves impure by any of these creatures. Do not make yourselves unclean by means of them or be made unclean by them.

## Leviticus 11:44
I am the Lord your God; set yourselves apart and be holy, because I am holy. Do not make yourselves unclean by any creature that moves along the ground.

## Leviticus 11:45
I am the Lord, who brought you up out of Egypt to be your God; therefore be holy, because I am holy.

## Leviticus 11:46
“‘These are the regulations concerning animals, birds, every living thing that moves about in the water, and every creature that moves along the ground.

## Leviticus 11:47
You must distinguish between the unclean and the clean, between living creatures that may be eaten and those that may not be eaten.’”
