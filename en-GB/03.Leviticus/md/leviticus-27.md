# Leviticus Chapter 27

## Leviticus 27:1
The Lord spoke to Moses again, saying,

## Leviticus 27:2
“Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘When someone makes a special vow to dedicate a person to the Lord, they shall be valued according to your assessment.

## Leviticus 27:3
If the assessment is for a male between the ages of twenty and sixty, the value shall be fifty shekels of silver, by the sanctuary shekel.

## Leviticus 27:4
If it is for a female, then the value shall be thirty shekels.

## Leviticus 27:5
For a person between five and twenty years old, the value for a male shall be twenty shekels, and for a female, ten shekels.

## Leviticus 27:6
For a person from one month to five years old, the value shall be five shekels of silver for a male, and three shekels of silver for a female.

## Leviticus 27:7
For a person sixty years old or more, if a male, the value shall be fifteen shekels, and for a female, ten shekels.

## Leviticus 27:8
If the one making the vow is too poor to pay the specified amount, they shall be presented to the priest, who will assess them according to what they can afford.

## Leviticus 27:9
“‘If what is vowed is an animal that can be offered to the Lord, it shall be considered holy.

## Leviticus 27:10
They must not exchange or substitute it, good for bad or bad for good; if they do substitute one animal for another, both the original and the substitute shall become holy.

## Leviticus 27:11
If the vowed animal is ceremonially unclean and not acceptable as an offering to the Lord, it must be presented to the priest.

## Leviticus 27:12
The priest will assess its quality, whether good or bad; whatever value the priest sets, that is what it shall be.

## Leviticus 27:13
If the owner wishes to redeem the animal, they must add a fifth to its value.

## Leviticus 27:14
“‘If someone dedicates their house as holy to the Lord, the priest will assess its quality, whether good or bad. The value set by the priest shall stand.

## Leviticus 27:15
If the one who dedicates the house wishes to redeem it, they must add a fifth to its value, and it will become theirs again.

## Leviticus 27:16
“‘If someone dedicates part of their family land to the Lord, its value shall be set according to the amount of seed required for it—fifty shekels of silver to a homer of barley seed.

## Leviticus 27:17
If they dedicate the field during the Year of Jubilee, the value set shall remain.

## Leviticus 27:18
If they dedicate the field after the Jubilee, the priest will calculate the value according to the number of years remaining until the next Jubilee, and the value will be reduced.

## Leviticus 27:19
If the one who dedicates the field wishes to redeem it, they must add a fifth to its value, and it will become theirs again.

## Leviticus 27:20
If they do not redeem the field, or if it has been sold to someone else, it cannot be redeemed.

## Leviticus 27:21
When the field is released in the Jubilee, it shall be holy to the Lord, like a field devoted to Him; it shall become the property of the priest.

## Leviticus 27:22
“‘If someone dedicates to the Lord a field they have bought, which is not part of their family land,

## Leviticus 27:23
the priest will assess its value up to the Year of Jubilee, and the owner must pay the value on that day as something holy to the Lord.

## Leviticus 27:24
In the Year of Jubilee, the field shall return to the person from whom it was bought, to whom the land originally belonged.

## Leviticus 27:25
Every value shall be set according to the sanctuary shekel, which consists of twenty gerahs.

## Leviticus 27:26
“‘No one may dedicate the firstborn of an animal, since the firstborn already belongs to the Lord; whether ox or sheep, it is the Lord’s.

## Leviticus 27:27
If it is one of the unclean animals, it may be redeemed at its set value plus a fifth; if not redeemed, it shall be sold at its set value.

## Leviticus 27:28
“‘Nothing that a person owns and devotes to the Lord—whether human, animal, or family land—may be sold or redeemed; everything so devoted is most holy to the Lord.

## Leviticus 27:29
No person who is devoted to destruction may be ransomed; they must be put to death.

## Leviticus 27:30
“‘A tenth of all produce from the land, whether grain from the soil or fruit from the trees, is consecrated to the Lord; it is holy to Him.

## Leviticus 27:31
If anyone wishes to redeem any of their tithe, they must add a fifth to its value.

## Leviticus 27:32
Every tenth animal of the herd and flock, whatever passes under the shepherd’s rod, shall be holy to the Lord.

## Leviticus 27:33
No one may choose between good and bad or make any substitution. If a substitution is made, both the original and the substitute shall become holy and cannot be redeemed.’”

## Leviticus 27:34
These are the instructions the Lord provided to Moses for the Israelites on Mount Sinai.
