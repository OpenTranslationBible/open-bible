# Leviticus Chapter 27

## Leviticus 27:1
The Lord said to Moses,

## Leviticus 27:2
“Speak to the Israelites and say: When anyone makes a special vow to dedicate a person to the Lord by a certain value,

## Leviticus 27:3
the value of a male between the ages of twenty and sixty shall be fifty shekels of silver.

## Leviticus 27:4
For a female, the value shall be thirty shekels.

## Leviticus 27:5
A male aged five to twenty is valued at twenty shekels; a female at ten.

## Leviticus 27:6
A male aged one month to five years is five shekels; a female is three.

## Leviticus 27:7
A male over sixty is fifteen shekels; a female is ten.

## Leviticus 27:8
If anyone is too poor to pay the set value, they must present themselves to the priest, who will set a value based on what the person can afford.

## Leviticus 27:9
If what is vowed is an animal acceptable as an offering, it becomes holy.

## Leviticus 27:10
They must not exchange it or substitute it.

## Leviticus 27:11
If the vowed animal is unclean, the priest will set its value.

## Leviticus 27:12
Whether high or low, whatever value the priest sets will stand.

## Leviticus 27:13
If the owner wants to redeem it, a fifth must be added.

## Leviticus 27:14
If someone dedicates their house, the priest will determine its value.

## Leviticus 27:15
If the one who dedicates it wants to redeem it, a fifth must be added.

## Leviticus 27:16
If a person dedicates part of their land, its value is calculated by the amount of seed needed to sow it.

## Leviticus 27:17
If the dedication is made in the Year of Jubilee, the full value stands.

## Leviticus 27:18
If after the Jubilee, the value is reduced according to the remaining years.

## Leviticus 27:19
If the one who dedicated the field wants to redeem it, a fifth must be added.

## Leviticus 27:20
If not redeemed and sold to someone else, it can never be bought back.

## Leviticus 27:21
When the field is released in the Jubilee, it becomes holy, like a devoted field, belonging to the priests.

## Leviticus 27:22
If someone dedicates a field they bought—not part of their inheritance—

## Leviticus 27:23
the priest shall determine its value up to the Year of Jubilee.

## Leviticus 27:24
In the Jubilee year, the field returns to the original owner.

## Leviticus 27:25
Every value must be set according to the sanctuary shekel.

## Leviticus 27:26
No one may dedicate the firstborn of an animal, since it already belongs to the Lord.

## Leviticus 27:27
If it is an unclean animal, it may be redeemed with a fifth added, or it must be sold.

## Leviticus 27:28
But nothing that a person devotes to the Lord—whether human, animal or land—may be sold or redeemed; it is most holy.

## Leviticus 27:29
No one devoted to destruction may be ransomed; they must be put to death.

## Leviticus 27:30
A tithe of everything from the land belongs to the Lord.

## Leviticus 27:31
If someone wishes to redeem part of their tithe, they must add a fifth.

## Leviticus 27:32
Every tenth animal that passes under the shepherd’s rod is holy to the Lord.

## Leviticus 27:33
They must not pick out the good from the bad or make a substitution.

## Leviticus 27:34
These are the commands the Lord gave to Moses on Mount Sinai for the Israelites.
