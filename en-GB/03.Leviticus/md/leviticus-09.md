# Leviticus Chapter 9

## Leviticus 9:1

On the eighth day, Moses called for Aaron and his sons, as well as the elders of Israel.

## Leviticus 9:2

He instructed Aaron, “Take a calf, a bull, for your sin offering and a ram for your burnt offering, both without defect, and present them before the Lord.

## Leviticus 9:3

Then speak to the Israelites, saying, ‘Take a male goat for a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb, both one year old and without defect, for a burnt offering,

## Leviticus 9:4

and an ox and a ram for peace offerings to sacrifice before the Lord, along with a grain offering mixed with olive oil; for today the Lord will appear to you.’”

## Leviticus 9:5

They brought what Moses had commanded to the front of the tent of meeting, and the whole assembly came near and stood before the Lord.

## Leviticus 9:6

Moses explained, “This is the command of the Lord, so that His glory may be revealed to you.”

## Leviticus 9:7

Moses said to Aaron, “Come to the altar and offer your sin offering and your burnt offering to make atonement for yourself and the people; then make the offering for the people to make atonement for them, as the Lord has commanded.”

## Leviticus 9:8

Aaron approached the altar and slaughtered the calf for the sin offering for himself.

## Leviticus 9:9

His sons presented the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood and put it on the horns of the altar, pouring out the rest at the base of the altar.

## Leviticus 9:10

He burned the fat, kidneys, and the long lobe of the liver from the sin offering on the altar, as the Lord commanded Moses.

## Leviticus 9:11

He took the flesh and the hide outside the camp and burned it.

## Leviticus 9:12

He then slaughtered the burnt offering, and his sons handed him the blood, which he sprinkled around the altar.

## Leviticus 9:13

They handed him the burnt offering in pieces, including the head, and he burned them on the altar.

## Leviticus 9:14

He washed the internal organs and the legs and offered them on top of the burnt offering on the altar.

## Leviticus 9:15

Aaron then presented the people’s offering. He took the goat for the people’s sin offering, slaughtered it, and offered it as a sin offering like the first one.

## Leviticus 9:16

He presented the burnt offering and offered it according to the ordinance.

## Leviticus 9:17

He also presented the grain offering, took a handful of it, and burned it on the altar in addition to the morning’s burnt offering.

## Leviticus 9:18

He slaughtered the ox and the ram as the peace offerings for the people. His sons handed him the blood, and he sprinkled it around the altar.

## Leviticus 9:19

The fat portions from the ox and the ram—the fat tail, the layer of fat, the kidneys, and the long lobe of the liver—

## Leviticus 9:20

these they placed on the breasts, and Aaron burned the fat on the altar.

## Leviticus 9:21

Aaron waved the breasts and the right thigh as a wave offering before the Lord, as Moses had commanded.

## Leviticus 9:22

Aaron lifted his hands towards the people and blessed them. After making the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, he stepped down.

## Leviticus 9:23

Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting. When they came out, they blessed the people, and the glory of the Lord appeared to all the people.

## Leviticus 9:24

Fire came out from the presence of the Lord and consumed the burnt offering and the fat portions on the altar. When all the people saw it, they shouted and fell face down.
