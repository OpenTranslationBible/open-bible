# Leviticus Chapter 17

## Leviticus 17:1
The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,

## Leviticus 17:2
“Speak to Aaron, his sons, and all the Israelites, and say to them: ‘This is what the Lord has commanded:

## Leviticus 17:3
Any member of the house of Israel who sacrifices an ox, a lamb, or a goat in the camp, or outside of it,

## Leviticus 17:4
and does not bring it to the entrance of the tent of meeting to offer it to the Lord in front of the tabernacle, shall be guilty of shedding blood. That person has shed blood and must be cut off from their people.

## Leviticus 17:5
This is so the Israelites will bring their sacrifices, which they are currently offering in the open fields, to the Lord at the entrance to the tent of meeting, to the priest, and offer them as fellowship offerings.

## Leviticus 17:6
The priest shall sprinkle the blood on the altar of the Lord at the entrance to the tent of meeting, and burn the fat as a pleasing aroma to the Lord.

## Leviticus 17:7
They must no longer offer their sacrifices to the goat demons, with whom they have been unfaithful. This is to be a lasting ordinance for them and for future generations.’

## Leviticus 17:8
“Tell them: ‘Any Israelite or any foreigner living among them who presents a burnt offering or sacrifice

## Leviticus 17:9
and does not bring it to the entrance of the tent of meeting to offer it to the Lord must be cut off from their people.

## Leviticus 17:10
I will set my face against any Israelite or any foreigner residing among them who consumes any blood, and I will cut them off from their people.

## Leviticus 17:11
For the life of a creature is in the blood, and I have given it to you to make atonement for your souls on the altar; it is the blood that makes atonement for one's life.

## Leviticus 17:12
Therefore I say to the Israelites: “None of you may consume blood, nor may any foreigner residing among you consume blood.”

## Leviticus 17:13
Any Israelite or any foreigner residing among you who hunts any animal or bird that may be eaten must drain out its blood and cover it with earth,

## Leviticus 17:14
because the life of every creature is in its blood. That is why I have said to the Israelites: “You must not consume the blood of any creature, because the life of every creature is its blood; anyone who consumes it must be cut off.”

## Leviticus 17:15
Anyone, whether native-born or foreigner, who eats anything found dead or torn by wild animals must wash their clothes and bathe with water, and they will remain ceremonially unclean until evening; then they will be clean.

## Leviticus 17:16
But if they do not wash their clothes and bathe themselves, they will bear the responsibility for their guilt.
