# Leviticus Chapter 17

## Leviticus 17:1
The Lord said to Moses,

## Leviticus 17:2
â€œSpeak to Aaron and his sons and all the Israelites and say to them: This is what the Lord has commanded:

## Leviticus 17:3
Any Israelite who sacrifices an ox, lamb, or goat in the camp or outside of it,

## Leviticus 17:4
instead of bringing it to the entrance of the tent of meeting to offer it to the Lord, is guilty of bloodshed. That person must be cut off.

## Leviticus 17:5
This is so that the Israelites will bring their sacrifices to the Lord at the entrance to the tent of meeting, instead of offering them in the open fields.

## Leviticus 17:6
The priest shall splash the blood against the altar and burn the fat as a pleasing aroma to the Lord.

## Leviticus 17:7
They must no longer offer sacrifices to goat idols. This is a lasting ordinance.

## Leviticus 17:8
Say to them: Any Israelite or foreigner who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice

## Leviticus 17:9
and does not bring it to the tent of meeting must be cut off from the people.

## Leviticus 17:10
Any Israelite or foreigner who eats blood, I will set My face against them and cut them off.

## Leviticus 17:11
For the life of a creature is in the blood, and I have given it to make atonement for your lives.

## Leviticus 17:12
That is why none of you may eat blood, and no foreigner among you may eat blood.

## Leviticus 17:13
Any Israelite or foreigner who hunts an animal or bird for food must drain its blood and cover it with earth.

## Leviticus 17:14
Because the life of every creature is its blood. Anyone who eats it must be cut off.

## Leviticus 17:15
Anyone who eats an animal found dead or torn by wild animals must wash their clothes and bathe, and they will be unclean until evening.

## Leviticus 17:16
If they do not wash or bathe, they will be held responsible.
