# Leviticus Chapter 10

## Leviticus 10:1
Nadab and Abihu, sons of Aaron, each took their own censers, placed fire in them, and added incense. They offered unauthorised fire before the Lord, which He had not commanded them.

## Leviticus 10:2
Fire came forth from the presence of the Lord and consumed them, and they died before the Lord.

## Leviticus 10:3
Moses said to Aaron, “This is what the Lord spoke of, saying: ‘Among those who draw near to Me, I will be shown to be holy; in the presence of all the people, I will be honoured.’” So Aaron remained silent.

## Leviticus 10:4
Moses called upon Mishael and Elzaphan, sons of Aaron’s uncle Uzziel, and instructed them, “Come forward and carry your relatives away from the front of the sanctuary to a place outside the camp.”

## Leviticus 10:5
They came forward and carried them, still in their tunics, to an area outside the camp, as Moses had directed.

## Leviticus 10:6
Moses said to Aaron and his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, “Do not let your hair become unkempt, nor tear your clothes, lest you die and wrath come upon the whole community. But your kin, the entire house of Israel, may mourn for those the Lord has consumed by fire.

## Leviticus 10:7
Do not leave the entrance of the tent of meeting, or you will die, for the Lord’s anointing oil is upon you.” So they did according to Moses’ instructions.

## Leviticus 10:8
The Lord addressed Aaron, saying,

## Leviticus 10:9
“You and your sons must not drink wine or other fermented drink when you enter the tent of meeting, lest you die. This is a perpetual statute for your generations,

## Leviticus 10:10
to distinguish between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean,

## Leviticus 10:11
and so you may teach the Israelites all the decrees the Lord has given through Moses.”

## Leviticus 10:12
Moses spoke to Aaron and his remaining sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, saying, “Take the grain offering left from the Lord’s offerings by fire and eat it as unleavened bread beside the altar, for it is most holy.

## Leviticus 10:13
You shall eat it in a holy place, for it is your portion and your sons’ portion from the offerings made by fire to the Lord, as I have been commanded.

## Leviticus 10:14
The breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the offering you may eat in a clean place, you, your sons, and your daughters with you; for they have been given as your allotted share and your children’s share from the peace offerings of the Israelites.

## Leviticus 10:15
They shall bring the thigh that is lifted up and the breast that is waved, along with the offerings by fire of the fat portions, to present as a wave offering before the Lord; it shall be a perpetual due for you and your sons with you, as the Lord has commanded.”

## Leviticus 10:16
Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering and found it had been burned. He was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron’s remaining sons, and said,

## Leviticus 10:17
“Why did you not eat the sin offering in the sanctuary area? It is most holy, and it was given to you to take away the guilt of the congregation by making atonement for them before the Lord.

## Leviticus 10:18
Since its blood was not brought into the sanctuary, you should have eaten it in the sanctuary area, as I commanded.”

## Leviticus 10:19
Aaron replied to Moses, “Today they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the Lord, and such things as these have happened to me. If I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been pleasing in the Lord’s sight?”

## Leviticus 10:20
When Moses heard this, he was content.
