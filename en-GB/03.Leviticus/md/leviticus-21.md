# Leviticus Chapter 21

## Leviticus 21:1

The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying, “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and declare to them: ‘A priest must not defile himself for any deceased person among his people,

## Leviticus 21:2

except for his closest relatives, such as his mother, father, son, daughter, or brother,

## Leviticus 21:3

and also for his virgin sister who is dependent on him, as she has no husband; for her, he may defile himself.

## Leviticus 21:4

He must not defile himself for those related by marriage, thus profaning himself.

## Leviticus 21:5

Priests must not make bald spots on their heads, shave off the edges of their beards, or make any cuts on their bodies.

## Leviticus 21:6

They must be holy to their God and not profane the name of their God, for they present the offerings by fire to the Lord, the food of their God; thus, they must be holy.

## Leviticus 21:7

They must not marry a woman who is a prostitute or has been profaned, nor shall they marry a woman divorced from her husband, for they are holy to their God.

## Leviticus 21:8

Therefore, regard them as holy, because they offer the food of your God. They shall be holy to you, for I, the Lord, who sanctifies you, am holy.

## Leviticus 21:9

If a priest’s daughter defiles herself by becoming a prostitute, she brings disgrace upon her father; she must be burned with fire.

## Leviticus 21:10

The high priest, the one among his brothers upon whose head the anointing oil has been poured and who has been consecrated to wear the garments, must not let his hair become unkempt or tear his clothes.

## Leviticus 21:11

He must not approach any dead body, nor defile himself, even for his father or mother,

## Leviticus 21:12

nor leave the sanctuary of his God or desecrate it, for the consecration of the anointing oil of his God is upon him. I am the Lord.

## Leviticus 21:13

He must marry a woman in her virginity.

## Leviticus 21:14

He must not marry a widow, a divorced woman, or a woman defiled by prostitution, but he must take a virgin from his own people,

## Leviticus 21:15

so that he does not profane his offspring among his people. I am the Lord, who sanctifies him.’”

## Leviticus 21:16

The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying,

## Leviticus 21:17

“Speak to Aaron, saying: ‘None of your descendants throughout their generations who has a defect may approach to offer the food of his God.

## Leviticus 21:18

No man who has any defect may approach: no man who is blind, or lame, or has a disfigured face, or any conspicuous deformity,

## Leviticus 21:19

or anyone with a broken foot or hand,

## Leviticus 21:20

or who is a hunchback or a dwarf, or who has a defect in his eye, or has festering sores, scabs, or crushed testicles.

## Leviticus 21:21

No descendant of Aaron the priest who has any defect is to come near to present the offerings by fire to the Lord. He has a defect; he must not come near to offer the food of his God.

## Leviticus 21:22

He is permitted to partake of the food of his God, including both the most sacred and the holy portions,

## Leviticus 21:23

but because of his defect, he must not approach the veil or come near the altar, lest he profane my sanctuaries. I am the Lord, who sanctifies them.’”

## Leviticus 21:24

Moses then communicated these instructions to Aaron, his sons, and all the Israelites.
