# Leviticus Chapter 21

## Leviticus 21:1
The Lord said to Moses: “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron. No one is to make himself ceremonially unclean for a dead person among his people,

## Leviticus 21:2
except for a close relative—mother, father, son, daughter, or brother.

## Leviticus 21:3
He may also make himself unclean for an unmarried sister who depends on him.

## Leviticus 21:4
But he must not make himself unclean for someone who is only a relative by marriage.

## Leviticus 21:5
Priests must not shave their heads, trim the edges of their beards, or cut their bodies.

## Leviticus 21:6
They must be holy to their God and not profane His name.

## Leviticus 21:7
They must not marry women who are defiled by prostitution or divorced from their husbands.

## Leviticus 21:8
Set them apart as holy, because they offer the food of your God.

## Leviticus 21:9
If a priest’s daughter becomes a prostitute, she disgraces her father. She must be burned in fire.

## Leviticus 21:10
The high priest, who has had the anointing oil poured on him and been consecrated to wear the garments, must not let his hair become unkempt or tear his clothes.

## Leviticus 21:11
He must not enter a place where there is a dead body, or make himself unclean, even for a close relative.

## Leviticus 21:12
He must not leave the sanctuary or desecrate it, for he is consecrated.

## Leviticus 21:13
He must marry a virgin.

## Leviticus 21:14
He must not marry a widow, a divorced woman, or a prostitute.

## Leviticus 21:15
He must not defile his offspring among his people.

## Leviticus 21:16
The Lord said to Moses:

## Leviticus 21:17
“Say to Aaron: No man with a defect is to come near to present food offerings.

## Leviticus 21:18
No one who is blind, lame, disfigured or deformed,

## Leviticus 21:19
no one with a crippled foot or hand,

## Leviticus 21:20
or who is hunchbacked, a dwarf, or who has an eye defect, skin disease or damaged testicles.

## Leviticus 21:21
No descendant of Aaron with a defect is to approach to offer food offerings.

## Leviticus 21:22
He may eat the holy food, but must not come near the curtain or altar.

## Leviticus 21:23
He must not desecrate the sanctuary.

## Leviticus 21:24
So Moses told this to Aaron, his sons, and all the Israelites.
