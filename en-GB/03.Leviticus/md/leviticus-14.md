# Leviticus Chapter 14

## Leviticus 14:1
The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,

## Leviticus 14:2
“This is the law for the person with a skin disease on the day of their purification. They shall be brought to the priest;

## Leviticus 14:3
and the priest shall go outside the camp to inspect them. If the person has been healed of the defiling skin disease,

## Leviticus 14:4
the priest shall command that two live clean birds, cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop be brought for the one to be cleansed.

## Leviticus 14:5
The priest shall order that one of the birds be slaughtered in a clay vessel over running water.

## Leviticus 14:6
He shall then take the live bird along with the cedar wood, the scarlet yarn, and the hyssop, and dip them into the blood of the bird that was killed over the running water.

## Leviticus 14:7
He shall sprinkle the one to be cleansed from the skin disease seven times and pronounce them clean, and release the live bird into the open fields.

## Leviticus 14:8
The person to be cleansed must wash their clothes, shave off all their hair, and bathe in water, and they will be clean. Afterwards, they may enter the camp but must remain outside their tent for seven days.

## Leviticus 14:9
On the seventh day, they must shave off all their hair: head, beard, eyebrows, and all other hair. They must wash their clothes and bathe themselves in water, and they will be clean.

## Leviticus 14:10
On the eighth day, they must take two male lambs without defect, a year-old ewe lamb without defect, and three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, and one log of oil.

## Leviticus 14:11
The priest who pronounces them clean shall present the person to be cleansed and their offerings before the Lord at the entrance of the tent of meeting.

## Leviticus 14:12
The priest shall take one male lamb and offer it as a guilt offering, along with the log of oil, and wave them as a wave offering before the Lord.

## Leviticus 14:13
He shall slaughter the lamb in the place where the sin offering and burnt offering are slaughtered, in the sanctuary area. The guilt offering, like the sin offering, belongs to the priest; it is most holy.

## Leviticus 14:14
The priest shall take some of the blood of the guilt offering and put it on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of their right hand, and on the big toe of their right foot.

## Leviticus 14:15
The priest shall also take some of the log of oil and pour it into the palm of his left hand.

## Leviticus 14:16
He shall dip his right forefinger into the oil in his palm and sprinkle some of the oil with his finger seven times before the Lord.

## Leviticus 14:17
Some of the remaining oil in his palm the priest shall put on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of their right hand, and on the big toe of their right foot, on top of the blood of the guilt offering.

## Leviticus 14:18
The rest of the oil in his palm the priest shall put on the head of the one to be cleansed and make atonement for them before the Lord.

## Leviticus 14:19
Then the priest shall offer the sin offering and make atonement for the one to be cleansed from their uncleanness. After that, he shall slaughter the burnt offering.

## Leviticus 14:20
The priest shall offer the burnt offering and the grain offering on the altar. In this way, the priest shall make atonement for them, and they will be clean.

## Leviticus 14:21
If, however, they are poor and cannot afford these, they must take one male lamb as a guilt offering to be waved to make atonement for them, together with a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering, and a log of oil,

## Leviticus 14:22
and two turtledoves or two young pigeons, whichever they can afford, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering.

## Leviticus 14:23
On the eighth day, they must bring them for their cleansing to the priest at the entrance of the tent of meeting, before the Lord.

## Leviticus 14:24
The priest shall take the lamb for the guilt offering, together with the log of oil, and wave them as a wave offering before the Lord.

## Leviticus 14:25
He shall slaughter the lamb for the guilt offering and take some of its blood and put it on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of their right hand, and on the big toe of their right foot.

## Leviticus 14:26
The priest shall pour some of the oil into the palm of his left hand.

## Leviticus 14:27
With his right forefinger, the priest shall sprinkle some of the oil from his palm seven times before the Lord.

## Leviticus 14:28
Some of the oil in his palm he shall put on the same places he put the blood of the guilt offering—on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, on the thumb of their right hand, and on the big toe of their right foot.

## Leviticus 14:29
The rest of the oil in his palm the priest shall put on the head of the one to be cleansed, to make atonement for them before the Lord.

## Leviticus 14:30
He shall then offer one of the turtledoves or young pigeons, whichever they can afford.

## Leviticus 14:31
He shall offer what they can afford, one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, along with the grain offering. Thus the priest shall make atonement before the Lord on behalf of the one to be cleansed.

## Leviticus 14:32
This is the law for anyone who has a defiling skin disease and cannot afford the regular offerings for their cleansing.

## Leviticus 14:33
The Lord also spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:

## Leviticus 14:34
“When you enter the land of Canaan, which I am giving you as your possession, and I put a spreading mould in a house in that land,

## Leviticus 14:35
the owner of the house must go and tell the priest, ‘I have seen something that looks like a defiling mould in my house.’

## Leviticus 14:36
The priest shall command that the house be emptied before he goes in to examine the mould, so that nothing in the house will be pronounced unclean. After this, the priest shall go in to inspect the house.

## Leviticus 14:37
He shall examine the mould on the walls, and if it has greenish or reddish depressions that appear deeper than the surface of the wall,

## Leviticus 14:38
the priest shall go out of the house and close it up for seven days.

## Leviticus 14:39
On the seventh day, the priest shall return to inspect the house. If the mould has spread on the walls,

## Leviticus 14:40
he shall order that the contaminated stones be torn out and thrown into an unclean place outside the town.

## Leviticus 14:41
He must have all the inside walls of the house scraped, and the material that is scraped off dumped into an unclean place outside the town.

## Leviticus 14:42
Then they shall take other stones to replace these and take new clay and plaster the house.

## Leviticus 14:43
If the defiling mould reappears in the house after the stones have been torn out and the house scraped and plastered,

## Leviticus 14:44
the priest shall go and examine it, and if the mould has spread in the house, it is a persistent defiling mould; the house is unclean.

## Leviticus 14:45
It must be torn down—its stones, timbers, and all the plaster—and taken out of the town to an unclean place.

## Leviticus 14:46
Anyone who goes into the house while it is closed up will be unclean until evening.

## Leviticus 14:47
Anyone who sleeps or eats in the house must wash their clothes.

## Leviticus 14:48
But if the priest comes to examine it and the mould has not spread after the house has been plastered, he shall pronounce the house clean, because the defiling mould is gone.

## Leviticus 14:49
To purify the house, he shall take two birds, cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop.

## Leviticus 14:50
He shall kill one of the birds over fresh water in a clay pot.

## Leviticus 14:51
Then he shall take the cedar wood, the hyssop, the scarlet yarn, and the live bird, dip them into the blood of the dead bird and the fresh water, and sprinkle the house seven times.

## Leviticus 14:52
He shall purify the house with the bird’s blood, the fresh water, the live bird, the cedar wood, the hyssop, and the scarlet yarn.

## Leviticus 14:53
Then he shall release the live bird in the open fields outside the town. In this way, he will make atonement for the house, and it will be clean.”

## Leviticus 14:54
This is the law for any defiling skin disease, for a sore,

## Leviticus 14:55
for defiling moulds in fabric or in a house,

## Leviticus 14:56
and for a swelling, a rash, or a shiny spot,

## Leviticus 14:57
to determine when something is clean or unclean. This is the law for defiling skin diseases and defiling moulds.
