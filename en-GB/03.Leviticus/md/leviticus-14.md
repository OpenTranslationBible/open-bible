# Leviticus Chapter 14

## Leviticus 14:1
The Lord said to Moses,

## Leviticus 14:2
“These are the regulations for anyone who has been cleansed from a defiling skin disease. They must be brought to the priest.

## Leviticus 14:3
The priest is to go outside the camp and examine them. If they have been healed,

## Leviticus 14:4
the priest shall order two live clean birds, some cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop to be brought for the person being cleansed.

## Leviticus 14:5
Then the priest shall order that one of the birds be killed over fresh water in a clay pot.

## Leviticus 14:6
He is to take the live bird, along with the cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop, and dip them into the blood of the bird that was killed.

## Leviticus 14:7
Seven times he shall sprinkle the one to be cleansed of the skin disease and pronounce them clean. Then he shall release the live bird into the open fields.

## Leviticus 14:8
The one being cleansed must wash their clothes, shave off all their hair, and bathe with water. Then they may come into the camp but must stay outside their tent for seven days.

## Leviticus 14:9
On the seventh day they must shave off all their hair—head, beard, eyebrows—and wash their clothes and bathe again. Then they will be clean.

## Leviticus 14:10
On the eighth day, they must bring two male lambs and one ewe lamb, each without defect, along with a grain offering and a log of oil.

## Leviticus 14:11
The priest shall present them before the Lord at the entrance to the tent of meeting.

## Leviticus 14:12
He shall take one of the male lambs and offer it as a guilt offering, along with the log of oil; he shall wave them before the Lord.

## Leviticus 14:13
Then he shall slaughter the lamb in the Holy Place where the sin offering and burnt offering are slaughtered.

## Leviticus 14:14
The priest is to take some of the blood and put it on the right earlobe, the right thumb, and the right big toe of the one being cleansed.

## Leviticus 14:15
Then the priest shall take some of the oil, pour it in his left palm,

## Leviticus 14:16
dip his right finger into the oil and sprinkle it seven times before the Lord.

## Leviticus 14:17
The rest of the oil is to be put on the right earlobe, thumb, and big toe of the person being cleansed.

## Leviticus 14:18
The remaining oil in the priest’s hand shall be put on the person’s head to make atonement for them.

## Leviticus 14:19
Then the priest shall offer the sin offering to make atonement and the burnt offering to complete the cleansing.

## Leviticus 14:20
He shall sacrifice the burnt offering and the grain offering, and the person will be clean.

## Leviticus 14:21
If the person cannot afford these, they may bring one male lamb and a tenth of an ephah of flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, plus a log of oil,

## Leviticus 14:22
and two doves or two young pigeons—one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering.

## Leviticus 14:23
On the eighth day, they must be brought before the priest at the entrance to the tent of meeting.

## Leviticus 14:24
The priest shall take the lamb for the guilt offering and the log of oil and wave them before the Lord.

## Leviticus 14:25
He shall slaughter the lamb and take some of its blood and put it on the right earlobe, thumb, and big toe of the person being cleansed.

## Leviticus 14:26
He shall pour oil into his left palm

## Leviticus 14:27
and sprinkle it seven times before the Lord with his finger.

## Leviticus 14:28
He shall apply some oil to the person’s right earlobe, thumb, and big toe where the blood was placed.

## Leviticus 14:29
The rest of the oil in his hand shall go on the head of the person being cleansed.

## Leviticus 14:30
He shall offer the doves or pigeons—one for a sin offering and one for a burnt offering—with the grain offering.

## Leviticus 14:31
In this way, the priest makes atonement, and they will be clean.

## Leviticus 14:32
These are the regulations for anyone who has a defiling skin disease but cannot afford the usual offerings.

## Leviticus 14:33
The Lord said to Moses and Aaron,

## Leviticus 14:34
“When you enter the land of Canaan, which I am giving you, and I put a spreading mildew in a house,

## Leviticus 14:35
the owner must go to the priest and say, ‘I have seen something like mildew in my house.’

## Leviticus 14:36
The priest must order the house to be emptied before he enters to examine it, so nothing will be declared unclean.

## Leviticus 14:37
If the mildew appears greenish or reddish and is deep in the wall,

## Leviticus 14:38
the priest shall go out and close up the house for seven days.

## Leviticus 14:39
On the seventh day, he shall return and inspect the house. If the mildew has spread,

## Leviticus 14:40
he must order the contaminated stones to be torn out and thrown outside the city.

## Leviticus 14:41
The house must be scraped all over and the plaster discarded outside the city.

## Leviticus 14:42
Then new stones are to be brought in and the house replastered.

## Leviticus 14:43
If the mildew reappears after this,

## Leviticus 14:44
the priest must inspect it. If it has spread, the house is defiled—it must be torn down completely.

## Leviticus 14:45
All materials must be taken outside the city to an unclean place.

## Leviticus 14:46
Anyone who goes into the house while it is closed up will be unclean until evening.

## Leviticus 14:47
Anyone who sleeps or eats in the house must wash their clothes.

## Leviticus 14:48
If the mildew has not spread after the house was replastered, the priest shall pronounce it clean.

## Leviticus 14:49
To cleanse the house, he must take two birds, cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop.

## Leviticus 14:50
He is to kill one bird over fresh water in a clay pot.

## Leviticus 14:51
He shall take the cedar wood, hyssop, scarlet yarn, and the live bird, dip them in the blood and water, and sprinkle the house seven times.

## Leviticus 14:52
He shall purify the house with the bird’s blood, the fresh water, the live bird, the wood, hyssop, and yarn.

## Leviticus 14:53
Then he shall release the live bird into the open fields. In this way, he makes atonement for the house, and it will be clean.

## Leviticus 14:54
These are the regulations for any defiling skin condition,

## Leviticus 14:55
for fabric, houses,

## Leviticus 14:56
swelling, rash or shiny spot—

## Leviticus 14:57
to determine when something is clean or unclean. These are the regulations for defiling skin diseases and mildew.
