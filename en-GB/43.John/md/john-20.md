# John Chapter 20

## John 20:1

On the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance.

## John 20:2

She ran to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved, and said, “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have put him!”

## John 20:3

Then Peter and the other disciple set out for the tomb.

## John 20:4

They were both running, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first.

## John 20:5

He bent down and looked in at the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in.

## John 20:6

Then Simon Peter came along behind him and went straight into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying there,

## John 20:7

and the cloth that had been around Jesus’ head, not lying with the linen cloths but folded up in a place by itself.

## John 20:8

Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, also went inside. He saw and believed.

## John 20:9

For they did not yet understand from Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead.

## John 20:10

Then the disciples returned to their homes.

## John 20:11

But Mary stood outside the tomb weeping. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb

## John 20:12

and saw two angels in white, seated where Jesus’ body had been, one at the head and the other at the foot.

## John 20:13

They asked her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” She replied, “They have taken my Lord away, and I do not know where they have put him.”

## John 20:14

At this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not realise that it was Jesus.

## John 20:15

He asked her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?” Thinking he was the gardener, she said, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will take him away.”

## John 20:16

Jesus said to her, “Mary.” She turned towards him and cried out in Hebrew, “Rabboni!” (which means “Teacher”).

## John 20:17

Jesus said, “Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. Go instead to my brothers and tell them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’”

## John 20:18

Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news, “I have seen the Lord!” And she told them that he had said these things to her.

## John 20:19

On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples were together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jewish leaders, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you!”

## John 20:20

After he said this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord.

## John 20:21

Again Jesus said, “Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am sending you.”

## John 20:22

And with that he breathed on them and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit.

## John 20:23

If you forgive anyone’s sins, their sins are forgiven; if you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven.”

## John 20:24

Now Thomas, also known as Didymus, one of the Twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came.

## John 20:25

So the other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord!” But he said to them, “Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.”

---

## John 20:26

A week later his disciples were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you!”

## John 20:27

Then he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.”

## John 20:28

Thomas said to him, “My Lord and my God!”

## John 20:29

Then Jesus told him, “Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.”

## John 20:30

Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book.

## John 20:31

But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.
