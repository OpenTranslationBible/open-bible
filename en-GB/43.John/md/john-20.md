# John Chapter 20

## John 20:1

Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came early to the tomb, while it was still dark,  
and _saw_ the stone already removed from the tomb.

## John 20:2

So she ran and _came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved_, and _said to them_,  
“They have taken the Lord from the tomb, and we do not know where they have put Him!”

## John 20:3

So Peter and the other disciple left, and they were going to the tomb.

## John 20:4

The two were running together;  
and the other disciple ran ahead faster than Peter, and came to the tomb first;

## John 20:5

and he stooped to look in, and _saw_ the linen wrappings lying there; however, he did not go in.

## John 20:6

So Simon Peter also _came_, following him, and he _entered the tomb_;  
and he _looked at_ the linen wrappings lying there,

## John 20:7

and the face-cloth which had been on His head, not lying with the linen wrappings,  
but folded up in a place by itself.

## John 20:8

So the other disciple who had first come to the tomb also entered then, and he saw and believed.

## John 20:9

For they did not yet understand the Scripture, that He must rise from the dead.

## John 20:10

So the disciples went away again to their own homes.

## John 20:11

But Mary was standing outside the tomb, weeping;  
so, as she wept, she stooped to look into the tomb;

## John 20:12

and she _saw_ two angels in white sitting, one at the head and one at the feet,  
where the body of Jesus had been lying.

## John 20:13

And they _said to her_, “Woman, why are you weeping?”  
She _said to them_, “Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they put Him.”

## John 20:14

When she had said this, she turned around and _saw_ Jesus standing there,  
and yet she did not know that it was Jesus.

## John 20:15

Jesus _said to her_, “Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?”  
Thinking that He was the gardener, she _said to Him_,  
“Sir, if you have carried Him away, tell me where you put Him, and I will take Him away.”

## John 20:16

Jesus _said to her_, “Mary!”  
She turned and _said to Him_ in Hebrew, “Rabboni!” (which means, Teacher).

## John 20:17

Jesus _said to her_,  
“Stop clinging to Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father;  
but go to My brothers and say to them,  
‘I am ascending to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God.’”

## John 20:18

Mary Magdalene _came and announced to the disciples_,  
“I have seen the Lord,” and that He had said these things to her.

## John 20:19

Now when it was evening on that day, the first day of the week,  
and when the doors were shut where the disciples were together due to fear of the Jews,  
Jesus came and stood in their midst, and _said to them_, “Peace be to you.”

## John 20:20

And when He had said this, He showed them both His hands and His side.  
The disciples then rejoiced when they saw the Lord.

## John 20:21

So Jesus _said to them again_, “Peace be to you;  
just as the Father has sent Me, I also send you.”

## John 20:22

And when He had said this, He breathed on them and _said to them_, “Receive the Holy Spirit.

## John 20:23

If you forgive the sins of any, their sins have been forgiven them;  
if you retain the sins of any, they have been retained.”

## John 20:24

But Thomas, one of the twelve, who was called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.

## John 20:25

So the other disciples were saying to him, “We have seen the Lord!”  
But he said to them,  
“Unless I see in His hands the imprint of the nails, and put my finger into the place of the nails,  
and put my hand into His side, I will not believe.”

---

## John 20:26

Eight days later His disciples were again inside, and Thomas was with them.  
Jesus _came_, the doors having been shut, and stood in their midst and _said_, “Peace be to you.”

## John 20:27

Then He _said to Thomas_,  
“Place your finger here, and see My hands; and take your hand and put it into My side;  
and do not continue in unbelief, but be a believer.”

## John 20:28

Thomas answered and said to Him, “My Lord and my God!”

## John 20:29

Jesus _said to him_,  
“Because you have seen Me, have you now believed?  
Blessed are they who did not see, and yet believed.”

---

## John 20:30

So then, many other signs Jesus also performed in the presence of the disciples,  
which are not written in this book;

## John 20:31

but these have been written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God;  
and that by believing you may have life in His name.
