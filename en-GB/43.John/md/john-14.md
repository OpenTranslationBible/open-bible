# John Chapter 14

## John 14:1

“Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God; trust also in me.

## John 14:2

In my Father’s house are many rooms. If it were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you?

## John 14:3

And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will return and take you to be with me so that you may also be where I am.

## John 14:4

And you know the way to where I am going.”

## John 14:5

Thomas said to him, “Lord, we do not understand where you are heading, so how can we know the way?”

## John 14:6

Jesus replied, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.

## John 14:7

If you really knew me, you would know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him.”

## John 14:8

Philip said to him, “Lord, show us the Father, and that will be sufficient for us.”

## John 14:9

Jesus said to him, “Have I been with you so long, and yet you do not know me, Philip? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, ‘Show us the Father’?

## John 14:10

Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words I speak to you are not from my own authority. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work.

## John 14:11

Trust me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or at least believe because of the works themselves.

## John 14:12

Truly, truly I say to you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father.

## John 14:13

And whatever you request in my name, I will do, so that the Father may be honoured in the Son.

## John 14:14

If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it.

## John 14:15

“If you love me, you will keep my commandments.

## John 14:16

And I will ask the Father, and he will provide you with another Helper, to be with you forever—

## John 14:17

the Spirit of truth. The world cannot accept him, because it neither perceives him nor recognises him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you.

## John 14:18

I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you.

## John 14:19

In a little while, the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me. Because I live, you also will live.

## John 14:20

On that day you will understand that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you.

## John 14:21

Whoever has my commandments and keeps them is the one who loves me. The one who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love them and reveal myself to them.”

## John 14:22

Then Judas (not Iscariot) said, “Lord, how is it that you are going to reveal yourself to us and not to the world?”

## John 14:23

Jesus replied, “If anyone loves me, he will obey my teaching. My Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him.

## John 14:24

Anyone who does not love me will not obey my teaching. The words you hear are not my own; they belong to the Father who sent me.

---

## John 14:25

“I have shared these things with you while I am still with you.

## John 14:26

But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and remind you of everything I have said to you.

## John 14:27

Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled, nor let them be afraid.

## John 14:28

You heard me say, ‘I am going away and I am returning to you.’ If you loved me, you would rejoice that I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I.

## John 14:29

I have informed you now before it happens, so that when it does happen you may believe.

## John 14:30

I will not say much more to you, for the ruler of this world is coming. He has no power over me,

## John 14:31

but he comes so that the world may understand that I love the Father and do exactly what my Father has commanded me. “Come now; let us leave.
