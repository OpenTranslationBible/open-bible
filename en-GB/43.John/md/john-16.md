# John Chapter 16

## John 16:1

“I have spoken these things to you so that you will not be led into sin.

## John 16:2

They will exclude you from the synagogue; indeed, a time is coming when anyone who kills you will think they are offering a service to God.

## John 16:3

They will do these things because they have not recognised the Father or me.

## John 16:4

I have informed you of this so that when their time comes, you will remember that I mentioned it to you. I did not tell you this from the beginning because I was with you.

## John 16:5

However, I am now returning to the One who sent me, and none of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’

## John 16:6

Instead, because I have said these things, sorrow has filled your hearts.

## John 16:7

Nevertheless, I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away. For if I do not go, the Helper will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.

## John 16:8

And when he comes, he will convict the world concerning sin, righteousness, and judgement:

## John 16:9

concerning sin, because they do not believe in me;

## John 16:10

concerning righteousness, because I am returning to the Father and you will no longer see me;

## John 16:11

and concerning judgement, because the ruler of this world is judged.

## John 16:12

“I have much more to share with you, but you cannot bear it now.

## John 16:13

But when the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will disclose to you what is to come.

## John 16:14

He will glorify me because he will take from what is mine and will disclose it to you.

## John 16:15

All that belongs to the Father is mine. This is why I said the Spirit will take from what is mine and will disclose it to you.

---

## John 16:16

“In a little while, you will no longer see me; and again, in a little while, you will see me.”

## John 16:17

At this, some of his disciples said to one another, “What does he mean by saying, ‘In a little while, you will no longer see me; and again, in a little while, you will see me,’ and ‘because I am going to the Father’?”

## John 16:18

They kept asking, “What does he mean by ‘a little while’? We do not understand what he is saying.”

---

## John 16:19

Jesus knew they wanted to ask him about this, so he said to them, “Are you discussing among yourselves what I meant when I said, ‘In a little while, you will no longer see me, and again, in a little while, you will see me’?

## John 16:20

Truly, truly I say to you, you will weep and mourn while the world rejoices. You will grieve, but your grief will turn to joy.

## John 16:21

A woman in labour has pain because her time has come; but when her child is born, she forgets the anguish because of her joy that a child is born into the world.

## John 16:22

So it is with you: Now is your time of grief, but I will see you again and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take away your joy.

---

## John 16:23

In that day, you will no longer ask me anything. Truly, truly I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in my name, he will give you.

## John 16:24

Up to this point, you have not asked for anything in my name. Ask in my name and you will receive, that your joy may be fulfilled.

---

## John 16:25

“I have spoken these things to you in figures of speech; a time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures of speech, but will tell you plainly about the Father.

## John 16:26

On that day, you will ask in my name. I am not saying that I will ask the Father on your behalf.

## John 16:27

For the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God.

## John 16:28

I came from the Father and have come into the world; now I am departing from the world and returning to the Father.”

---

## John 16:29

Then his disciples said, “Now you are speaking plainly and not using figures of speech.

## John 16:30

Now we see that you know all things and do not need anyone to question you. This makes us believe that you came from God.”

## John 16:31

Jesus responded, “Do you believe now?”

## John 16:32

“Behold, a time is coming, and in fact has come, when you will be scattered, each to your own home. You will leave me all alone. Yet I am not alone, for my Father is with me.

## John 16:33

“I have told you these things so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have tribulation. But take heart! I have overcome the world.”
