## John 17:1

After Jesus spoke these words, He lifted His eyes to heaven and said, “Father, the hour has arrived; glorify Your Son, so that the Son may glorify You.

For You have granted Him authority over all humanity, that He might give eternal life to all those You have entrusted to Him.

## John 17:3

And this is eternal life: that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom You have sent.

## John 17:4

I have honored You on the earth by finishing the work You assigned to Me.

## John 17:5

And now, Father, glorify Me in Your presence with the glory I had with You before the world existed.

## John 17:6

“I have revealed Your name to those whom You gave Me out of the world. They were Yours; You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your word.

## John 17:7

Now they understand that everything You have given Me comes from You.

## John 17:8

For I have given them the words You gave Me, and they have received them. They have truly known that I came from You, and they have believed that You sent Me.

## John 17:9

I pray for them. I do not pray for the world, but for those You have given Me, for they are Yours.

## John 17:10

All that I have is Yours, and all that You have is Mine; and I have been glorified in them.

## John 17:11

I will no longer be in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to You. Holy Father, keep them in Your name, the name You have given Me, so that they may be one as We are one.

## John 17:12

While I was with them, I kept them in Your name, which You have given Me. I protected them, and none of them was lost except the son of perdition, so that Scripture might be fulfilled.

## John 17:13

But now I am coming to You, and I speak these things in the world so that they may have the full measure of My joy within them.

## John 17:14

I have given them Your word, and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.

## John 17:15

I do not ask that You remove them from the world, but that You protect them from the evil one.

## John 17:16

They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.

## John 17:17

Sanctify them by the truth; Your word is truth.

## John 17:18

As You sent Me into the world, I have also sent them into the world.

## John 17:19

And for their sake I sanctify Myself, so that they too may be truly sanctified.

## John 17:20

“I do not pray for these alone, but also for those who will believe in Me through their message,

## John 17:21

that all of them may be united, Father, just as You are in Me and I am in You. May they also be in Us, so that the world may believe that You have sent Me.

## John 17:22

I have given them the glory that You gave Me, so that they may be united as We are one—

## John 17:23

I in them and You in Me—so that they may be brought to complete unity. Then the world will know that You sent Me and have loved them just as You have loved Me.

## John 17:24

“Father, I desire that those You have given Me may be with Me where I am, to see My glory, the glory You have given Me because You loved Me before the foundation of the world.

“Righteous Father, though the world does not know You, I know You, and these know that You have sent Me.

## John 17:26

I have made Your name known to them, and will continue to make it known, so that the love You have for Me may be in them, and I in them.”
