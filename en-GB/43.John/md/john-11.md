# John Chapter 11

## John 11:1

There was a man named Lazarus who was sick. He was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.

## John 11:2

(It was this Mary who anointed the Lord with perfume and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was ill.)

## John 11:3

So the sisters sent word to Him, saying, “Lord, the one You love is ill.”

## John 11:4

When Jesus heard this, He said, “This illness will not lead to death. No, it is for God’s glory, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.”

## John 11:5

Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.

## John 11:6

So when He heard that Lazarus was ill, He stayed where He was for two more days,

## John 11:7

and then He said to His disciples, “Let us return to Judea.”

## John 11:8

“But Teacher,” they said, “not long ago the people there tried to stone You, and yet You are going back?”

## John 11:9

Jesus answered, “Are there not twelve hours of daylight? Anyone who walks in the daytime does not stumble, for they see by this world’s light.

## John 11:10

It is when someone walks at night that they stumble, for they have no light.”

---

## John 11:11

After He had said this, He continued, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going there to awaken him.”

## John 11:12

His disciples replied, “Lord, if he sleeps, he will recover.”

## John 11:13

Jesus had been speaking of his passing, but His disciples thought He referred to natural sleep.

## John 11:14

So He told them clearly, “Lazarus has died,

## John 11:15

and for your sake I am pleased I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.”

## John 11:16

Then Thomas, also known as Didymus, said to the rest of the disciples, “Let us also go, that we may face death with Him.”

---

## John 11:17

Upon His arrival, Jesus found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days.

## John 11:18

Bethany was only a short distance from Jerusalem,

## John 11:19

and many Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them concerning their brother.

## John 11:20

When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet Him, while Mary remained at home.

## John 11:21

“Lord,” Martha said to Jesus, “had You been here, I know my brother would not have died.

## John 11:22

But I know that even now God will grant You whatever You ask.”

## John 11:23

Jesus said to her, “Your brother will rise again.”

## John 11:24

Martha replied, “I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.”

## John 11:25

Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in Me will live, even if they die;

## John 11:26

and whoever lives by having faith in Me will never truly die. Do you believe this?”

## John 11:27

“Yes, Lord,” she replied, “I believe that You are the Messiah, the Son of God, who was destined to come into the world.”

---

## John 11:28

After saying this, she went back and called her sister Mary aside. “The Teacher is here,” she said, “and is asking for you.”

## John 11:29

Upon hearing this, Mary rose quickly and went to Him.

## John 11:30

Jesus had not yet entered the village, but remained at the place where Martha had met Him.

## John 11:31

When the Jews who had been with Mary in the house, comforting her, noticed how quickly she got up and went out, they followed her, thinking she was going to the tomb to mourn there.

## John 11:32

When Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw Him, she fell at His feet. “Lord”, she said “had You been here, I know my brother would not have died.”

---

## John 11:33

When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her also weeping, He was deeply moved in spirit and distressed.

## John 11:34

“Where have you placed him?” He asked. “Come and see, Lord,” they replied.

## John 11:35

Jesus wept.

## John 11:36

Then the Jews said, “See how He loved him!”

## John 11:37

But some of them said, “Could not He who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?”

---

## John 11:38

Jesus, once again deeply moved, came to the tomb. It was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance.

## John 11:39

“Take away the stone,” He said. “But, Lord,” said Martha, the sister of the deceased, “by this time there is a bad odour, for he has been there four days.”

## John 11:40

Then Jesus said, “Did I not tell you that if you have faith, you will see the glory of God?”

## John 11:41

Then they took away the stone. At this, Jesus looked up and said, “Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.

## John 11:42

I know that You always hear Me, but I say this for the benefit of the people standing here, that they may believe that You sent Me.”

## John 11:43

After saying this, Jesus called in a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!”

## John 11:44

The man who had died came out, his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen, and a cloth around his face. Jesus said to them, “Take off the grave clothes and let him go.”

---

## John 11:45

As a result, many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary, and had seen what Jesus did, believed in Him.

## John 11:46

But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.

---

## John 11:47

Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the Sanhedrin. “What are we achieving?” they asked. “Here is this man performing many signs.

## John 11:48

If we allow Him to continue, everyone will believe in Him, and then the Romans will come and take away both our temple and our nation.”

## John 11:49

Then one of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, spoke up, “You are unaware of what is necessary!

## John 11:50

You do not understand that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish.”

## John 11:51

He did not say this on his own, in fact, as high priest he had already prophesied that year that Jesus would die for the Jewish nation,

## John 11:52

and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of God, to bring them together and unite them as one.

## John 11:53

So from that day on they plotted to end His life.

---

## John 11:54

Consequently, Jesus no longer moved about publicly among the people of Judea. Instead, He withdrew to a region near the wilderness, to a village called Ephraim, where He stayed with His disciples.

## John 11:55

When it was nearly time for the Jewish Passover, many went up from the countryside to Jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the Passover.

## John 11:56

They kept looking for Jesus, and as they stood in the temple courts they asked one another, “What do you think? Is He coming to the festival at all?”

## John 11:57

But the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that anyone who found out where He was should report it so that they might arrest Him.
