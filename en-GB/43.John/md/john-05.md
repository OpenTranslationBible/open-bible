# John Chapter 5

## John 5:1

After these events, there was a Jewish festival, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

## John 5:2

In Jerusalem, by the Sheep Gate, there is a pool, which in Aramaic is called Bethesda, surrounded by five colonnades.

## John 5:3

In these colonnades lay a multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, or paralysed.

## John 5:4

[4]

## John 5:5

There was a man there who had been unable to walk for thirty-eight years.

## John 5:6

When Jesus saw him lying there and knew he had been in that condition for a long time, he asked him, “Do you want to get well?”

## John 5:7

The sick man answered, “Sir, I have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred. While I am trying to get in, someone else steps down before me.”

## John 5:8

Jesus instructed him, “Stand up, pick up your mat, and walk.”

## John 5:9

Immediately the man was healed; he picked up his mat and walked. Now that day was a Sabbath.

---

## John 5:10

So the Jewish leaders said to the man who had been healed, “It is the Sabbath; it is not lawful for you to carry your mat.”

## John 5:11

But he replied, “The one who healed me told me, ‘Pick up your mat and walk.’”

## John 5:12

They asked him, “Who is the person who instructed you to pick it up and walk?”

## John 5:13

The man who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the crowd.

---

## John 5:14

Later Jesus found him at the temple and said, “Look, you are well again. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.”

## John 5:15

The man went away and informed the Jewish leaders that it was Jesus who had made him well.

## John 5:16

For this reason, the Jewish leaders began to persecute Jesus, because he was doing these things on the Sabbath.

## John 5:17

But Jesus answered them, “My Father is working until now, and I am working too.”

## John 5:18

For this reason, they sought all the more to kill him, because he was not only breaking the Sabbath but also calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.

---

## John 5:19

Therefore, Jesus responded, “Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can only do what he sees the Father doing, for whatever the Father does, the Son does likewise.

## John 5:20

For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. He will show him even greater works than these, so that you will be amazed.

## John 5:21

For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so the Son gives life to whom he wishes.

## John 5:22

Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgement to the Son,

## John 5:23

so that all may honour the Son just as they honour the Father. Whoever does not honour the Son does not honour the Father who sent him.

---

## John 5:24

“Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be judged but has crossed over from death to life.

## John 5:25

Truly, truly, I say to you, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.

## John 5:26

For just as the Father has life in himself, so he has also granted the Son to have life in himself.

## John 5:27

And he has given him the authority to carry out judgement, because he is the Son of Man.

## John 5:28

Do not be surprised at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice

## John 5:29

and will come out—those who have done what is good will rise to live, and those who have done what is evil will rise to be condemned.

---

## John 5:30

By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgement is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me.

## John 5:31

“If I testify about myself, my testimony is not considered valid.

## John 5:32

There is another who testifies in my favour, and I am confident that his testimony about me is true.

---

## John 5:33

You have sent messengers to John, and he has spoken to you of the truth.

## John 5:34

Not that I rely on human testimony, but I mention it so that you may be saved.

## John 5:35

John was a lamp that burned and gave light, and you chose for a time to enjoy his illumination.

## John 5:36

But I have a testimony greater than that of John. For the works that the Father has given me to complete—the very works I am doing—testify that the Father has sent me.

---

## John 5:37

And the Father who sent me has himself testified concerning me. You have neither heard his voice nor seen his form,

## John 5:38

nor does his word remain in you, as you do not believe the one he sent.

## John 5:39

You diligently study the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about me,

## John 5:40

yet you are unwilling to come to me to receive life.

---

## John 5:41

I do not seek glory from people,

## John 5:42

but I know you. I understand that you do not have the love of God within you.

## John 5:43

I have come in my Father’s name, and you do not accept me. Yet if another comes in his own name, you will accept him.

## John 5:44

How can you believe, since you seek approval from one another but do not seek the glory that comes from the only God?

## John 5:45

Do not think I will accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, on whom your hopes are set.

## John 5:46

If you had faith in Moses, you would have faith in me, for he wrote about me.

## John 5:47

But if you do not believe what he wrote, how will you trust in what I say?
