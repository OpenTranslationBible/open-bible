# John Chapter 6

## John 6:1

After this, Jesus went to the other side of the Sea of Galilee, also known as the Sea of Tiberias.

## John 6:2

A large crowd followed Him, because they witnessed the signs He performed on those who were ill.

## John 6:3

Jesus went up onto a mountainside and sat down there with His disciples.

## John 6:4

The Jewish festival of Passover was approaching.

## John 6:5

When Jesus looked up and saw a large crowd coming towards Him, He said to Philip, “Where can we buy bread for these people to eat?”

## John 6:6

He said this to test him, for He already knew what He was going to do.

## John 6:7

Philip replied, “Two hundred denarii worth of bread wouldn’t be enough for each one to have a little.”

## John 6:8

One of His disciples, Andrew, who was Simon Peter’s brother, said to Him,

## John 6:9

“There is a boy here with five barley loaves and two fish, but what are they among so many?”

## John 6:10

Jesus said, “Have the people sit down.” There was plenty of grass there, so they sat down, about five thousand men in number.

## John 6:11

Then Jesus took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed them to those who were seated; He did the same with the fish, giving them as much as they wanted.

## John 6:12

When they had all eaten their fill, He said to His disciples, “Gather the fragments left over, so that nothing may be wasted.”

## John 6:13

So they collected them and filled twelve baskets with the remaining pieces of the five barley loaves.

## John 6:14

When the people saw the sign He had performed, they said, “This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world.”

---

## John 6:15

Knowing that they intended to come and take Him by force to make Him king, Jesus withdrew again to the mountain by Himself.

## John 6:16

When evening came, His disciples went down to the sea,

## John 6:17

got into a boat, and set off across the sea to Capernaum. It was already dark, and Jesus had not yet joined them.

## John 6:18

The sea became turbulent due to a strong wind.

## John 6:19

When they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and approaching the boat, and they were frightened.

## John 6:20

But He said to them, “It is I; do not be afraid.”

## John 6:21

Then they welcomed Him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the shore where they were heading.

---

## John 6:22

The next day, the crowd that had stayed on the opposite shore realised that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not entered it with His disciples, who had gone away alone.

## John 6:23

Other boats from Tiberias came near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had expressed gratitude.

## John 6:24

When the crowd realised neither Jesus nor His disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum in search of Jesus.

---

## John 6:25

When they found Him on the other side of the sea, they asked Him, “Rabbi, when did You arrive here?”

## John 6:26

Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, you are looking for Me not because you saw the signs, but because you ate the loaves and were filled.

## John 6:27

Do not work for food that perishes, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on Him, God the Father has set His seal.”

## John 6:28

Then they asked Him, “What must we do to perform the works God requires?”

## John 6:29

Jesus answered, “The work of God is to believe in the One He has sent.”

---

## John 6:30

So they asked Him, “What sign will You give that we may see it and believe You? What work will You do?

## John 6:31

Our forefathers ate manna in the desert; as it is written: ‘He provided them with bread from heaven to eat.’”

## John 6:32

Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but My Father who gives you the true bread from heaven.

## John 6:33

For the bread of God is that which descends from heaven and grants life to the world.”

## John 6:34

They said to Him, “Lord, always give us this bread.”

---

## John 6:35

Jesus declared, “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to Me shall never hunger, and whoever believes in Me shall never thirst.

## John 6:36

But as I told you, you have seen Me, and yet you do not believe.

## John 6:37

All that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and whoever comes to Me I will never drive away.

## John 6:38

For I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.

## John 6:39

And this is the purpose of Him who sent Me, that I shall not lose any of those He has given Me, but raise them up at the last day.

## John 6:40

For it is My Father’s desire that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in Him shall have eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day.”

---

## John 6:41

At this, the Jews began to grumble about Him because He said, “I am the bread that came down from heaven.”

## John 6:42

They said, “Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can He now say, ‘I have come down from heaven’?”

## John 6:43

Jesus answered, “Cease your murmuring among yourselves.

## John 6:44

No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me, first calls them, and so I will raise them up at the last day.

## John 6:45

It is written in the Prophets: ‘They will all be instructed by God.’ Everyone who has heard the Father and learned from Him comes to Me.

## John 6:46

No one has seen the Father except the One who is from God; He alone has seen the Father.

## John 6:47

Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes possesses eternal life.

## John 6:48

I am the bread of life.

## John 6:49

Your forefathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.

## John 6:50

But here is the bread that descends from heaven, which anyone may eat and not die.

## John 6:51

I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, they will live forever. This bread is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.”

---

## John 6:52

Then the Jews began to argue intensely among themselves, “How can this man give us His flesh to eat?”

## John 6:53

Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly I say to you, unless you eat of the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you can have no life in you.

## John 6:54

Moreover, whoever eats of My flesh and drinks My blood gains eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day.

## John 6:55

For My flesh is true food and My blood is true drink.

## John 6:56

Those who eat of My flesh and drink of My blood will remain in Me, and I in them.

## John 6:57

Just as the living Father sent Me and I live because of the Father, so the one who partakes of Me will live because of Me.

## John 6:58

This is the bread that has come down from heaven. Your forefathers ate manna and died, but whoever feeds on this bread will live forever.”

## John 6:59

He expressed these teachings while instructing in the synagogue in Capernaum.

---

## John 6:60

On hearing it, many of His disciples said, “This is a difficult teaching. Who can accept it?”

## John 6:61

Aware that His disciples were murmuring about this, Jesus said to them, “Does this offend you?

## John 6:62

What if you were to see the Son of Man ascend to where He was before?

## John 6:63

The Spirit gives life; the flesh counts for nothing. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and life.

## John 6:64

Yet there are some of you who do not believe.” For Jesus knew from the beginning who did not believe and who would betray Him.

## John 6:65

He continued, “This is why I told you that no one can come to Me unless the Father has enabled them.”

---

## John 6:66

From this point, many of His disciples turned back and no longer followed Him.

## John 6:67

“You do not want to leave as well, do you?” Jesus asked the Twelve.

## John 6:68

Simon Peter answered Him, “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life.

## John 6:69

We have come to believe and to understand that You are the Holy One of God.”

## John 6:70

Then Jesus replied, “Did I not choose you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil!”

## John 6:71

He was referring to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, who, though one of the Twelve, was later to betray Him.
