# John Chapter 9

## John 9:1

As Jesus went along, He saw a man who had been blind from birth.

## John 9:2

The disciples asked of Him, “Teacher, who was it that sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?”

## John 9:3

Jesus replied, “Neither this man nor his parents sinned; but this happened so that the works of God might be displayed in him.

## John 9:4

We must carry out the tasks of Him who sent Me while it is still day. Night is approaching, when no one can work.

## John 9:5

As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”

## John 9:6

After saying this, He spat on the ground, made some mud with the saliva, and applied it to the man’s eyes.

## John 9:7

He said to him, “Go, wash in the Pool of Siloam” (this word means “Sent”). So the man went and washed, and returned seeing.

## John 9:8

His neighbours and those who had previously seen him begging asked, “Isn’t this the same man who used to sit and beg?”

## John 9:9

Some said, “This is he.” Others said, “No, but he looks like him.” But he himself declared, “I am the man.”

## John 9:10

“How were your eyes opened?” they asked.

## John 9:11

He answered, “The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. He told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and then I could see.”

## John 9:12

They asked him, “Where is this man?” He said, “I do not know.”

---

## John 9:13

They took the man who had been blind to the Pharisees.

## John 9:14

Now the day on which Jesus made the mud and opened the man’s eyes was a Sabbath.

## John 9:15

The Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said to them, “He put mud on my eyes, and I washed, and now I see.”

## John 9:16

Some of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, because He does not keep the Sabbath.” But others asked, “How can a sinner perform such signs?” So there was division among them.

## John 9:17

They turned again to the blind man, “What do you say about Him, since He opened your eyes?” The man replied, “He is a prophet.”

---

## John 9:18

The Jewish leaders did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight.

## John 9:19

They asked them, “Is this your son, who you claim was born blind? How is it that now he can see?”

## John 9:20

His parents answered, “We know he is our son, and that he was born blind.

## John 9:21

But how he can see now, or who opened his eyes, we do not know. Ask him. He is of age; he will speak for himself.”

## John 9:22

His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders, who had already decided that anyone who acknowledged Jesus as the Messiah would be put out of the synagogue.

## John 9:23

That is why his parents said, “He is of age; ask him.”

## John 9:24

For a second time they summoned the man who had been blind, and said to him, “Give glory to God by telling the truth. We know this man is a sinner.”

## John 9:25

He replied, “Whether He is a sinner or not, I do not know. One thing I do know: I was blind, but now I see.”

## John 9:26

Then they questioned him further, “What did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?”

## John 9:27

He answered, “I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you wish to hear it again? Do you want to become His disciples too?”

## John 9:28

They insulted him and said, “You are this fellow’s disciple! We are disciples of Moses!

## John 9:29

We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this fellow, we do not know where He comes from.”

## John 9:30

The man answered, “Now that is remarkable! You do not know where He comes from, yet He opened my eyes.

## John 9:31

We understand that God does not listen to sinners. He listens to the devout person who does His will.

## John 9:32

It has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind.

## John 9:33

If this man were not from God, He would be unable to do anything.”

## John 9:34

To this they replied, “You were born entirely in sin; how dare you lecture us!” And they cast him out.

---

## John 9:35

Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and when He found him, He said, “Do you believe in the Son of Man?”

## John 9:36

The man asked, “Who is He, sir? Please tell me, so that I may believe in Him.”

## John 9:37

Jesus said, “You have now seen Him; indeed, He is the one speaking with you.”

## John 9:38

The man responded, “Lord, I believe,” and he honoured Him.

---

## John 9:39

Jesus said, “I have come into this world for judgment, so that those who are blind will see and those who see will become blind.”

## John 9:40

Some Pharisees who were with Him heard Him say this and asked, “What? Are we also blind?”

## John 9:41

Jesus said, “If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin; but now that you assert you can see, your guilt remains.
