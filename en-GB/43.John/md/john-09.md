# John Chapter 9

## John 9:1

As Jesus went along, He saw a man who had been blind from birth.

## John 9:2

His disciples asked Him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?”

## John 9:3

Jesus replied, “Neither this man nor his parents sinned; but this happened so that the works of God might be displayed in him.

## John 9:4

We must do the works of Him who sent Me while it is day. Night is coming, when no one can work.

## John 9:5

While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”

## John 9:6

After saying this, He spat on the ground, made some mud with the saliva, and applied it to the man’s eyes.

## John 9:7

He said to him, “Go, wash in the Pool of Siloam” (this word means “Sent”). So the man went and washed, and returned seeing.

## John 9:8

His neighbours and those who had previously seen him begging asked, “Isn’t this the same man who used to sit and beg?”

## John 9:9

Some said, “This is he.” Others said, “No, but he looks like him.” But he himself declared, “I am the man.”

## John 9:10

“How then were your eyes opened?” they asked.

## John 9:11

He answered, “The man they call Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. He told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and then I could see.”

## John 9:12

They asked him, “Where is this man?” He said, “I do not know.”

---

## John 9:13

They brought the man who had been blind to the Pharisees.

## John 9:14

Now the day on which Jesus made the mud and opened the man’s eyes was a Sabbath.

## John 9:15

The Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said to them, “He put mud on my eyes, and I washed, and now I see.”

## John 9:16

Some of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God, because He does not keep the Sabbath.” But others asked, “How can a sinner perform such signs?” So there was division among them.

## John 9:17

They turned again to the blind man, “What do you say about Him, since He opened your eyes?” The man replied, “He is a prophet.”

---

## John 9:18

The Jewish leaders did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight.

## John 9:19

They asked them, “Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How is it that now he can see?”

## John 9:20

His parents answered, “We know he is our son, and that he was born blind.

## John 9:21

But how he can see now, or who opened his eyes, we do not know. Ask him. He is of age; he will speak for himself.”

## John 9:22

His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders, who had already decided that anyone who acknowledged Jesus as the Messiah would be put out of the synagogue.

## John 9:23

That is why his parents said, “He is of age; ask him.”

## John 9:24

For a second time they summoned the man who had been blind, and said to him, “Give glory to God by telling the truth. We know this man is a sinner.”

## John 9:25

He replied, “Whether He is a sinner or not, I do not know. One thing I do know: I was blind, but now I see.”

## John 9:26

Then they asked him, “What did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?”

## John 9:27

He answered, “I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become His disciples too?”

## John 9:28

They insulted him and said, “You are this fellow’s disciple! We are disciples of Moses!

## John 9:29

We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this fellow, we do not know where He comes from.”

## John 9:30

The man answered, “Now that is remarkable! You do not know where He comes from, yet He opened my eyes.

## John 9:31

We know that God does not listen to sinners. He listens to the godly person who does His will.

## John 9:32

Nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind.

## John 9:33

If this man were not from God, He could do nothing.”

## John 9:34

To this they replied, “You were steeped in sin at birth; how dare you lecture us!” And they threw him out.

---

## John 9:35

Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and when He found him, He said, “Do you believe in the Son of Man?”

## John 9:36

“Who is He, sir?” the man asked. “Tell me so that I may believe in Him.”

## John 9:37

Jesus said, “You have now seen Him; in fact, He is the one speaking with you.”

## John 9:38

Then the man said, “Lord, I believe,” and he worshipped Him.

---

## John 9:39

Jesus said, “For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind.”

## John 9:40

Some Pharisees who were with Him heard Him say this and asked, “What? Are we blind too?”

## John 9:41

Jesus said, “If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin; but now that you claim you can see, your guilt remains.
