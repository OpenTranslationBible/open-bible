# John Chapter 10

## John 10:1

“Truly, truly I say to you, anyone who does not enter the sheepfold by the gate but climbs in by another way is a thief and a robber.

## John 10:2

But the one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.

## John 10:3

The gatekeeper allows him to enter, and the sheep come then they hear his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and they follow him.

## John 10:4

When he has brought out all his own, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they recognise his voice.

## John 10:5

They will not follow a stranger; instead, they will flee from him because they do not know the voice of strangers.”

## John 10:6

Jesus used this figure of speech, but they did not understand what he was saying to them.

---

## John 10:7

So Jesus said again, “Truly, truly I say to you, I am the gate for the sheep.

## John 10:8

All who came before me were like thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.

## John 10:9

I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture.

## John 10:10

The thief comes only to steal, kill, and destroy; I have come so that they may have life and have it abundantly.

---

## John 10:11

“I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd is willing to give his life for the sheep.

## John 10:12

The hired hand, who is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches and scatters them.

## John 10:13

He runs away because he is a hired hand and has no concern for the sheep.

## John 10:14

“I am the good shepherd; I recognise my own sheep, and my own sheep recognise me—

## John 10:15

just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I am willing to give my life for the sheep.

## John 10:16

I have other sheep that are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will listen to my voice, and there will be one flock, one shepherd.

## John 10:17

This is why the Father loves me, because I lay down my life so that I may take it back.

## John 10:18

No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have the authority to lay it down and the authority to take it back. This command I received from my Father.”

---

## John 10:19

A division arose again among the Jews because of these words.

## John 10:20

Many of them said, “He has a demon and is mad. Why listen to him?”

## John 10:21

Others said, “These are not the words of one who is demon-possessed. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?”

## John 10:22

At that time, the Festival of Dedication took place in Jerusalem. It was winter,

## John 10:23

and Jesus was walking in the temple courts in Solomon’s Colonnade.

## John 10:24

The Jews gathered around him, saying, “How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly.”

## John 10:25

Jesus answered, “I told you, and you do not believe. The works I do in my Father’s name testify about me,

## John 10:26

but you do not believe because you do not belong to my flock.

## John 10:27

For my sheep hear my voice; I know them, and they follow me.

## John 10:28

I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will take them from my hand.

## John 10:29

My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can take them from the Father’s hand.

## John 10:30

The Father and I are united.”

---

## John 10:31

At this, the crowd picked up stones again to stone him.

## John 10:32

Jesus said to them, “I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these are you stoning me?”

## John 10:33

The Jews answered, “We are not stoning you for any good work, but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God.”

## John 10:34

Jesus replied, “Is it not written in your Law, ‘I have said you are “gods”’?

## John 10:35

If he called them ‘gods,’ to whom the word of God came—and Scripture cannot be disregarded—

## John 10:36

what about the one whom the Father set apart and sent into the world? Why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because I said, ‘I am God’s Son’?

## John 10:37

If I cannot do the works of my Father, do not believe me.

## John 10:38

But if I do do them, even if you don't believe me, believe in the works, so that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.”

## John 10:39

Once more they tried to seize him, but he slipped away from their grasp.

---

## John 10:40

He went back across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptising earlier, and he stayed there.

## John 10:41

Many people came to him and said, “Though John performed no sign, everything John said about this man was true.”

## John 10:42

And in that place, many came to believe in Jesus.
