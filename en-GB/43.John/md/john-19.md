# John Chapter 19

## John 19:1

So Pilate then took Jesus and had Him flogged.

## John 19:2

And the soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and placed it on His head,  
and put a purple cloak on Him;

## John 19:3

and they repeatedly came up to Him and said,  
“Hail, King of the Jews!” and slapped Him in the face again and again.

## John 19:4

And then Pilate came out again and _said to them_,  
“See, I am bringing Him out to you so that you will know that I find no grounds at all for charges in His case.”

## John 19:5

Jesus then came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple cloak.  
And Pilate _said to them_, “Behold, the Man!”

## John 19:6

So when the chief priests and the officers saw Him, they shouted, saying,  
“Crucify, crucify!”  
Pilate _said to them_,  
“Take Him yourselves and crucify Him; for I find no grounds for charges in His case!”

## John 19:7

The Jews answered him,  
“We have a law, and by that law He ought to die, because He made Himself out to be the Son of God.”

## John 19:8

Therefore when Pilate heard this statement, he was even more afraid;

## John 19:9

and he entered the Praetorium again and _said to Jesus_,  
“Where are You from?”  
But Jesus gave him no answer.

## John 19:10

So Pilate _said to Him_,  
“Are You not speaking to me? Do You not know that I have the authority to release You,  
and I have the authority to crucify You?”

## John 19:11

Jesus answered him,  
“You would have no authority over Me at all, if it had not been given to you from above;  
for this reason the one who handed Me over to you has the greater sin.”

## John 19:12

As a result of this, Pilate made efforts to release Him;  
but the Jews shouted, saying,  
“If you release this Man, you are not a friend of Caesar;  
everyone who makes himself out to be a king opposes Caesar!”

## John 19:13

Therefore when Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out,  
and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Pavement—but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.

## John 19:14

Now it was the day of preparation for the Passover; it was about the sixth hour.  
And he _said to the Jews_, “Behold, your King!”

## John 19:15

So they shouted,  
“Away with Him, away with Him, crucify Him!”  
Pilate _said to them_, “Shall I crucify your King?”  
The chief priests answered, “We have no king except Caesar.”

## John 19:16

So then he handed Him over to them to be crucified.

---

## John 19:17

They took Jesus, therefore, and He went out,  
carrying His own cross, to the place called the Place of a Skull, which in Hebrew is called Golgotha.

## John 19:18

There they crucified Him, and with Him two other men, one on either side, and Jesus in between.

## John 19:19

Now Pilate also wrote an inscription and put it on the cross.  
It was written: “JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.”

## John 19:20

Therefore many of the Jews read this inscription,  
because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city;  
and it was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.

## John 19:21

So the chief priests of the Jews were saying to Pilate,  
“Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews’; but rather, ‘He said, I am King of the Jews.’”

## John 19:22

Pilate answered,  
“What I have written, I have written.”

---

## John 19:23

Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took His outer garments and made four parts,  
a part for each soldier; and they also took His tunic—now the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece.

## John 19:24

So they said to one another,  
“Let’s not tear it, but cast lots for it, to decide whose it shall be.”  
This happened so that the Scripture would be fulfilled:  
“They divided My garments among themselves, and they cast lots for My clothing.”  
Therefore the soldiers did these things.

## John 19:25

Now beside the cross of Jesus stood His mother,  
and His mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.

## John 19:26

So when Jesus saw His mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing nearby,  
He _said to His mother_, “Woman, behold, your son!”

## John 19:27

Then He _said to the disciple_, “Behold, your mother!”  
And from that hour the disciple took her into his own household.

---

## John 19:28

After this, Jesus, knowing that all things had already been accomplished,  
in order that the Scripture would be fulfilled, _said_, “I am thirsty.”

## John 19:29

A jar full of sour wine was standing there;  
so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a branch of hyssop and brought it up to His mouth.

## John 19:30

Therefore when Jesus had received the sour wine, He said,  
“It is finished!”  
And He bowed His head and gave up His spirit.

---

## John 19:31

Now then, since it was the day of preparation,  
to prevent the bodies from remaining on the cross on the Sabbath  
(for that Sabbath was a high day),  
the Jews requested of Pilate that their legs be broken, and the bodies be taken away.

## John 19:32

So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man, and of the other who was crucified with Him;

## John 19:33

but after they came to Jesus, when they saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs.

## John 19:34

Yet one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.

## John 19:35

And he who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true;  
and he knows that he is telling the truth, so that you also may believe.

## John 19:36

For these things took place so that the Scripture would be fulfilled:  
“Not a bone of Him shall be broken.”

## John 19:37

And again another Scripture says,  
“They will look at Him whom they pierced.”

---

## John 19:38

Now after these things Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus,  
but a secret one for fear of the Jews, requested of Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus;  
and Pilate granted permission. So he came and took away His body.

## John 19:39

Nicodemus, who had first come to Him by night, also came,  
bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred litra weight.

## John 19:40

So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen wrappings with the spices,  
as is the burial custom of the Jews.

## John 19:41

Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden,  
and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid.

## John 19:42

Therefore, because of the Jewish day of preparation, since the tomb was nearby,  
they laid Jesus there.
