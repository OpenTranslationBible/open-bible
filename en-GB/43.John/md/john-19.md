# John Chapter 19

## John 19:1

Pilate then took Jesus and had Him whipped.

## John 19:2

The soldiers twisted a crown of thorns and placed it on His head, and they clothed Him in a purple robe.

## John 19:3

They approached Him repeatedly, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” and slapped Him in the face.

## John 19:4

Pilate went out again and said to them, “Behold, I am bringing Him out to you so that you may know I find no fault in Him.”

## John 19:5

Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, “Here is the man!”

## John 19:6

When the chief priests and officers saw Him, they cried out, “Crucify Him! Crucify Him!” Pilate said, “Take Him yourselves and crucify Him, for I find no fault in Him.”

## John 19:7

The Jewish leaders answered, “We have a law, and by that law He ought to die, because He made Himself the Son of God.”

## John 19:8

Upon hearing this, Pilate became even more fearful.

## John 19:9

He went back into the palace and asked Jesus, “Where are You from?” But Jesus gave him no answer.

## John 19:10

Pilate said to Him, “Do You refuse to speak to me? Do You not know I have authority to release You and to crucify You?”

## John 19:11

Jesus answered, “You would have no authority over Me unless it had been given to you from above. Therefore, the one who handed Me over to you has the greater sin.”

## John 19:12

From this point on, Pilate sought to release Him, but the Jews cried out, “If you release this man, you are not Caesar’s friend; anyone who claims to be a king opposes Caesar.”

---

## John 19:13

When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Pavement, in Hebrew, Gabbatha.

## John 19:14

It was the day of Preparation for the Passover, about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews, “Behold your King!”

## John 19:15

They shouted, “Away with Him! Crucify Him!” Pilate asked, “Shall I crucify your King?” The chief priests answered, “We have no king but Caesar.”

---

## John 19:16

So Pilate handed Him over to be crucified. The soldiers took charge of Jesus.

---

## John 19:17

Carrying His own cross, He went out to the place called the Place of a Skull, in Hebrew, Golgotha.

## John 19:18

There they crucified Him, and with Him two others, one on each side, with Jesus in the centre.

## John 19:19

Pilate had an inscription written and placed on the cross. It read: “JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.”

## John 19:20

Many Jews read this inscription, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.

## John 19:21

The chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but that He said, ‘I am King of the Jews.’”

## John 19:22

Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.”

---

## John 19:23

When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took His garments and divided them into four parts, one for each soldier, with the tunic remaining. The tunic was seamless, woven in one piece.

## John 19:24

They said to one another, “Let us not tear it, but cast lots to decide whose it shall be.” This was to fulfil the Scripture: “They divided My garments among them, and for My clothing they cast lots.” So the soldiers did these things.

---

## John 19:25

Standing near the cross of Jesus were His mother, His mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.

## John 19:26

When Jesus noticed His mother and the disciple whom He loved standing nearby, He said to His mother, “Dear woman, here is your son!”

## John 19:27

Then He said to the disciple, “Here is your mother!” From that hour, the disciple took her into his own home.

---

## John 19:28

After this, knowing that all was now accomplished, and to fulfil the Scripture, Jesus said, “I am thirsty.”

## John 19:29

A jar full of sour wine was there; so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a branch of hyssop and brought it to His mouth.

## John 19:30

When Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, “It is finished!” And He bowed His head and gave up His spirit.

---

## John 19:31

Since it was the day of Preparation, to prevent the bodies from remaining on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away.

## John 19:32

The soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and of the other who was crucified with Him.

## John 19:33

But when they came to Jesus and saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs.

## John 19:34

Instead, one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.

## John 19:35

He who saw it has testified, and his testimony is true; he knows that he tells the truth, so that you may also believe.

## John 19:36

These events occurred to fulfil the Scripture: “Not one of His bones will be broken.”

## John 19:37

And again another Scripture says, “They will look on Him whom they pierced.”

---

## John 19:38

After these things, Joseph of Arimathea, a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate to take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate granted permission. So he came and took away His body.

## John 19:39

Nicodemus, who had first come to Jesus by night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, weighing about a hundred litras.

## John 19:40

They took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in linen cloths with the spices, according to Jewish burial customs.

## John 19:41

In the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid.

## John 19:42

Because it was the Jewish day of Preparation and the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.
