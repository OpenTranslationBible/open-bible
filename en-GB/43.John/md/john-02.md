# John Chapter 2

## John 2:1

On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there;

## John 2:2

and both Jesus and His disciples were invited to the wedding.

## John 2:3

When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus _said to Him_, “They have no wine.”

## John 2:4

And Jesus _said to her_, “What business do you have with Me, woman? My hour has not yet come.”

## John 2:5

His mother _said to the servants_, “Whatever He tells you, do it.”

## John 2:6

Now there were six stone waterpots standing there for the Jewish custom of purification,  
containing two or three measures each.

## John 2:7

Jesus _said to them_, “Fill the waterpots with water.” So they filled them up to the brim.

## John 2:8

And He _said to them_, “Draw some out now and take it to the headwaiter.” And they took it to him.

## John 2:9

Now when the headwaiter tasted the water which had become wine,  
and did not know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew),  
the headwaiter _called the groom_,

## John 2:10

and _said to him_, “Every man serves the good wine first, and when the guests are drunk, then he serves the poorer wine;  
but you have kept the good wine until now.”

## John 2:11

This beginning of His signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and revealed His glory;  
and His disciples believed in Him.

## John 2:12

After this He went down to Capernaum, He and His mother, His brothers, and His disciples;  
and they stayed there a few days.

---

## John 2:13

The Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

## John 2:14

And within the temple grounds He found those who were selling oxen, sheep, and doves,  
and the money changers seated at their tables.

## John 2:15

And He made a whip of cords, and drove them all out of the temple grounds,  
with the sheep and the oxen;  
and He poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables;

## John 2:16

and to those who were selling the doves He said,  
“Take these things away from here; stop making My Father’s house a place of business!”

## John 2:17

His disciples remembered that it was written:  
“Zeal for Your house will consume Me.”

## John 2:18

The Jews then said to Him,  
“What sign do You show us as your authority for doing these things?”

## John 2:19

Jesus answered and said to them,  
“Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”

## John 2:20

The Jews then said,  
“It took forty-six years to build this temple, and yet You will raise it up in three days?”

## John 2:21

But He was speaking about the temple of His body.

## John 2:22

So when He was raised from the dead, His disciples remembered that He said this;  
and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken.

---

## John 2:23

Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast,  
many believed in His name as they observed His signs which He was doing.

## John 2:24

But Jesus, on His part, was not entrusting Himself to them, because He knew all people,

## John 2:25

and because He did not need anyone to testify about mankind,  
for He Himself knew what was in mankind.
