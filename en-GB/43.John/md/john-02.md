# John Chapter 2

## John 2:1

On the third day, a wedding took place in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was present.

## John 2:2

Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the wedding.

## John 2:3

When the wine was depleted, Jesus' mother said to him, "They have no wine."

## John 2:4

Jesus replied, "Woman, what does this have to do with me? My time has not yet arrived."

## John 2:5

His mother instructed the servants, "Do whatever he tells you."

## John 2:6

Nearby stood six stone water jars, used for the Jewish rites of purification, each holding two or three measures.

## John 2:7

Jesus said to the servants, "Fill the jars with water," and they filled them to the brim.

## John 2:8

Then he instructed them, "Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet." And they did so.

## John 2:9

The master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine, not knowing where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew. He called the bridegroom over

## John 2:10

and remarked, "Everyone serves the best wine first, and when the guests have drunk freely, then the inferior wine; but you have kept the best wine until now."

## John 2:11

This was the first of the signs Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee, revealing his glory; and his disciples believed in him.

## John 2:12

After this, he went down to Capernaum with his mother, brothers, and disciples, and they stayed there for a few days.

## John 2:13

As the Jewish Passover approached, Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

## John 2:14

In the temple courts, he found people selling cattle, sheep, and doves, and others sitting at tables exchanging money.

## John 2:15

He made a whip of cords and drove them all out of the temple courts, along with the sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.

## John 2:16

To those selling doves, he said, "Take these things away! Do not make my Father's house a place of commerce!"

## John 2:17

His disciples remembered that it was written: "Zeal for your house will consume me."

## John 2:18

The Jews then questioned him, "What sign can you show us to prove your authority to do these things?"

## John 2:19

Jesus answered, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."

## John 2:20

They responded, "It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and you will raise it in three days?"

## John 2:21

But he was speaking about the temple of his body.

## John 2:22

After he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the Scripture and the words Jesus had spoken.

## John 2:23

While he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Festival, many people saw the signs he was performing and believed in his name.

## John 2:24

But Jesus did not entrust himself to them, for he knew all people.

## John 2:25

He did not need anyone to testify about mankind, for he himself knew what was in each person.
