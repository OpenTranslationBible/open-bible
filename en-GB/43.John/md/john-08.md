# John Chapter 8

### Some early manuscripts do not have John 8:1 - 8:11 in this location, but do include it

## John 8:1

Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.

## John 8:2

At dawn, He appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people were gathering around Him, and He sat down to teach them.

## John 8:3

The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery and placed her in the centre of the courtyard.

## John 8:4

They addressed Him, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery.

## John 8:5

In the Law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. What then do You say?”

## John 8:6

They were using this question to test Him, so they might have grounds for accusing Him. But Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with His finger.

## John 8:7

When they persisted in questioning Him, He straightened up and said to them, “Let anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.”

## John 8:8

Once more, He stooped down and wrote on the ground.

## John 8:9

When they heard this, they began to leave one by one, starting with the older ones, until only Jesus was left, with the woman standing there.

## John 8:10

Straightening up, Jesus asked her, “Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?”

## John 8:11

“No one, Lord,” she replied. Then Jesus said, “Neither do I condemn you. Go now and sin no more.”

## John 8:12

Jesus spoke again to the people, saying, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows Me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.”

## John 8:13

The Pharisees challenged Him, “You are testifying about Yourself; Your testimony is not valid.”

## John 8:14

Jesus answered, “Even if I testify about Myself, My testimony is valid, for I know where I came from and where I am going. But you do not know where I come from or where I am going.

## John 8:15

You judge by the flesh, according to human standards; I do not judge anyone.

## John 8:16

But even if I do judge, My judgement is true, because I am not alone; I stand with the Father who sent Me.

## John 8:17

In your Law, it is stated that the testimony of two witnesses is true.

## John 8:18

I am one who bears witness about Myself; My other witness is the Father who sent Me.”

## John 8:19

Then they asked Him, “Where is Your Father?” Jesus replied, “You do not know Me or My Father. If you knew Me, you would know My Father also.”

## John 8:20

He spoke these words while teaching in the temple courts near the place where the offerings were put. Yet no one seized Him, because His time had not yet come.

---

## John 8:21

Again Jesus said to them, “I am going away, and you will look for Me, and you will die in your sin. Where I go, you cannot come.”

## John 8:22

This made the Jews ask, “Will He kill Himself, since He says, ‘Where I go, you cannot come’?”

## John 8:23

But He continued, “You are from the earthly realm; I am from above. You belong to this world; I do not belong to this world.

## John 8:24

I told you that you would die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am He, you will indeed die in your sins.”

## John 8:25

“Who are You?” they asked. “I am exactly who I have been telling you from the beginning,” Jesus replied.

## John 8:26

“I have much to say in judgement of you. But He who sent Me is trustworthy, and what I have heard from Him I tell the world.”

## John 8:27

They did not understand that He was speaking to them about His Father.

## John 8:28

So Jesus said, “When the Father has lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know and understand that I am He - and that I do nothing on My own, but speak only what the Father has taught Me.

## John 8:29

The one who sent Me is with Me; He has not left Me alone, for I always do what is pleasing to Him.”

## John 8:30

As He spoke, many came to believe in Him.

## John 8:31

To the Jews who had believed Him, Jesus said, “If you hold to My teaching, you are truly My disciples.

## John 8:32

Then you will come to know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.”

## John 8:33

They responded, “We are Abraham’s descendants and have never been slaves of anyone. How can you say that we shall be set free?”

## John 8:34

Jesus replied, “Truly, truly I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin.

## John 8:35

Now a slave does not have a permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it forever.

## John 8:36

So if the Son liberates you, you will be truly free.

## John 8:37

I know that you are Abraham’s descendants. Yet you are looking for a way to kill Me, because My word has no place in you.

## John 8:38

I am sharing with you what I have seen in the Father’s presence, and you are doing what you have heard from your father.”

---

## John 8:39

“Abraham is our father,” they answered. “If you were truly Abraham’s children,” said Jesus, “then you would do what Abraham did.

## John 8:40

As it is, you are seeking to kill Me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do such things.

## John 8:41

You are following the ways of your own father.” “We are not illegitimate children,” they protested. “The only Father we have is God Himself.”

## John 8:42

Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love Me, for I have come from God. I have not come on My own; God sent Me.

## John 8:43

Why is My language not clear to you? It is because you are unable to hear what I say.

## John 8:44

You belong to your father, the devil, and you wish to carry out your father’s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.

## John 8:45

Yet because I speak the truth, you do not believe Me!

## John 8:46

Can any of you prove Me guilty of sin? If I am telling the truth, why do you not believe Me?

## John 8:47

Whoever is of God hears the words of God. The reason you do not hear is that you are not of God.”

---

## John 8:48

The Jews answered Him, “Aren’t we right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?”

## John 8:49

“I am not under the influence of a demon,” said Jesus, “but I honour My Father and you dishonour Me.

## John 8:50

But I do not seek my own glory; because there is one who does seek it, and He is the judge.

## John 8:51

Truly, truly I tell you, whoever obeys My word will never see death.”

## John 8:52

At this they exclaimed, “Now we know that you have a demon! Abraham died and so did the prophets, yet you say that whoever obeys your word will never taste death.

## John 8:53

Are you more important than our father Abraham? Even he passed away and died, and so did all the prophets. So who do you claim to be?”

## John 8:54

Jesus replied, “If I glorify Myself, My glory means nothing. It is my Father, whom you claim as your God, who glorifies Me.

## John 8:55

Though you do not know Him, I know Him. If I said I did not, I would be untruthful like you, but I do know Him and I obey His word.

## John 8:56

Your father Abraham was overjoyed at the prospect of seeing My day; he saw it and was glad.”

## John 8:57

“You are not even fifty years old,” they said to Him, “and say you have seen Abraham!”

## John 8:58

“Truly, truly I tell you,” Jesus answered, “before Abraham was born, I am!”

## John 8:59

At this, they picked up stones to throw at Him, but Jesus hid Himself, slipping away from the temple grounds.
