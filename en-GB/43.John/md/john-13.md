# John Chapter 13

## John 13:1

Now before the Feast of the Passover, Jesus, knowing that His hour had come that He would depart from this world to the Father,  
having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the end.

## John 13:2

And during supper, the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to betray Him,

## John 13:3

Jesus, knowing that the Father had handed all things over to Him,  
and that He had come forth from God and was going back to God,

## John 13:4

_got up_ from supper and _laid His outer garments aside_; and He took a towel and tied it around Himself.

## John 13:5

Then He _poured water into the basin_, and began washing the disciples’ feet and wiping them with the towel which He had tied around Himself.

---

## John 13:6

So He _came_ to Simon Peter. He _said to Him_, “Lord, You are washing my feet?”

## John 13:7

Jesus answered and said to him,  
“What I am doing, you do not realise right now, but you will understand later.”

## John 13:8

Peter _said to Him_, “Never shall You wash my feet!”  
Jesus answered him,  
“If I do not wash you, you have no place with Me.”

## John 13:9

Simon Peter _said to Him_,  
“Lord, then wash not only my feet, but also my hands and my head!”

## John 13:10

Jesus _said to him_,  
“He who has bathed needs only to wash his feet; otherwise he is completely clean.  
And you are clean—but not all of you.”

## John 13:11

For He knew the one who was betraying Him; this is why He said, “Not all of you are clean.”

---

## John 13:12

Then, when He had washed their feet, and taken His garments and reclined at the table again,  
He _said to them_,  
“Do you know what I have done for you?

## John 13:13

You call Me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord’; and you are correct, for so I am.

## John 13:14

So if I, the Lord and the Teacher, washed your feet,  
you also ought to wash one another’s feet.

## John 13:15

For I gave you an example, so that you also would do just as I did for you.

## John 13:16

Truly, truly I say to you,  
a slave is not greater than his master, nor is one who is sent greater than the one who sent him.

## John 13:17

If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them.

---

## John 13:18

I am not speaking about all of you.  
I know the ones whom I have chosen; but this is happening so that the Scripture may be fulfilled:  
‘He who eats My bread has lifted up his heel against Me.’

## John 13:19

From now on I am telling you before it happens,  
so that when it does happen, you may believe that I am He.

## John 13:20

Truly, truly I say to you,  
the one who receives anyone I send receives Me;  
and the one who receives Me receives Him who sent Me.”

---

## John 13:21

When Jesus had said these things, He became troubled in spirit,  
and testified and said,  
“Truly, truly I say to you that one of you will betray Me.”

## John 13:22

The disciples began looking at one another, at a loss to know of which one He was speaking.

## John 13:23

Lying back on Jesus’ chest was one of His disciples, whom Jesus loved.

## John 13:24

So Simon Peter _nodded to this disciple_ and _said to him_, “Tell us who it is of whom He is speaking.”

## John 13:25

He then simply leaned back on Jesus’ chest and _said to Him_, “Lord, who is it?”

## John 13:26

Jesus then _answered_,  
“That man is the one for whom I shall dip the piece of bread and give it to him.”  
So when He had dipped the piece of bread, He _took and gave it to Judas_, the son of Simon Iscariot.

## John 13:27

After this, Satan then entered him.  
Therefore Jesus _said to him_, “What you are doing, do it quickly.”

## John 13:28

Now none of those reclining at the table knew for what purpose He had said this to him.

## John 13:29

For some were assuming, since Judas had the money box, that Jesus was saying to him,  
“Buy the things we need for the feast”; or else, that he was to give something to the poor.

## John 13:30

So after receiving the piece of bread, he left immediately; and it was night.

---

## John 13:31

Therefore, when he had left, Jesus _said_,  
“Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in Him;

## John 13:32

if God is glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself, and will glorify Him immediately.

## John 13:33

Little children, I am still with you a little longer.  
You will look for Me; and just as I said to the Jews, now I also say to you:  
‘Where I am going, you cannot come.’

## John 13:34

I am giving you a new commandment, that you love one another;  
just as I have loved you, that you also love one another.

## John 13:35

By this all people will know that you are My disciples: if you have love for one another.”

---

## John 13:36

Simon Peter _said to Him_,  
“Lord, where are You going?”  
Jesus answered,  
“Where I am going, you cannot follow Me now; but you will follow later.”

## John 13:37

Peter _said to Him_,  
“Lord, why can I not follow You right now? I will lay down my life for You!”

## John 13:38

Jesus _replied_,  
“Will you lay down your life for Me?  
Truly, truly I say to you, a rooster will not crow until you deny Me three times.”
