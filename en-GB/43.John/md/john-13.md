# John Chapter 13

## John 13:1

Before the Feast of the Passover, Jesus knew that His hour had come to depart from this world to the Father. Having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the very end.

## John 13:2

During the evening meal, the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to betray Him.

## John 13:3

Jesus, aware that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He had come from God and was returning to God,

## John 13:4

rose from the meal, laid aside His outer garments, and took a towel, tying it around His waist.

## John 13:5

He then poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet, drying them with the towel wrapped around Him.

---

## John 13:6

He approached Simon Peter, who asked Him, “Lord, do You intend to wash my feet?”

## John 13:7

Jesus replied, “You do not understand now what I am doing, but you will understand later.”

## John 13:8

Peter said to Him, “You shall never wash my feet!” Jesus answered, “If I do not wash you, you have no part with Me.”

## John 13:9

Simon Peter said to Him, “Lord, wash not only my feet, but also my hands and my head!”

## John 13:10

Jesus said, “He who has bathed needs only to wash his feet; he is completely clean. And you are clean, but not all of you.”

## John 13:11

For He knew who was going to betray Him; for this reason He said, “Not all of you are clean.”

---

## John 13:12

After washing their feet, He put on His garments and reclined at the table again. He said to them, “Do you understand what I have done for you?

## John 13:13

You refer to Me as ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord’, and you are right, for that is what I am.

## John 13:14

If I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet.

## John 13:15

I have provided you with an example, so that you should do as I have done for you.

## John 13:16

Truly, truly I say to you, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him.

## John 13:17

If you know these things, you will be blessed when you do them.

---

## John 13:18

I am not speaking about all of you. I know whom I have chosen. But this is to fulfil the Scripture: ‘He who eats My bread has lifted up his heel against Me.’

## John 13:19

I am telling you now before it happens, so that when it does happen, you may believe that I am He.

## John 13:20

Truly, truly I say to you, whoever receives anyone I send receives Me; and whoever receives Me receives Him who sent Me.”

---

## John 13:21

After saying this, Jesus was troubled in spirit and testified, “Truly, truly I say to you, one of you will betray Me.”

## John 13:22

The disciples looked at each other, unsure of whom He was referring to.

## John 13:23

One of His disciples, whom Jesus loved, was reclining next to Him.

## John 13:24

Simon Peter motioned to this disciple and said, “Ask Him who it is He means.”

## John 13:25

Leaning back against Jesus, he asked, “Lord, who is it?”

## John 13:26

Jesus answered, “It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread after I have dipped it.” Then, after dipping the piece of bread, He gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.

## John 13:27

After Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him, “What you are about to do, do quickly.”

## John 13:28

None of those at the meal understood why He said this to him.

## John 13:29

Some thought that, since Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the festival, or to give something to the poor.

## John 13:30

After receiving the piece of bread, Judas went out immediately. And it was night.

---

## John 13:31

After he had gone out, Jesus said, “Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified in Him.

## John 13:32

If God is honoured in Him, God will also honour Him in Himself, and will do so immediately.

## John 13:33

Little children, I am with you only a little longer. You will look for Me, and just as I told the Jews, now I tell you: Where I am going, you cannot come.

## John 13:34

A new commandment I give to you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.

## John 13:35

It is by this, therefore, that everyone will know you are My disciples: that you have love for one another.”

---

## John 13:36

Simon Peter said to Him, “Lord, where are You going?” Jesus replied, “Where I am going, you cannot follow Me now, but you will follow later.”

## John 13:37

Peter said to Him, “Lord, why can’t I follow You now? I will lay down my life for You.”

## John 13:38

Jesus replied, “Will you really lay down your life for Me? Truly, truly I say to you, before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.”
