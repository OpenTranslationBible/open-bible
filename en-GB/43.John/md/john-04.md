# John Chapter 4

## John 4:1

When Jesus became aware that the Pharisees had heard He was making and baptising more disciples than John—

## John 4:2

although it was not Jesus Himself who baptised, but His disciples—

## John 4:3

He departed from Judea and returned once more to Galilee.

## John 4:4

He needed to pass through Samaria.

## John 4:5

So He arrived at a town in Samaria named Sychar, near the land Jacob gave to his son Joseph.

## John 4:6

Jacob’s well was there, and Jesus, weary from His journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.

## John 4:7

A Samaritan woman approached to draw water, and Jesus said to her, “Please give me a drink.”

## John 4:8

(His disciples had gone into the town to buy provisions.)

## John 4:9

The Samaritan woman said to Him, “How can You, a Jew, ask me, a Samaritan woman, for a drink?” (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.)

## John 4:10

Jesus replied to her, “If you were aware of the gift of God and who it is that is asking you for a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have provided you with living water.”

## John 4:11

The woman said to Him, “Sir, You have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where then can You get this living water?

## John 4:12

Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, along with his sons and livestock?”

## John 4:13

Jesus replied, “Everyone who drinks this water will thirst again,

## John 4:14

but whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life.”

## John 4:15

The woman said to Him, “Sir, give me this water so that I will not get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water.”

## John 4:16

He instructed her, “Go, call your husband and return.”

## John 4:17

“I have no husband,” she replied. Jesus said to her, “You are correct when you say you have no husband.

## John 4:18

You have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have said is true.”

## John 4:19

The woman said to Him, “Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet.

## John 4:20

Our ancestors worshipped on this mountain, but you Jews say that the place where we must worship is in Jerusalem.”

## John 4:21

Jesus said to her, “Believe me, woman, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.

## John 4:22

You Samaritans worship what you do not understand; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.

## John 4:23

Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for they are the kind of worshippers the Father seeks.

## John 4:24

God is spirit, and His worshippers must worship in spirit and truth.”

## John 4:25

The woman said, “I know that the Messiah” (called Christ) “is coming. When He comes, He will explain everything to us.”

## John 4:26

Then Jesus declared, “I, the one speaking to you — I am He.”

## John 4:27

At that moment His disciples returned and were surprised to find Him talking with a woman. But no one asked, “What do You want?” or “Why are You talking with her?”

## John 4:28

The woman left her water jar and went back to the town, telling the people,

## John 4:29

“Come, see a man who has told me everything I have ever done. Could this be the Messiah?”

## John 4:30

They left the town and made their way towards Him.

---

## John 4:31

Meanwhile His disciples urged Him, “Rabbi, please eat something.”

## John 4:32

But He said to them, “I have food to eat that you do not know about.”

## John 4:33

Upon hearing this, His disciples wondered among themselves, “Could someone have brought Him food?”

## John 4:34

“My food,” said Jesus, “is to do the will of the One who sent Me and to complete His work.

## John 4:35

Do you not say, ‘It’s still four months until harvest’? I tell you, open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest.

## John 4:36

Even now the one who reaps draws a wage and gathers fruit for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together.

## John 4:37

Thus the saying ‘One sows and another reaps’ holds true.

## John 4:38

I sent you to reap what you have not worked for. Others have done the hard work, and you have benefited from their labour.”

---

## John 4:39

Many of the Samaritans from that town came to believe in Him because of the woman’s testimony, “He told me everything I ever did.”

## John 4:40

So when the Samaritans came to Him, they urged Him to stay with them, and He remained for two days.

## John 4:41

And through His words, many more came to believe.

## John 4:42

They said to the woman, “We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man truly is the Saviour of the world.”

---

## John 4:43

After the two days, He set out for Galilee.

## John 4:44

For Jesus Himself had testified that a prophet has no honour in his own country.

## John 4:45

When He arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed Him, having seen all that He had done in Jerusalem at the feast, for they also had been there.

---

## John 4:46

Once more He visited Cana in Galilee, where He had turned the water into wine. And there was a royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum.

## John 4:47

When this man heard that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judea, he went to Him and pleaded with Him to come and heal his son, who was close to death.

## John 4:48

Then Jesus said to him, “Unless you people see signs and wonders, you will never believe.”

## John 4:49

The royal official implored, “Sir, come down before my child dies.”

## John 4:50

Jesus said to him, “Go; your son will live.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and departed.

## John 4:51

As he was on his way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was living.

## John 4:52

He inquired of them the hour when his son got better, and they said to him, “Yesterday at one in the afternoon the fever left him.”

## John 4:53

Then the father realised this was the precise moment Jesus had told him, “Your son will live.” So he and his entire household came to believe.

## John 4:54

This was the second miraculous sign Jesus performed after coming from Judea to Galilee.
