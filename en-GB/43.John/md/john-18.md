# John Chapter 18

## John 18:1

After Jesus had finished speaking, He went with His disciples across the Kidron Valley, where there was a garden into which He and His disciples entered.

## John 18:2

Now Judas, who was betraying Him, also knew the place, because Jesus had frequently met there with His disciples.

## John 18:3

So Judas, having procured a detachment of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.

## John 18:4

Jesus, aware of all that was coming upon Him, went forward and asked them, “Whom are you seeking?”

## John 18:5

They answered Him, “Jesus of Nazareth.” Jesus said to them, “I am He.” Judas, who was betraying Him, was also standing with them.

## John 18:6

When Jesus said, “I am He,” they drew back and fell to the ground.

## John 18:7

He asked them again, “Whom are you seeking?” They said, “Jesus of Nazareth.”

## John 18:8

Jesus replied, “I told you that I am He. If you are looking for Me, then let these men go.”

## John 18:9

This occurred to fulfil the words He had spoken: “Of those You have given Me, I have lost not one.”

## John 18:10

Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest’s servant, cutting off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus.

## John 18:11

Jesus said to Peter, “Put your sword back into its sheath. Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given Me?”

## John 18:12

Then the detachment of soldiers, along with their commander and the Jewish officials, arrested Jesus and bound Him.

## John 18:13

They led Him first to Annas, who was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year.

## John 18:14

Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jewish leaders that it would be advantageous for one man to die for the people.

## John 18:15

Simon Peter followed Jesus, along with another disciple. This disciple was known to the high priest and went with Jesus into the high priest’s courtyard,

## John 18:16

but Peter stood outside at the door. The other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the servant girl who kept the door, and brought Peter in.

## John 18:17

The servant girl at the door asked Peter, “You are not also one of this man’s disciples, are you?” He said, “I am not.”

## John 18:18

It was cold, and the servants and officers stood around a charcoal fire they had made to keep warm. Peter was also with them, standing and warming himself.

## John 18:19

The high priest then questioned Jesus about His disciples and His teaching.

## John 18:20

Jesus answered, “I have spoken openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all the Jews gather. I have said nothing in secret.

## John 18:21

Why do you question Me? Ask those who have heard Me. Surely they know what I said.”

## John 18:22

When He said this, one of the officers standing nearby struck Jesus, saying, “Is that how You answer the high priest?”

## John 18:23

Jesus replied, “If I have spoken wrongly, testify to the wrong; but if rightly, why do you strike Me?”

## John 18:24

Then Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.

---

## John 18:25

Meanwhile, Simon Peter was still standing and warming himself. So they asked him, “You are not one of His disciples as well, are you?” He denied it, saying, “I am not.”

## John 18:26

One of the high priest’s servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, said, “Did I not see you in the garden with Him?”

## John 18:27

Peter denied it again, and immediately a rooster crowed.

---

## John 18:28

Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the Praetorium. It was early, and they themselves did not enter the Praetorium to avoid ceremonial defilement, so that they might eat the Passover.

## John 18:29

Pilate therefore went out to them and asked, “What accusation do you bring against this man?”

## John 18:30

They answered, “If He were not a criminal, we would not have handed Him over to you.”

## John 18:31

Pilate said, “Take Him yourselves and judge Him by your own law.” The Jews said, “We are not permitted to execute anyone.”

## John 18:32

This happened to fulfil the word Jesus had spoken, indicating the kind of death He was going to die.

---

## John 18:33

Pilate then went back inside the Praetorium, summoned Jesus, and asked Him, “Are you the King of the Jews?”

## John 18:34

Jesus answered, “Is that your own idea, or have others spoken to you about Me?”

## John 18:35

Pilate replied, “Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have handed You over to me. What have You done?”

## John 18:36

Jesus said, “My kingdom is not of this world. If it were, My servants would fight to prevent My arrest by the Jewish leaders. But now My kingdom is from another place.”

## John 18:37

“You are a king, then!” said Pilate. Jesus answered, “You say that I am a king. For this reason I was born and came into the world: to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to My voice.”

## John 18:38

Pilate said to Him, “What is truth?” With this he went out again to the Jews gathered there and said, “I find no basis for a charge against Him.

## John 18:39

But it is your custom for me to release one prisoner to you at the Passover. Do you want me to release ‘the King of the Jews’?”

## John 18:40

They shouted back, “Not this man, but Barabbas!” Now Barabbas was a rebel.
