# John Chapter 18

## John 18:1

When Jesus had spoken these words, He went away with His disciples across the Kidron Valley,  
where there was a garden which He and His disciples entered.

## John 18:2

Now Judas, who was betraying Him, also knew the place, because Jesus had often met there with His disciples.

## John 18:3

So Judas, having obtained the Roman cohort and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees,  
_came there_ with lanterns, torches, and weapons.

## John 18:4

Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were coming upon Him,  
came out into the open and _said to them_, “Whom are you seeking?”

## John 18:5

They answered Him, “Jesus the Nazarene.”  
He _said to them_, “I am He.”  
And Judas also, who was betraying Him, was standing with them.

## John 18:6

Now then, when He said to them, “I am He,” they drew back and fell to the ground.

## John 18:7

He then asked them again, “Whom are you seeking?”  
And they said, “Jesus the Nazarene.”

## John 18:8

Jesus answered, “I told you that I am He; so if you are seeking Me, let these men go on their way.”

## John 18:9

This took place so that the word which He spoke would be fulfilled:  
“Of those whom You have given Me I lost not one.”

## John 18:10

Then Simon Peter, since he had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest’s slave,  
and cut off his right ear; and the slave’s name was Malchus.

## John 18:11

So Jesus said to Peter,  
“Put the sword into the sheath; the cup which the Father has given Me, am I not to drink it?”

## John 18:12

So the Roman cohort, the commander, and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound Him,

## John 18:13

and brought Him first to Annas; for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.

## John 18:14

Now it was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it was in their best interest for one man to die on behalf of the people.

## John 18:15

Simon Peter was following Jesus, and so was another disciple.  
Now that disciple was known to the high priest,  
and he entered with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest,

## John 18:16

but Peter was standing at the door outside.  
So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the doorkeeper, and brought Peter in.

## John 18:17

Then the slave woman who was the doorkeeper _said to Peter_,  
“You are not also one of this Man’s disciples, are you?”  
He _said_, “I am not.”

## John 18:18

Now the slaves and the officers were standing there, having made a charcoal fire, for it was cold and they were warming themselves;  
and Peter was also with them, standing and warming himself.

## John 18:19

The high priest then questioned Jesus about His disciples, and about His teaching.

## John 18:20

Jesus answered him,  
“I have spoken openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues and in the temple area,  
where all the Jews congregate; and I said nothing in secret.

## John 18:21

Why are you asking Me? Ask those who have heard what I spoke to them.  
Look, these people know what I said.”

## John 18:22

But when He said this, one of the officers, who was standing nearby, struck Jesus, saying,  
“Is that the way You answer the high priest?”

## John 18:23

Jesus answered him,  
“If I have spoken wrongly, testify of the wrong; but if rightly, why do you strike Me?”

## John 18:24

So Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.

---

## John 18:25

Now Simon Peter was still standing and warming himself. So they said to him,  
“You are not one of His disciples as well, are you?”  
He denied it, and said, “I am not.”

## John 18:26

One of the slaves of the high priest, who was related to the one whose ear Peter had cut off, _said_,  
“Did I not see you in the garden with Him?”

## John 18:27

Peter then denied it again, and immediately a rooster crowed.

---

## John 18:28

Then they _brought Jesus_ from Caiaphas into the Praetorium, and it was early;  
and they themselves did not enter the Praetorium, so that they would not be defiled, but might eat the Passover.

## John 18:29

Therefore Pilate came out to them and _said_, “What accusation are you bringing against this Man?”

## John 18:30

They answered and said to him,  
“If this Man were not a criminal, we would not have handed Him over to you.”

## John 18:31

So Pilate said to them,  
“Take Him yourselves, and judge Him according to your law!”  
The Jews said to him,  
“It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death.”

## John 18:32

This happened so that the word of Jesus which He said, indicating what kind of death He was going to die, would be fulfilled.

---

## John 18:33

Therefore Pilate entered the Praetorium again, and summoned Jesus and said to Him,  
“You are the King of the Jews?”

## John 18:34

Jesus answered,  
“Are you saying this on your own, or did others tell you about Me?”

## John 18:35

Pilate answered,  
“I am not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests handed You over to me; what have You done?”

## John 18:36

Jesus answered,  
“My kingdom is not of this world. If My kingdom were of this world,  
My servants would be fighting so that I would not be handed over to the Jews;  
but as it is, My kingdom is not of this realm.”

## John 18:37

Therefore Pilate said to Him,  
“So You are a king?”  
Jesus answered,  
“You say correctly that I am a king. For this purpose I have been born, and for this I have come into the world:  
to testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to My voice.”

## John 18:38

Pilate _said to Him_, “What is truth?”  
And after saying this, he came out again to the Jews and _said to them_,  
“I find no grounds at all for charges in His case.

## John 18:39

However, you have a custom that I release one prisoner for you at the Passover;  
therefore do you wish that I release for you the King of the Jews?”

## John 18:40

So they shouted again, saying,  
“Not this Man, but Barabbas!”  
Now Barabbas was a rebel.
