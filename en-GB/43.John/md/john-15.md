# John Chapter 15

## John 15:1

“I am the true vine, and my Father tends it.

## John 15:2

He removes every branch in me that does not bear fruit, and every branch that does bear fruit, he prunes so that it may be more fruitful.

## John 15:3

You are made clean by of the word I have spoken to you.

## John 15:4

Remain in me, and I will remain in you. Just as a branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it remains in the vine, neither can you unless you remain in me.

## John 15:5

I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever remains in me and I in them will bear much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.

## John 15:6

If anyone does not remain in me, they are like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned.

## John 15:7

If you stay in me and my words stay in you, ask for whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.

## John 15:8

By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and thus prove to be my disciples.

## John 15:9

Just as the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Stay in my love.

## John 15:10

If you follow my commandments, you will stay in my love, just as I have followed my Father’s commandments and stay in his love.

## John 15:11

I have spoken these things to you so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete.

---

## John 15:12

For this is my command: that you love one another as I have loved you.

## John 15:13

There is no greater love than this: to give up one’s life for one’s friends.

## John 15:14

You are my friends when you do what I command.

## John 15:15

I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know what his master is doing. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything I have learned from my Father I have made known to you.

## John 15:16

You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit—fruit that will last—so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give you.

## John 15:17

This is my command: love one another.

---

## John 15:18

If the world hates you, remember that it hated me before it hated you.

## John 15:19

If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own. But because you are not of the world, and I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.

## John 15:20

Remember the word I said to you: ‘A servant is not greater than his master.’ If they persecuted me, they will persecute you as well; if they obeyed my word, they will obey yours also.

## John 15:21

They will do all these things to you because of my name, as they do not know the one who sent me.

## John 15:22

If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not know of their sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.

## John 15:23

Whoever hates me detests my Father also.

## John 15:24

If I had not done the works which no other man has done among them, they would not know of their sin; but now they have seen they hate both me and my Father.

## John 15:25

This is to fulfil what is written in their Law: ‘They hated me without reason.’

---

## John 15:26

When the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, he will testify about me.

## John 15:27

And you also must testify, because you have been with me from the beginning.
