# John Chapter 15

## John 15:1

“I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser.

## John 15:2

He removes every branch in me that does not bear fruit, and every branch that does bear fruit, he prunes so that it may be more fruitful.

## John 15:3

You are already clean because of the word I have spoken to you.

## John 15:4

Remain in me, and I will remain in you. Just as a branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it remains in the vine, neither can you unless you remain in me.

## John 15:5

I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever remains in me and I in them will bear much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.

## John 15:6

If anyone does not remain in me, they are like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned.

## John 15:7

If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.

## John 15:8

By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and thus prove to be my disciples.

## John 15:9

As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Remain in my love.

## John 15:10

If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love, just as I have kept my Father’s commandments and remain in his love.

## John 15:11

I have spoken these things to you so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete.

---

## John 15:12

This is my commandment: that you love one another as I have loved you.

## John 15:13

Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.

## John 15:14

You are my friends if you do what I command.

## John 15:15

I no longer call you servants, because a servant does not know what his master is doing. Instead, I have called you friends, for everything I have learned from my Father I have made known to you.

## John 15:16

You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit—fruit that will last—so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give you.

## John 15:17

This is my command: love one another.

---

## John 15:18

If the world hates you, know that it hated me before it hated you.

## John 15:19

If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own. But because you are not of the world, and I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.

## John 15:20

Remember the word I said to you: ‘A servant is not greater than his master.’ If they persecuted me, they will persecute you as well; if they obeyed my word, they will obey yours also.

## John 15:21

They will do all these things to you on account of my name, because they do not know the one who sent me.

## John 15:22

If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.

## John 15:23

Whoever hates me hates my Father also.

## John 15:24

If I had not done among them the works which no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin; but now they have seen and hated both me and my Father.

## John 15:25

This is to fulfil what is written in their Law: ‘They hated me without reason.’

---

## John 15:26

When the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, he will testify about me.

## John 15:27

And you also must testify, because you have been with me from the beginning.
