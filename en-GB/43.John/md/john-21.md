# John Chapter 21

## John 21:1

After these events, Jesus manifested Himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias, and He did so in this manner:

## John 21:2

Simon Peter, Thomas called Didymus, Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples were together.

## John 21:3

Simon Peter said to them, “I am going fishing.” They replied, “We will come with you.” So they went out and boarded the boat, but that night they caught nothing.

## John 21:4

As dawn was breaking, Jesus stood on the shore, yet the disciples did not recognise that it was Jesus.

## John 21:5

Jesus called out to them, “Children, have you any fish?” They answered, “No.”

## John 21:6

He instructed them, “Cast your net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.” They cast it, and were unable to haul it in due to the large quantity of fish.

## John 21:7

Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” When Simon Peter heard this, he put on his outer garment (for he was stripped for work) and plunged into the sea.

## John 21:8

The other disciples followed in the little boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from land, about two hundred cubits.

## John 21:9

Upon reaching land, they saw a charcoal fire with fish laid upon it, and bread.

## John 21:10

Jesus instructed them, “Bring in those fish you have just caught.”

## John 21:11

Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore, full of large fish, 153 in total; and despite their number, the net was not torn.

## John 21:12

Jesus said to them, “Come and have breakfast.” None of the disciples dared to ask Him, “Who are you?” knowing it was the Lord.

## John 21:13

Jesus approached, took the bread, and distributed it to them, and likewise with the fish.

## John 21:14

This was now the third occasion that Jesus appeared to the disciples after being raised from the dead.

## John 21:15

After they had eaten, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?” He replied, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.” Jesus said, “Feed my lambs.”

## John 21:16

He asked him again, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” He answered, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.” Jesus said, “Tend my sheep.”

## John 21:17

He asked him a third time, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” Peter was distressed because Jesus asked him the third time, “Do you love me?” He said, “Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you.” Jesus said, “Feed my sheep.

## John 21:18

Truly, truly I say to you, when you were younger, you dressed yourself and went wherever you wished; but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will dress you and take you where you do not wish to go.”

## John 21:19

He said this to signify the kind of death by which Peter would glorify God. After saying this, He said to him, “Follow me!”

## John 21:20

Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them, the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and asked, “Lord, who is going to betray you?”

## John 21:21

Seeing him, Peter asked Jesus, “Lord, what about this man?”

## John 21:22

Jesus replied, “If I want him to remain until I return, what is that to you? You must follow me.”

## John 21:23

Thus the rumour spread among the brothers that this disciple would not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but only, “If I want him to remain until I return, what is that to you?”

## John 21:24

This is the disciple who bears witness to these things and who wrote them down. We know that his testimony is true.

## John 21:25

There are many other things that Jesus did; if every one were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.
