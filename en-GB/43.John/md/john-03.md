# John Chapter 3

## John 3:1

Now there was a Pharisee named Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish ruling council.

## John 3:2

He came to Jesus by night and said to Him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God; for no one can perform these signs you are doing unless God is with him.”

## John 3:3

Jesus replied, “Truly, truly, I say to you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born anew.”

## John 3:4

Nicodemus asked, “How can someone be born when they are old? Surely they cannot enter their mother’s womb a second time to be born!”

## John 3:5

Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, they cannot enter the kingdom of God.

## John 3:6

Whatever is born of the flesh is flesh, and whatever is born of the Spirit is spirit.

## John 3:7

Do not be amazed that I said to you, ‘You must experience a new birth.’

## John 3:8

The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.”

## John 3:9

“How is this possible?” Nicodemus inquired.

## John 3:10

Jesus replied, “You are Israel’s teacher, and do you not understand these things?

## John 3:11

Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know, and we testify to what we have seen, but you do not accept our testimony.

## John 3:12

If I have spoken to you of earthly matters and you do not believe, how will you believe if I speak of heavenly matters?

## John 3:13

No one has gone up to heaven except the One who came down from heaven—the Son of Man.

## John 3:14

Just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be elevated,

## John 3:15

so that everyone who believes may have eternal life through Him.

---

## John 3:16

For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.

## John 3:17

For God did not send His Son into the world to pass judgement on the world, but to bring salvation to the world through Him.

## John 3:18

Whoever believes in Him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s only Son.

## John 3:19

This is the judgement: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil.

## John 3:20

Those who do evil avoid the light, fearing their deeds will be revealed.

## John 3:21

But whoever practices the truth comes into the light, so that it may be evident that what they have done has been done in the sight of God.

## John 3:22

After this, Jesus and His disciples went into the Judean countryside, where He spent some time with them and baptised.

## John 3:23

Now John was also baptising at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water, and people were coming and being baptised.

## John 3:24

(This occurred before John was imprisoned.)

---

## John 3:25

An argument arose between some of John’s disciples and a certain Jew over ceremonial washing.

## John 3:26

They came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, that man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, the one you testified about, look, He is baptising, and everyone is going to Him.”

## John 3:27

John replied, “A person can receive only what is given them from heaven.

## John 3:28

You can confirm that I said, ‘I am not the Messiah but am sent ahead of Him.’

## John 3:29

The bride belongs to the bridegroom. The friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him and is filled with joy when he hears the bridegroom’s voice. That joy is mine, and it is now complete.

## John 3:30

He must increase and become greater, while I must decrease.

---

## John 3:31

The one who comes from above is supreme; the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks from an earthly perspective. The one who comes from heaven is supreme.

## John 3:32

He bears witness to what He has seen and heard, but His testimony is not accepted by anyone.

## John 3:33

Whoever has accepted His testimony has certified that God is truthful.

## John 3:34

For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without measure.

## John 3:35

The Father loves the Son and has entrusted everything to His hands.

## John 3:36

Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God’s displeasure remains on them.
