# 1 Peter Chapter 1

## 1 Peter 1:1

From Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ,  
To those living as strangers, dispersed throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, who have been chosen

## 1 Peter 1:2

in accordance with the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, to obey Jesus Christ and be cleansed by His blood:  
May grace and peace be abundantly yours.

## 1 Peter 1:3

Praised be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who in His great mercy has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,

## 1 Peter 1:4

to receive an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you,

## 1 Peter 1:5

who, through faith, are safeguarded by the power of God for a salvation that is ready to be revealed at the last time.

## 1 Peter 1:6

In this you greatly rejoice, even though now for a short time, if necessary, you have been troubled by various trials,

## 1 Peter 1:7

so that the proof of your faith, being more precious than gold which perishes though tested by fire, may be found to result in praise, glory, and honour at the revelation of Jesus Christ;

## 1 Peter 1:8

and though you have not seen Him, you love Him, and though you do not see Him now, but believe in Him, you greatly rejoice with joy beyond words and full of glory,

## 1 Peter 1:9

obtaining the salvation of your souls as the result of your faith.

## 1 Peter 1:10

Concerning this salvation, the prophets who foretold the grace that was to come to you made careful searches and inquiries,

## 1 Peter 1:11

seeking to know what time or what kind of time the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating as He predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow.

## 1 Peter 1:12

It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves, but you, in these matters which now have been announced to you through those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven—things into which angels long to look.

## 1 Peter 1:13

Therefore, prepare your minds for action, remain sober in spirit, set your hope fully on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.

## 1 Peter 1:14

As obedient children, do not conform to the former desires that were yours in your ignorance,

## 1 Peter 1:15

but like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves also in all your behaviour;

## 1 Peter 1:16

for it is stated: “You shall be holy, for I am holy.”

## 1 Peter 1:17

If you call upon as Father the One who impartially judges according to each one’s work, conduct yourselves in reverence during the time of your stay on earth;

## 1 Peter 1:18

realising that you were not redeemed with perishable things like silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your ancestors,

## 1 Peter 1:19

but with precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and spotless, the blood of Christ.

## 1 Peter 1:20

For He was known before the foundation of the world, but has appeared in these last times for your sake

## 1 Peter 1:21

Through Him you have come to believe in God, who raised Him from the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.

## 1 Peter 1:22

Since you have purified your souls by obedience to the truth for a sincere love of the brothers and sisters, love one another earnestly from the heart,

## 1 Peter 1:23

for you have been born again not of perishable seed, but imperishable, through the living and enduring word of God.

## 1 Peter 1:24

For,

> “All humanity is like grass,  
> And all its splendour is like the flower of grass.  
> The grass withers,  
> And the flower falls away,

## 1 Peter 1:25

> But the word of the Lord remains forever.”

And this is the word that was proclaimed to you.
