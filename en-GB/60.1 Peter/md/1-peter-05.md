# 1 Peter Chapter 5

## 1 Peter 5:1

So, I appeal to the elders among you, as a fellow elder and a witness to the sufferings of Christ, and also as one who shares in the glory that is to be revealed:

## 1 Peter 5:2

tend to the flock of God in your care, providing oversight willingly, in accordance with God's will; and not for dishonest gain, but with enthusiasm;

## 1 Peter 5:3

not by lording it over those entrusted to you, but by being examples to the flock.

## 1 Peter 5:4

And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.

## 1 Peter 5:5

You younger men, likewise, be subject to your elders; and all of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because

> “God is opposed to the proud,  
> But gives grace to the humble.”

## 1 Peter 5:6

So humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may lift you up at the right time,

## 1 Peter 5:7

casting all your worries on Him, because He cares for you.

## 1 Peter 5:8

Be alert and vigilant. Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.

## 1 Peter 5:9

Resist him, standing firm in your faith, knowing that your brothers and sisters throughout the world are undergoing the same kinds of suffering.

## 1 Peter 5:10

After you have suffered for a short time, the God of all grace, who called you to His eternal glory in Christ, will Himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you.

## 1 Peter 5:11

To Him be the dominion forever and ever. Amen.

## 1 Peter 5:12

Through Silvanus, our faithful brother (as I consider him), I have written to you briefly, to encourage you and to testify that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it!

## 1 Peter 5:13

The church in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you greetings, and so does my son, Mark.

## 1 Peter 5:14

Greet one another with a kiss of love.  
Peace be to you all who are in Christ.
