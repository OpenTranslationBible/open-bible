# 1 Peter Chapter 5

## 1 Peter 5:1

Therefore, I urge elders among you, as your fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and one who is also a fellow partaker of the glory that is to be revealed:

## 1 Peter 5:2

shepherd the flock of God among you, exercising oversight not under compulsion, but voluntarily, according to the will of God; and not with greed, but with eagerness;

## 1 Peter 5:3

nor yet as domineering over those assigned to your care, but by proving to be examples to the flock.

## 1 Peter 5:4

And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.

## 1 Peter 5:5

You younger men, likewise, be subject to your elders; and all of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because

> “God is opposed to the proud,  
> But gives grace to the humble.”

## 1 Peter 5:6

Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, so that He may exalt you at the proper time,

## 1 Peter 5:7

having cast all your anxiety on Him, because He cares about you.

## 1 Peter 5:8

Be of sober spirit, be on the alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.

## 1 Peter 5:9

So resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your brothers and sisters who are in the world.

## 1 Peter 5:10

After you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who called you to His eternal glory in Christ, will Himself perfect, confirm, strengthen, and establish you.

## 1 Peter 5:11

To Him be dominion forever and ever. Amen.

## 1 Peter 5:12

Through Silvanus, our faithful brother (for so I regard him), I have written to you briefly, to encourage you and to testify that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it!

## 1 Peter 5:13

She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you greetings, and so does my son, Mark.

## 1 Peter 5:14

Greet one another with a kiss of love.  
Peace be to you all who are in Christ.
