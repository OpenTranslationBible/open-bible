# 1 Peter Chapter 2

## 1 Peter 2:1

So, put away all malice, deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and every kind of slander,

## 1 Peter 2:2

and like newborn infants, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation,

## 1 Peter 2:3

if you have experienced the goodness of the Lord.

## 1 Peter 2:4

And as you come to Him, a living stone rejected by people but chosen and precious in God's sight,

## 1 Peter 2:5

you also, like living stones, are being constructed into a spiritual house to become a holy priesthood, presenting spiritual sacrifices that are acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.

## 1 Peter 2:6

For this is contained in Scripture:

> “Behold, I am laying in Zion a choice stone,  
> a precious cornerstone,  
> And the one who believes in Him  
> will not be put to shame.”

## 1 Peter 2:7

This precious value, then, is for you who believe; but for unbelievers,

> “A stone which the builders rejected,  
> This became the chief cornerstone,”

## 1 Peter 2:8

and,

> “A stone of stumbling and a rock of offence”;  
> for they stumble because they are disobedient to the word, and to this they were also appointed.

## 1 Peter 2:9

But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God’s own possession, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvellous light;

## 1 Peter 2:10

for you were once not a people, but now you are the people of God; you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.

## 1 Peter 2:11

Beloved, I urge you, as strangers and pilgrims, to refrain from sinful desires, which wage war against your soul.

## 1 Peter 2:12

Keep your behaviour excellent among the Gentiles, so that in the thing in which they slander you as evildoers, they may because of your good deeds, as they observe them, glorify God on the day of visitation.

## 1 Peter 2:13

Submit yourselves for the Lord’s sake to every human authority, whether to the king as the supreme authority,

## 1 Peter 2:14

or to governors, who are sent by him to bring justice to those who do wrong and to praise those who do right.

## 1 Peter 2:15

For it is God’s will that by doing good you should silence the unwise talk of uninformed people.

## 1 Peter 2:16

Live as free people, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as servants of God.

## 1 Peter 2:17

Honour all people, love the brotherhood, fear God, honour the king.

## 1 Peter 2:18

Servants, submit yourselves to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and gentle, but also to those who are harsh.

## 1 Peter 2:19

For it is praiseworthy if someone endures the pain of unjust suffering because they are mindful of God.

## 1 Peter 2:20

For what credit is there if, when you sin and are harshly treated, you endure it with patience? But if when you do what is right and suffer for it you patiently endure it, this finds favour with God.

## 1 Peter 2:21

For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in His steps,

## 1 Peter 2:22

> He who committed no sin,  
> nor was any deceit found in His mouth;

## 1 Peter 2:23

and while being insulted, He did not retaliate; while suffering, He made no threats, but entrusted Himself to Him who judges justly;

## 1 Peter 2:24

and He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; by His wounds you have been healed.

## 1 Peter 2:25

For you were like sheep that had gone astray, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.
