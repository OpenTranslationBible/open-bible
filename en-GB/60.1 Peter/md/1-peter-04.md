# 1 Peter Chapter 4

## 1 Peter 4:1

Since Christ endured suffering in the flesh, equip yourselves with the same mindset, because whoever has suffered in the flesh has turned away from sin,

## 1 Peter 4:2

so as to live the remaining time in the flesh not for human desires, but for the will of God.

## 1 Peter 4:3

For the time already past is sufficient for you to have carried out the desire of the Gentiles, having pursued a course of indecent behaviour, lusts, drunkenness, carousing, drinking parties, and wanton idolatries.

## 1 Peter 4:4

In all this, they are surprised that you do not join them in the same excesses of debauchery, and they slander you;

## 1 Peter 4:5

but they will have to account to Him who is prepared to judge both the living and the dead.

## 1 Peter 4:6

For the gospel has for this purpose been preached even to those who are dead, so that though they are judged in the flesh as people, they may live in the spirit according to the will of God.

## 1 Peter 4:7

The culmination of all things is near; therefore, be clear-minded and self-controlled for the sake of prayer.

## 1 Peter 4:8

Above all, maintain a fervent love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins.

## 1 Peter 4:9

Extend hospitality to one another willingly and without complaint.

## 1 Peter 4:10

As each one has received a special gift, use it in serving one another as good stewards of the varied grace of God.

## 1 Peter 4:11

Whoever speaks should do so as one speaking the very words of God; whoever serves should do so with the strength God provides, so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belongs the glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.

## 1 Peter 4:12

Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery trial among you, which comes upon you for your testing, as though something unusual were happening to you;

## 1 Peter 4:13

but to the extent that you share in the sufferings of Christ, continue to rejoice, so that at the revelation of His glory you may also rejoice and be filled with joy.

## 1 Peter 4:14

If you are reproached for bearing the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.

## 1 Peter 4:15

Ensure that none of you suffers as a murderer, or thief, or evildoer, or a troublesome meddler;

## 1 Peter 4:16

but if anyone suffers as a Christian, they should not feel ashamed, but should glorify God in this name.

## 1 Peter 4:17

For it is time for judgment to begin with the household of God; and if it starts with us first, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of God?

## 1 Peter 4:18

And

> if it is with difficulty that the righteous is saved,
> what will become of the godless person and the sinner?

## 1 Peter 4:19

Therefore, those who suffer according to the will of God should entrust their souls to a faithful Creator by doing what is right.
