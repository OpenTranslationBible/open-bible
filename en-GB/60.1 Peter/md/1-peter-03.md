# 1 Peter Chapter 3

## 1 Peter 3:1

In the same way, you wives, be subject to your own husbands so that even if any of them are disobedient to the word, they may be won over without a word by the behaviour of their wives,

## 1 Peter 3:2

as they observe your pure and respectful behaviour.

## 1 Peter 3:3

Your adornment must not be the external—braiding the hair, wearing gold jewellery, or putting on apparel;

## 1 Peter 3:4

but let it be the inner self, with the enduring beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is valuable in God's eyes.

## 1 Peter 3:5

For in this manner, the holy women of the past, who placed their hope in God, used to adorn themselves, being supportive to their own husbands,

## 1 Peter 3:6

just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord; and you have become her children if you do what is right without giving way to fear.

## 1 Peter 3:7

You husbands in the same way, live with your wives in an understanding way, as with someone weaker, since she is a woman; and show her honour as a fellow heir of the grace of life, so that your prayers will not be hindered.

## 1 Peter 3:8

Finally, all of you be harmonious, sympathetic, loving, compassionate, and humble;

## 1 Peter 3:9

not returning evil for evil or insult for insult, but offering a blessing instead; for you were called for this very purpose, that you might inherit a blessing.

## 1 Peter 3:10

For,

> “He who would love life  
> and see good days,  
> Must keep their tongue from evil  
> and their lips from speaking deceit.

## 1 Peter 3:11

> They should turn away from evil and do good;  
> They should seek peace and pursue it.

## 1 Peter 3:12

> For the Lord's eyes are upon the righteous,  
> And His ears are attentive to their prayer,  
> But the Lord's face is against those who do evil.”

## 1 Peter 3:13

And who is there to harm you if you are eager to do good?

## 1 Peter 3:14

But even if you should suffer for doing what is right, you are blessed. Do not fear their threats, nor be troubled,

## 1 Peter 3:15

but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, always being ready to make a defence to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you, but with gentleness and respect;

## 1 Peter 3:16

and keep a good conscience so that in the thing in which you are slandered, those who disparage your good behaviour in Christ will be put to shame.

## 1 Peter 3:17

For it is better, if it is God's will, that you suffer for doing good rather than for doing evil.

## 1 Peter 3:18

For Christ also suffered for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive in the spirit;

## 1 Peter 3:19

in which He went and made proclamation to the spirits in confinement,

## 1 Peter 3:20

who were disobedient long ago, when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built. In it only a few people, eight in all, were saved through water.

## 1 Peter 3:21

And this water symbolises baptism that now saves you also—not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a clear conscience toward God. It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ,

## 1 Peter 3:22

who has ascended into heaven and is at the right hand of God—with angels, authorities, and powers made subject to Him.
