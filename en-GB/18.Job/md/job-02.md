# Job Chapter 2

## Job 2:1

On another day, the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came among them to present himself before the Lord.

## Job 2:2

And the Lord said to Satan, “Where have you come from?”

---

Satan answered the Lord, “From roaming throughout the earth and walking back and forth on it.”

---

## Job 2:3

Then the Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one like him on earth; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil. And he still maintains his integrity, though you incited me against him to ruin him without cause.”

## Job 2:4

Satan replied to the Lord, “Skin for skin! Indeed, a man will give all he has for his own life.

## Job 2:5

But now, stretch out your hand and strike his bone and flesh, and he will surely curse you to your face.”

---

## Job 2:6

The Lord said to Satan, “Very well, he is in your hands; only spare his life.”

## Job 2:7

So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord and afflicted Job with painful boils from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head.

## Job 2:8

Then Job took a piece of broken pottery to scrape himself as he sat among the ashes.

## Job 2:9

His wife said to him, “Are you still holding on to your integrity? Renounce God and pass away!”

## Job 2:10

He replied, “You are speaking like one of the foolish women. Shall we accept good from God, and not adversity?” In all this, Job did not sin with his lips.

## Job 2:11

When Job’s three friends, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, heard about all the troubles that had come upon him, they set out from their homes and agreed to meet together to sympathise with him and comfort him.

## Job 2:12

When they saw him from a distance, they could hardly recognise him; they raised their voices and wept aloud, tearing their robes and sprinkling dust on their heads towards the sky.

## Job 2:13

Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights. No one spoke a word to him, because they saw how great his suffering was.
