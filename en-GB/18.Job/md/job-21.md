## Job 21:1

Then Job responded,

## Job 21:2

> “Listen carefully to my speech,  
> And let this be your way of consolation.

## Job 21:3

> Bear with me, and I will speak;  
> Then after I have spoken, you may mock.

---

## Job 21:4

> As for me, is my complaint to a mortal?  
> Or why should I not be impatient?

## Job 21:5

> Look at me, and be astonished,  
> And put your hand over your mouth.

## Job 21:6

> Even when I remember, I am disturbed,  
> And horror takes hold of my flesh.

## Job 21:7

> Why do the wicked still live,  
> Grow old, and also become very powerful?

## Job 21:8

> Their descendants endure with them in their sight,  
> And their offspring before their eyes,

## Job 21:9

> Their houses are safe from fear,  
> And the rod of God is not on them.

## Job 21:10

> His ox mates without fail;  
> His cow calves and does not miscarry.

## Job 21:11

> They send out their boys like the flock,  
> And their children skip about.

## Job 21:12

> They sing to the tambourine and harp,  
> And rejoice at the sound of the flute.

## Job 21:13

> They spend their days in prosperity,  
> And suddenly they go down to Sheol.

## Job 21:14

> Yet they say to God, ‘Go away from us!  
> We do not desire the knowledge of Your ways.

## Job 21:15

> Who is the Almighty, that we should serve Him,  
> And what would we gain if we plead with Him?’

## Job 21:16

> Behold, their prosperity is not in their hand;  
> The advice of the wicked is far from me.

## Job 21:17

> How often is the lamp of the wicked put out,  
> Or does their disaster fall on them?  
> Does God apportion destruction in His anger?

## Job 21:18

> Are they as straw before the wind,  
> And like chaff which the storm carries away?

## Job 21:19

> You say, ‘God stores up a man’s wrongdoing for his sons.’  
> Let God repay him so that he may know it.

## Job 21:20

> Let his own eyes see his destruction,  
> And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.

## Job 21:21

> For what does he care about his household after him,  
> When the number of his months is at an end?

---

## Job 21:22

> Can anyone teach God knowledge,  
> Since He judges those on high?

## Job 21:23

> One dies in his full strength,  
> Being wholly undisturbed and at ease;

## Job 21:24

> His sides are filled with fat,  
> And the marrow of his bones is fresh.

## Job 21:25

> While another dies with a bitter soul,  
> Never even tasting anything good.

## Job 21:26

> Together they lie down in the dust,  
> And maggots cover them.

---

## Job 21:27

> Behold, I know your thoughts,  
> And the plans by which you would wrong me.

## Job 21:28

> For you say, ‘Where is the house of the nobleman,  
> And where is the tent, the dwelling places of the wicked?’

## Job 21:29

> Have you not asked travellers,  
> And do you not examine their evidence?

## Job 21:30

> That the evil person is spared on the day of disaster,  
> They are led away from the day of fury.

## Job 21:31

> Who confronts him with his actions,  
> And who repays him for what he has done?

## Job 21:32

> When he is carried to the grave,  
> People keep watch over his tomb.

## Job 21:33

> The clods of the valley will gently cover him;  
> Moreover, all mankind follows after him,  
> While countless others go before him.

---

## Job 21:34

> So how dare you give me empty comfort?  
> For your answers remain full of falsehood.”
