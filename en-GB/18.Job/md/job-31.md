# Job Chapter 31

## Job 31:1

> “I have made an agreement with my eyes;  
> How then could I gaze upon a young woman?

## Job 31:2

> And what is the portion given by God from above,  
> Or the inheritance from the Almighty on high?

## Job 31:3

> Is it not disaster for the unjust,  
> And misfortune for those who work iniquity?

## Job 31:4

> Does He not observe my ways,  
> And count all my steps?

---

## Job 31:5

> If I have walked in falsehood,  
> And my foot has hastened after deceit,

## Job 31:6

> Let Him weigh me with honest scales,  
> And let God know my integrity.

## Job 31:7

> If my step has strayed from the path,  
> Or my heart followed my eyes,  
> Or any stain has clung to my hands,

## Job 31:8

> Let me sow and another consume,  
> And let my produce be uprooted.

---

## Job 31:9

> If my heart has been lured by a woman,  
> Or I have waited at my neighbour’s doorway,

## Job 31:10

> May my wife grind for another,  
> And let others bow down over her.

## Job 31:11

> For that would be a shameful act;  
> Moreover, it would be wrongdoing punishable by judges.

## Job 31:12

> For it would be a fire that consumes to destruction,  
> And would uproot all my increase.

---

## Job 31:13

> If I have disregarded the plea of my male or female servants  
> When they brought a complaint against me,

## Job 31:14

> What then could I do when God rises up?  
> And when He calls me to account, how shall I answer Him?

## Job 31:15

> Did He who made me in the womb not make them,  
> And did not the same one form us in the womb?

---

## Job 31:16

> If I have denied the poor their desires,  
> Or caused the widow to lose hope,

## Job 31:17

> Or have eaten my morsel alone,  
> And not shared it with the orphan

## Job 31:18

> (But from my youth he grew up with me as with a father,  
> And from my mother’s womb I guided her),

## Job 31:19

> If I have seen anyone perish for lack of clothing,  
> Or a needy person without a cloak,

## Job 31:20

> If his waist has not blessed me,  
> Or he has not been warmed with the fleece of my sheep,

## Job 31:21

> If I have raised my hand against the orphan,  
> Because I saw I had support at the gate,

## Job 31:22

> May my shoulder dislocate,  
> And my arm be broken off at the elbow.

## Job 31:23

> For the fear of calamity from God is overwhelming to me,  
> And because of His majesty, I am powerless.

---

## Job 31:24

> If I have placed my trust in gold,  
> And called fine gold my security,

## Job 31:25

> If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great,  
> And because my hand had gained so much,

## Job 31:26

> If I have been captivated by the sun when it shone  
> Or the moon in its splendour,

## Job 31:27

> And my heart was secretly drawn,  
> And my hand offered a kiss from my mouth,

## Job 31:28

> That too would have been a sin deserving judgment,  
> For I would have denied God above.

---

## Job 31:29

> Have I rejoiced at the downfall of my enemy,  
> Or become glad when trouble found him?

## Job 31:30

> No, I have not permitted my mouth to sin  
> By asking for his life in a curse.

## Job 31:31

> Have the people of my tent not said,  
> ‘Who can find one who has not been satisfied with his food’?

## Job 31:32

> The stranger has not spent the night outside,  
> For I have opened my doors to the traveller.

## Job 31:33

> Have I concealed my transgressions like Adam,  
> By hiding my guilt in my heart,

## Job 31:34

> Because I was afraid of the large crowd,  
> And the scorn of families unnerved me,  
> And I kept silent and did not go out of doors?

---

## Job 31:35

> Oh that I had someone to hear me!  
> Here is my mark;  
> Let the Almighty respond to me!  
> And the indictment which my adversary has written,

## Job 31:36

> I would certainly carry it on my shoulder,  
> I would bind it to myself like a crown.

## Job 31:37

> I would recount to Him all my steps;  
> Like a prince, I would approach Him.

---

## Job 31:38

> If my land cries out against me,  
> And its furrows join in lament,

## Job 31:39

> If I have consumed its produce without payment,  
> Or have caused its owners to lose their lives,

## Job 31:40

> May thorns grow instead of wheat,  
> And weeds instead of barley.”  
> The words of Job are ended.
