# Job Chapter 31

## Job 31:1

> “I have made a covenant with my eyes;  
> How then could I look at a virgin?

## Job 31:2

> And what is the portion of God from above,  
> Or the inheritance of the Almighty from on high?

## Job 31:3

> Is it not disaster to the unjust,  
> And misfortune to those who work injustice?

## Job 31:4

> Does He not see my ways,  
> And count all my steps?

---

## Job 31:5

> If I have walked with deception,  
> And my foot has hurried after deceit,

## Job 31:6

> Let Him weigh me with accurate scales,  
> And let God know my integrity.

## Job 31:7

> If my step has turned from the way,  
> Or my heart followed my eyes,  
> Or any spot has stuck to my hands,

## Job 31:8

> Let me sow and another eat,  
> And let my crops be uprooted.

---

## Job 31:9

> If my heart has been enticed by a woman,  
> Or I have lurked at my neighbour’s doorway,

## Job 31:10

> May my wife grind for another,  
> And let others kneel down over her.

## Job 31:11

> For that would be a lustful crime;  
> Moreover, it would be wrongdoing punishable by judges.

## Job 31:12

> For it would be fire that consumes to Abaddon,  
> And would uproot all my increase.

---

## Job 31:13

> If I have rejected the claim of my male or female slaves  
> When they filed a complaint against me,

## Job 31:14

> What then could I do when God arises?  
> And when He calls me to account, how shall I answer Him?

## Job 31:15

> Did He who made me in the womb not make him,  
> And the same one create us in the womb?

---

## Job 31:16

> If I have kept the poor from their desire,  
> Or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail,

## Job 31:17

> Or have eaten my morsel alone,  
> And the orphan has not shared it

## Job 31:18

> (But from my youth he grew up with me as with a father,  
> And from my mother’s womb I guided her),

## Job 31:19

> If I have seen anyone perish for lack of clothing,  
> Or a needy person without a cloak,

## Job 31:20

> If his waist has not thanked me,  
> Or he has not been warmed with the fleece of my sheep,

## Job 31:21

> If I have lifted up my hand against the orphan,  
> Because I saw I had support at the gate,

## Job 31:22

> May my shoulder fall from its socket,  
> And my arm be broken off at the elbow.

## Job 31:23

> For disaster from God is a dread to me,  
> And because of His majesty I can do nothing.

---

## Job 31:24

> If I have put my confidence in gold,  
> And called fine gold my trust,

## Job 31:25

> If I have gloated because my wealth was great,  
> And because my hand had obtained so much,

## Job 31:26

> If I have looked at the sun when it shone  
> Or the moon going in splendour,

## Job 31:27

> And my heart was secretly enticed,  
> And my hand threw a kiss from my mouth,

## Job 31:28

> That too would have been a guilt calling for judgment,  
> For I would have denied God above.

---

## Job 31:29

> Have I rejoiced at the misfortune of my enemy,  
> Or become joyful when evil found him?

## Job 31:30

> No, I have not allowed my mouth to sin  
> By asking for his life in a curse.

## Job 31:31

> Have the people of my tent not said,  
> ‘Who can find one who has not been satisfied with his meat’?

## Job 31:32

> The stranger has not spent the night outside,  
> For I have opened my doors to the traveller.

## Job 31:33

> Have I covered my wrongdoings like Adam,  
> By hiding my guilt in my bosom,

## Job 31:34

> Because I feared the great multitude,  
> And the contempt of families terrified me,  
> And I kept silent and did not go out of doors?

---

## Job 31:35

> Oh that I had one to hear me!  
> Here is my signature;  
> Let the Almighty answer me!  
> And the indictment which my adversary has written,

## Job 31:36

> I would certainly carry it on my shoulder,  
> I would tie it to myself like a crown.

## Job 31:37

> I would declare to Him the number of my steps;  
> Like a prince, I would approach Him.

---

## Job 31:38

> If my land cries out against me,  
> And its furrows weep together,

## Job 31:39

> If I have eaten its fruit without money,  
> Or have caused its owners to lose their lives,

## Job 31:40

> May the thorn-bush grow instead of wheat,  
> And stinkweed instead of barley.”  
> The words of Job are ended.
