# Job Chapter 4

## Job 4:1

Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered:

## Job 4:2

> “If one dares to speak with you, will you become restless?
> Yet who can hold back words?

## Job 4:3

> Consider how you have taught many,
> and how you have strengthened weak hands.

## Job 4:4

> Your words have supported those who were stumbling,
> and you have strengthened faltering knees.

## Job 4:5

> But now it comes upon you, and you are disheartened;
> it touches you, and you are alarmed.

## Job 4:6

> Is not your reverence for God your confidence,
> and the integrity of your ways your hope?

---

## Job 4:7

> “Reflect now, who ever perished being innocent?
> Or where have the upright been destroyed?

## Job 4:8

> As I have observed,
> those who plough iniquity
> and those who sow trouble reap the same.

## Job 4:9

> By the breath of God they perish;
> by the blast of His anger they are consumed.

## Job 4:10

> The roaring of the lion and the voice of the fierce lion,
> yet the teeth of the young lions are shattered.

## Job 4:11

> The lion perishes for lack of prey,
> and the cubs of the lioness are dispersed.

## Job 4:12

> “A word was secretly brought to me,
> and my ear caught a whisper of it.

## Job 4:13

> Amid troubling thoughts from visions of the night,
> when deep sleep falls on people,

## Job 4:14

> fear and trembling came upon me,
> and made all my bones shake.

## Job 4:15

> A spirit glided past my face;
> the hair of my flesh stood on end.

## Job 4:16

> It stood still, but I could not discern its form;
> a shape was before my eyes,
> and I heard a quiet voice:

## Job 4:17

> ‘Can a mortal be just before God?
> Can a man be pure before his Maker?

## Job 4:18

> He puts no trust even in His servants,
> and He charges His angels with error.

## Job 4:19

> How much more those who dwell in houses of clay,
> whose foundation is in the dust,
> who are crushed more easily than a moth!

## Job 4:20

> From morning to evening they are shattered;
> unnoticed, they perish forever.

## Job 4:21

> Are not the cords of their tent pulled up within them?
> They die without wisdom.’
