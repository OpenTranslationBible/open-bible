# Job Chapter 4

## Job 4:1

Then Eliphaz the Temanite responded,

## Job 4:2

> “If one ventures a word with you, will you become impatient?  
> But who can refrain from speaking?

## Job 4:3

> Behold, you have instructed many,  
> And you have strengthened weak hands.

## Job 4:4

> Your words have helped the stumbling to stand,  
> And you have strengthened feeble knees.

## Job 4:5

> But now it comes to you, and you are impatient;  
> It touches you, and you are horrified.

## Job 4:6

> Is your fear of God not your confidence,  
> And the integrity of your ways your hope?

## Job 4:7

> “Remember now, who ever perished being innocent?  
> Or where were the upright destroyed?

## Job 4:8

> According to what I have seen,  
> Those who plough wrongdoing  
> And those who sow trouble harvest it.

## Job 4:9

> By the breath of God they perish,  
> And by the blast of His anger they come to an end.

## Job 4:10

> The roaring of the lion and the voice of the fierce lion,  
> And the teeth of the young lions are broken.

## Job 4:11

> The lion perishes for lack of prey,  
> And the cubs of the lioness are scattered.

## Job 4:12

> “Now a word was brought to me secretly,  
> And my ear received a whisper of it.

## Job 4:13

> Amid disquieting thoughts from visions of the night,  
> When deep sleep falls on people,

## Job 4:14

> Dread came upon me, and trembling,  
> And made all my bones shake.

## Job 4:15

> Then a spirit passed by my face;  
> The hair of my flesh bristled.

## Job 4:16

> It stood still, but I could not recognise its appearance;  
> A form was before my eyes;  
> There was silence, then I heard a voice:

## Job 4:17

> ‘Can mankind be righteous before God?  
> Can a man be pure before his Maker?’

## Job 4:18

> He puts no trust even in His servants,  
> And He accuses His angels of error.

## Job 4:19

> How much more those who dwell in houses of clay,  
> Whose foundation is in the dust,  
> Who are crushed before the moth!

## Job 4:20

> Between morning and evening they are broken in pieces;  
> Unnoticed, they perish forever.

## Job 4:21

> Is their tent-cord not pulled out within them?  
> They die, yet without wisdom.”
