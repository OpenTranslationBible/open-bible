# Job Chapter 5

## Job 5:1

> “Call now, is there anyone who will answer you?  
> And to which of the holy ones will you turn?

## Job 5:2

> And jealousy brings death to the naive.

## Job 5:3

> I have seen the fool taking root,  
> And I cursed his home immediately.

## Job 5:4

> His sons are far from safety,  
> They are even oppressed in the gate,  
> And there is no rescuer.

## Job 5:5

> The hungry devour his harvest  
> And take it even from the thorns,  
> And the schemer pants after their wealth.

## Job 5:6

> For disaster does not come from the dust,  
> Nor does trouble sprout from the ground,

## Job 5:7

> But man is born for trouble,  
> As sparks fly upward.

## Job 5:8

> “However, I would seek God,  
> And I would make my plea to God,

## Job 5:9

> Who does great and unsearchable things,  
> Wonders without number.

## Job 5:10

> He gives rain on the earth,  
> And sends water on the fields,

## Job 5:11

> So that He sets the lowly on high,  
> And those who mourn are lifted to safety.

## Job 5:12

> He frustrates the schemes of the shrewd,  
> So that their hands cannot attain success.

## Job 5:13

> He captures the wise by their own cleverness,  
> And the advice of the cunning is quickly thwarted.

## Job 5:14

> By day they encounter darkness,  
> And grope at noon as in the night.

## Job 5:15

> But He saves from the sword of their mouth,  
> And the poor from the hand of the strong.

## Job 5:16

> So the helpless has hope,  
> And injustice shuts its mouth.

## Job 5:17

> “Behold, happy is the person whom God disciplines,

## Job 5:18

> For He inflicts pain, and gives relief;  
> He wounds, and His hands also heal.

## Job 5:19

> From six troubles He will save you,  
> Even in seven, evil will not touch you.

## Job 5:20

> In famine He will redeem you from death,  
> And in war, from the power of the sword.

## Job 5:21

> You will be hidden from the scourge of the tongue,  
> And will not be afraid of violence when it comes.

## Job 5:22

> You will laugh at violence and hunger,  
> And you will not be afraid of wild animals.

## Job 5:23

> For you will be in league with the stones of the field,  
> And the animals of the field will be at peace with you.

## Job 5:24

> You will know that your tent is secure,  
> For you will visit your home and not find anything missing.

## Job 5:25

> You will also know that your descendants will be many,  
> And your offspring as the grass of the earth.

## Job 5:26

> You will come to the grave at a ripe age,  
> Like the stacking of grain in its season.

## Job 5:27

> Behold, we have examined this, and so it is;  
> Hear it, and know for yourself.”
