# Job Chapter 3

## Job 3:1

Following these events, Job spoke and lamented the day of his birth.

## Job 3:2

And he said:

---

## Job 3:3

> “May the day of my birth vanish,
> and the night that declared, ‘A boy is conceived.’

## Job 3:4

> Let that day be darkness;
> may God above disregard it,
> and let no light shine upon it.

## Job 3:5

> Let darkness and deep shadow claim it;
> let a cloud dwell upon it;
> let the blackness of the day terrify it.

## Job 3:6

> As for that night, let thick darkness seize it;
> let it not be counted among the days of the year,
> nor be numbered among the months.

## Job 3:7

> Behold, let that night be barren;
> let no joyful shout be heard in it.

## Job 3:8

> Let those who curse days curse that day,
> those who are ready to rouse Leviathan.

## Job 3:9

> Let its morning stars be darkened;
> let it hope for light but have none,
> and let it not see the first light of dawn,

## Job 3:10

> because it did not shut the doors of my mother’s womb,
> nor hide trouble from my eyes.

---

## Job 3:11

> “Why did I not perish at birth,
> come forth from the womb and expire?

## Job 3:12

> Why were there knees to receive me,
> and breasts that I might suckle?

## Job 3:13

> For now, I would be lying down in peace;
> I would be asleep and at rest,

## Job 3:14

> with kings and counsellors of the earth,
> who built ruins for themselves,

## Job 3:15

> or with princes who had gold,
> who filled their houses with silver.

## Job 3:16

> Or why was I not hidden like a stillborn child,
> like infants who never saw the light?

## Job 3:17

> There the wicked cease from turmoil,
> and there the weary are at rest.

## Job 3:18

> The prisoners are at ease together;
> they do not hear the voice of the taskmaster.

## Job 3:19

> The small and the great are there,
> and the slave is free from his master.

## Job 3:20

> “Why is light given to those in misery,
> and life to the bitter in soul,

## Job 3:21

> to those who long for death, but it does not come,
> and dig for it more than for hidden treasures,

## Job 3:22

> who are filled with joy
> and exult when they find the grave?

## Job 3:23

> Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden,
> whom God has hedged in?

## Job 3:24

> For my sighing comes before my food,
> and my groans pour out like water.

## Job 3:25

> For what I feared has come upon me,
> and what I dreaded has overtaken me.

## Job 3:26

> I have no peace, no quiet,
> no rest, but only turmoil.”
