# Job Chapter 11

## Job 11:1

Then Zophar the Naamathite responded,

## Job 11:2

> “Shall a multitude of words go unanswered,  
> And a talkative man be acquitted?

## Job 11:3

> Shall your boasts silence people?  
> And shall you scoff and no one rebuke?

## Job 11:4

> For you have said, ‘My teaching is pure,  
> And I am innocent in Your eyes.’

## Job 11:5

> But if only God would speak,  
> And open His lips against you,

## Job 11:6

> And show you the secrets of wisdom!  
> For sound wisdom has two sides.  
> Know then that God forgets part of your guilt.

## Job 11:7

> “Can you discover the depths of God?  
> Can you discover the limits of the Almighty?

## Job 11:8

> They are as high as the heavens—what can you do?  
> Deeper than Sheol—what can you know?

## Job 11:9

> Its measure is longer than the earth  
> And broader than the sea.

## Job 11:10

> If He passes by or apprehends people,  
> Or gathers them together, who can turn Him back?

## Job 11:11

> For He knows false people,  
> And sees injustice without investigating.

## Job 11:12

> An idiot will become intelligent  
> When a wild donkey is born a human.

## Job 11:13

> “If you would direct your heart rightly  
> And spread out your hands to Him,

## Job 11:14

> If wrongdoing is in your hand, put it far away,  
> And do not let malice dwell in your tents;

## Job 11:15

> Then, indeed, you could lift up your face without moral blemish,  
> And you would be firmly established and not fear.

## Job 11:16

> For you would forget your trouble;  
> Like waters that have passed by, you would remember it.

## Job 11:17

> Your life would be brighter than noonday;  
> Darkness would be like the morning.

## Job 11:18

> Then you would trust, because there is hope;  
> And you would look around and rest securely.

## Job 11:19

> You would lie down and none would disturb you,  
> And many would flatter you.

## Job 11:20

> But the eyes of the wicked will fail,  
> And there will be no escape for them;  
> And their hope is to breathe their last.”
