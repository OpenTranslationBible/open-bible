# Job Chapter 11

## Job 11:1

Then Zophar the Naamathite answered:

## Job 11:2

> “Should a torrent of words remain unanswered,
> and should a man full of talk be justified?

## Job 11:3

> Should your empty chatter silence others?
> Will no one correct you when you mock?

## Job 11:4

> You claim, ‘My doctrine is pure,
> and I am clean in your sight.’

## Job 11:5

> Oh, that God would speak
> and open His lips against you,

## Job 11:6

> and reveal to you the secrets of wisdom,
> for true wisdom has two sides.
> Be assured that God has overlooked some of your iniquity.

---

## Job 11:7

> “Can you comprehend the mysteries of God?
> Can you explore the limits of the Almighty?

## Job 11:8

> They are higher than the heavens—what can you achieve?
> They are deeper than the grave—what can you understand?

## Job 11:9

> Their scope is longer than the earth
> and broader than the sea.

---

## Job 11:10

> If He passes by and imprisons or calls a court,
> who can oppose Him?

## Job 11:11

> For He knows deceitful men;
> He sees wickedness without needing to examine it.

## Job 11:12

> A senseless person will gain understanding
> when a wild donkey’s colt is born a man.

---

## Job 11:13

> “If you prepare your heart and
> stretch out your hands towards Him,

## Job 11:14

> if there is any wrong in your hand, remove it,
> and do not let wickedness reside in your tents,

## Job 11:15

> then you will lift up your face without shame;
> you will stand firm and without fear.

## Job 11:16

> You will forget your misery,
> remembering it like waters that have passed away.

## Job 11:17

> Your life will be brighter than the noonday;
> even darkness will be like the morning.

## Job 11:18

> You will feel secure, for there is hope;
> you will look around and rest in safety.

## Job 11:19

> You will lie down, and none will make you afraid,
> and many will seek your favour.

## Job 11:20

> But the eyes of the wicked will fail,
> and escape will elude them;
> their hope will be to breathe their last.”
