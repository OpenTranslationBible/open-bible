# Job Chapter 42

## Job 42:1

Then Job answered the Lord and said,

## Job 42:2

> “I know that You can do all things,  
> And that no plan is impossible for You.

## Job 42:3

> ‘Who is this who conceals advice without knowledge?’  
> Therefore I have declared that which I did not understand,  
> Things too wonderful for me, which I do not know.

## Job 42:4

> ‘Please listen, and I will speak;  
> I will ask You, and You instruct me.’

## Job 42:5

> I have heard of You by the hearing of the ear;  
> But now my eye sees You;

## Job 42:6

> Therefore I retract,  
> And I repent, sitting on dust and ashes.”

## Job 42:7

Now it came about, after the Lord had spoken these words to Job,  
that the Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite,  
“My wrath is kindled against you and against your two friends,  
because you have not spoken of Me what is trustworthy, as My servant Job has.

## Job 42:8

Now therefore, take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams,  
and go to My servant Job, and offer up a burnt offering for yourselves,  
and My servant Job will pray for you.  
For I will accept him, so that I may not do with you as your foolishness deserves,  
because you have not spoken of Me what is trustworthy, as My servant Job has.”

## Job 42:9

So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite went and did as the Lord told them;  
and the Lord accepted Job.

## Job 42:10

The Lord also restored the fortunes of Job when he prayed for his friends,  
and the Lord increased double all that Job had.

## Job 42:11

Then all his brothers, all his sisters,  
and all who had known him before came to him,  
and they ate bread with him in his house;  
and they sympathised with him and comforted him for all the adversities  
that the Lord had brought on him.  
And each one gave him a piece of money, and each a ring of gold.

## Job 42:12

And the Lord blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning.  
And he had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels,  
a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand female donkeys.

## Job 42:13

He also had seven sons and three daughters.

## Job 42:14

And he named the first Jemimah, the second Keziah, and the third Keren-happuch.

## Job 42:15

In all the land no women were found as beautiful as Job’s daughters;  
and their father gave them inheritances among their brothers.

After this, Job lived 140 years,  
and saw his sons and his grandsons, four generations.

## Job 42:17

And Job died, an old man and full of days.
