# Job Chapter 42

## Job 42:1

Then Job responded to the Lord and said,

## Job 42:2

> “I know that you can do all things,
> and that no purpose of yours can be hindered.

## Job 42:3

> ‘Who is this that obscures counsel without knowledge?’
> Indeed, I spoke of things I did not understand,
> things too marvellous for me to know.

## Job 42:4

> ‘Listen now, and I will speak;
> I will question you, and you will inform me.’

## Job 42:5

> My ears had heard of you,
> but now my eyes have seen you;

## Job 42:6

> Therefore I retract my words
> and repent in dust and ashes.”

## Job 42:7

After the Lord had spoken these words to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Temanite, “My anger burns against you and your two friends, because you have not spoken what is right about me, as my servant Job has.

## Job 42:8

Now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and offer a burnt offering for yourselves. My servant Job will pray for you, and I will accept his prayer and not deal with you according to your folly, because you have not spoken what is right about me, as my servant Job has.”

## Job 42:9

So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite went and did as the Lord had instructed them; and the Lord accepted Job’s prayer.

## Job 42:11

Then all his brothers, sisters, and everyone who had known him before came to him and ate with him in his house. They sympathised with him and comforted him over all the misfortunes the Lord had brought upon him, and each one gave him a piece of silver and a gold ring.
