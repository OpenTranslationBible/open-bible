## Job 9:14

> How then can I answer Him,
> or choose my words with Him?

## Job 9:15

> Even if I were innocent, I could not answer Him;
> I would have to plead for mercy from my Judge.

## Job 9:16

> If I called and He answered me,
> I would not believe that He was listening to my voice.

## Job 9:17

> He would crush me with a storm
> and multiply my wounds without cause.

## Job 9:18

> He would not allow me to catch my breath,
> but would fill me with bitterness.

## Job 9:19

> If it is a matter of strength, He is mighty;
> and if it is a matter of justice, who can summon Him?

## Job 9:20

> Even if I were righteous, my own mouth would condemn me;
> if I were guiltless, it would declare me guilty.

## Job 9:21

> I am blameless, yet I do not care for myself;
> I despise my life.

## Job 9:22

> It is all the same; therefore I say,
> ‘He destroys both the guiltless and the wicked.’

## Job 9:23

> If a scourge brings sudden death,
> He mocks the despair of the innocent.

## Job 9:24

> When a land is given into the hands of the wicked,
> He blinds its judges.
> If it is not He, then who is it?

## Job 9:25

> “My days are swifter than a runner;
> they flee away, they see no good.

## Job 9:26

> They pass by like papyrus boats,
> like an eagle swooping down on its prey.

## Job 9:27

> If I say, ‘I will forget my complaint,
> I will change my expression, and smile,’

## Job 9:28

> I still dread all my sufferings,
> for I know that You will not acquit me.

## Job 9:29

> Since I am already guilty,
> why should I labour in vain?

## Job 9:30

> Even if I washed myself with snow
> and cleansed my hands with lye,

## Job 9:31

> You would plunge me into a pit,
> so that even my clothes would detest me.

---

## Job 9:32

> For He is not a man, as I am, that I might answer Him,
> that we might confront each other in court.

## Job 9:33

> There is no mediator between us,
> who might lay his hand upon us both.

## Job 9:34

> Let Him remove His rod from me,
> and let not His dread terrify me.

## Job 9:35

> Then I would speak without fear of Him,
> but as it stands with me, I cannot.
