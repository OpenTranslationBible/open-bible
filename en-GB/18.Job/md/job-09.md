# Job Chapter 9

## Job 9:1

Then Job responded,

## Job 9:2

> “Truly I know that this is so;  
> But how can a person be in the right before God?

## Job 9:3

> If one wished to dispute with Him,  
> He could not answer Him once in a thousand times.

## Job 9:4

> Wise in heart and mighty in strength,  
> Who has defied Him and remained unscathed?

## Job 9:5

> It is He who removes mountains, and they do not know how,  
> When He overturns them in His anger.

## Job 9:6

> He shakes the earth from its place,  
> And its pillars tremble.

## Job 9:7

> He commands the sun not to shine,  
> And sets a seal on the stars.

## Job 9:8

> He alone stretches out the heavens,  
> And tramples down the waves of the sea;

## Job 9:9

> He made the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades,  
> And the constellations of the south.

## Job 9:10

> He does great and unsearchable things,  
> Wonders without number.

## Job 9:11

> If He were to pass by me, I would not see Him;  
> Were He to move past me, I would not perceive Him.

## Job 9:12

> If He were to snatch away, who could restrain Him?  
> Who could say to Him, ‘What are You doing?’

## Job 9:13

> God will not turn back His anger;  
> Beneath Him the helpers of Rahab cower.

## Job 9:14

> How then can I answer Him,  
> And choose my words before Him?

## Job 9:15

> For though I were right, I could not answer;  
> I would have to implore the mercy of my Judge.

## Job 9:16

> If I called and He answered me,  
> I could not believe that He was listening to my voice.

## Job 9:17

> For He bruises me with a storm  
> And multiplies my wounds without cause.

## Job 9:18

> He will not allow me to get my breath,  
> But He saturates me with bitterness.

## Job 9:19

> If it is a matter of power, behold, He is the strong one!  
> And if it is justice, who can summon Him?

## Job 9:20

> Though I am righteous, my mouth will condemn me;  
> Though I am blameless, He will declare me guilty.

---

## Job 9:21

> I am blameless; I do not take notice of myself;  
> I reject my life.

## Job 9:22

> It is all one; therefore I say,  
> ‘He destroys the blameless and the wicked.’

## Job 9:23

> If the whip kills suddenly,  
> He mocks the despair of the innocent.

## Job 9:24

> The earth is handed over to the wicked;  
> He covers the faces of its judges.  
> If it is not He, then who is it?

---

## Job 9:25

> Now my days are swifter than a runner;  
> They flee away, they see no good.

## Job 9:26

> They slip by like reed boats,  
> Like an eagle that swoops on its prey.

## Job 9:27

> Though I say, ‘I will forget my complaint,  
> I will put my face in order and be cheerful,’

## Job 9:28

> I become afraid of all my pain,  
> I know that You will not acquit me.

## Job 9:29

> I am guilty,  
> Why then should I labour in vain?

## Job 9:30

> If I washed myself with snow,  
> And cleansed my hands with lye,

## Job 9:31

> Yet You would plunge me into the pit,  
> And my own clothes would loathe me.

---

## Job 9:32

> For He is not a man, as I am, that I may answer Him—  
> That we may go to court together.

## Job 9:33

> There is no arbitrator between us,  
> Who could place his hand upon us both.

## Job 9:34

> Let Him remove His rod from me,  
> And let not the dread of Him terrify me.

## Job 9:35

> Then I would speak and not fear Him;  
> But I am not like that in myself.
