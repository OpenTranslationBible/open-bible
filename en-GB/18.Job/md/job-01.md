# Job Chapter 1

## Job 1:1

In the land of Uz, there was a man named Job; this man was blameless and upright, fearing God and avoiding evil.

## Job 1:2

He had seven sons and three daughters.

## Job 1:3

His possessions included seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred donkeys, and a great many servants. He was the most prominent man among all the people of the East.

## Job 1:4

His sons would take turns holding feasts in their homes on their appointed day, and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.

## Job 1:5

When the days of feasting had run their course, Job would send for them and consecrate them. Rising early in the morning, he would offer a burnt offering for each of them, thinking, “Perhaps my children have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” This was Job’s regular practice.

## Job 1:6

One day, the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came among them.

## Job 1:7

The Lord asked Satan, “Where have you come from?”

---

Satan answered the Lord, “From roaming through the earth and walking back and forth on it.”

## Job 1:8

Then the Lord said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one like him on earth; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil.”

---

## Job 1:9

Satan replied to the Lord, “Does Job fear God for nothing?”

## Job 1:10

“Have you not placed a hedge around him and his household and all that he owns? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his livestock have spread throughout the land.

## Job 1:11

But stretch out your hand now and touch all that he has, and he will surely curse you to your face.”

---

## Job 1:12

The Lord said to Satan, “Very well, all that he has is in your power, but do not lay a hand on the man himself.”

So Satan departed from the presence of the Lord.

## Job 1:13

One day, while Job’s sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house,

## Job 1:14

a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were ploughing and the donkeys were grazing nearby,

## Job 1:15

when the Sabeans attacked and took them away. They put the servants to the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”

---

## Job 1:16

While he was still speaking, another messenger arrived and said, “The fire of God fell from the sky and burned up the sheep and the servants, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”

## Job 1:17

While he was still speaking, another messenger came and said, “The Chaldeans formed three bands and raided the camels and took them away. They put the servants to the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”

## Job 1:18

While he was still speaking, yet another messenger came and said, “Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine at their eldest brother’s house,

## Job 1:19

when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house, and it collapsed on them, and they are dead. I alone have escaped to tell you.”

## Job 1:20

At this, Job arose, tore his robe, and shaved his head. Then he fell to the ground and worshipped.

## Job 1:21

He said,

> “Naked I came from my mother’s womb,
> and naked I shall return there.
> The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away;
> blessed be the name of the Lord.”

## Job 1:22

In all this, Job did not sin or blame God.
