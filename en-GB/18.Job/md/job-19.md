## Job 19:20

> My bone clings to my skin and my flesh,

## Job 19:21

> “Pity me, pity me, you friends of mine,  
> For the hand of God has struck me.

## Job 19:22

## Job 19:23

> “Oh that my words were written!  
> Oh that they were recorded in a book!

## Job 19:24

> They were engraved in the rock forever!

> Yet as for me, I know that my Redeemer lives,  
> And at the last, He will take His stand on the earth.

> Even after my skin is destroyed,  
> Yet from my flesh I will see God,

## Job 19:27

> Whom I, on my part, shall behold for myself,  
> And whom my eyes will see, and not another.  
> My heart faints within me!

---

## Job 19:28

> “If you say, ‘How shall we persecute him?’  
> And, ‘What pretext for a case against him can we find?’

## Job 19:29

> Then be afraid of the sword for yourselves,  
> For wrath brings the punishment of the sword,  
> So that you may know there is judgment.”
