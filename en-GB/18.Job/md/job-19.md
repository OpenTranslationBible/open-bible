## Job 19:1

Then Job answered,

## Job 19:2

> “How long will you torment me
> and crush me with your words?

## Job 19:3

> You have reproached me these ten times;
> you are not ashamed to mistreat me.

## Job 19:4

> Even if I have erred,
> my mistake concerns me alone.

## Job 19:5

> If indeed you exalt yourselves over me
> and use my disgrace against me,

## Job 19:6

> then know that God has wronged me
> and encircled me with His net.

---

## Job 19:7

> “Though I cry out, ‘Violence!’ I receive no answer;
> I call for help, but there is no justice.

## Job 19:8

> He has blocked my path so I cannot pass,
> and He has shrouded my ways in darkness.

## Job 19:9

> He has stripped me of my honour
> and taken the crown from my head.

## Job 19:10

> He tears me down on all sides,
> and I am gone; He uproots my hope like a tree.

## Job 19:11

> His anger burns against me;
> He regards me as His enemy.

## Job 19:12

> His troops advance together;
> they construct a siege ramp against me
> and encamp around my tent.

---

## Job 19:13

> “He has alienated my brothers from me,
> and my acquaintances are estranged from me.

## Job 19:14

> My relatives have failed me;
> my close friends have forgotten me.

## Job 19:15

> The dwellers in my house and my maidservants consider me a stranger;
> I am a foreigner in their sight.

## Job 19:16

> I call to my servant, but he gives no answer;
> I must plead with him with my own mouth.

## Job 19:17

> My breath is offensive to my wife,
> and I am loathsome to my own family.

## Job 19:18

> Even young children despise me;
> when I stand up, they speak against me.

## Job 19:19

> All my close friends abhor me;
> those I love have turned against me.

## Job 19:20

> I am reduced to skin and bones;
> I have escaped with only the skin of my teeth.

## Job 19:21

> “Have pity on me, my friends, have pity,
> for the hand of God has struck me.

## Job 19:22

> Why do you pursue me as God does?
> Are you not satisfied with my flesh?

---

## Job 19:23

> “Oh, that my words were recorded,
> that they were inscribed in a book,

## Job 19:24

> that they were engraved with an iron tool and lead,
> or carved in the rock forever!

## Job 19:25

> For I know that my Redeemer lives,
> and that in the end He will stand upon the earth.

## Job 19:26

> And after my skin has been destroyed,
> yet in my flesh I shall see God;

## Job 19:27

> I myself will see Him with my own eyes
> — I, and not another.
> My heart yearns within me!

## Job 19:28

> If you say, ‘How shall we persecute him,
> since the root of the trouble is found in him,’

## Job 19:29

> then be afraid of the sword for yourselves,
> for wrath brings the punishment of the sword,
> so that you may know there is judgment.”
