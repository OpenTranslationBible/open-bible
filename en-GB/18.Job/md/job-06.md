# Job Chapter 6

## Job 6:1

Then Job responded,

## Job 6:2

> “Oh that my grief were actually weighed  
> And laid in the balances together with my disaster!

## Job 6:3

> For then it would be heavier than the sand of the seas;  
> Therefore my words have been rash.

## Job 6:4

> For the arrows of the Almighty are within me,  
> Their poison my spirit drinks;  
> The terrors of God line up against me.

## Job 6:5

> Does the wild donkey bray over fresh grass,  
> Or does the ox low over its fodder?

## Job 6:6

> Can something tasteless be eaten without salt,  
> Or is there flavour in the juice of mallow?

## Job 6:7

> My soul refuses to touch them;  
> They are like loathsome food to me.

---

## Job 6:8

> Oh that my request might come to pass,  
> And that God would grant me what I long for!

## Job 6:9

> Would that God were willing to crush me,  
> That He would release His hand and cut me off!

## Job 6:10

> But it is still my comfort,  
> And I rejoice in unsparing pain,  
> That I have not denied the words of the Holy One.

---

## Job 6:11

> What is my strength, that I should wait?  
> And what is my end, that I should endure?

## Job 6:12

> Is my strength the strength of stones,  
> Or is my flesh bronze?

## Job 6:13

> Is it that there is no help within me,  
> And that a success is driven from me?

---

## Job 6:14

> For the despairing one there should be kindness from his friend,  
> So that he does not abandon the fear of the Almighty.

## Job 6:15

> My brothers have acted deceitfully like a wadi,  
> Like the torrents of wadis that drain away,

## Job 6:16

> Which are dark because of ice,  
> And into which the snow melts.

## Job 6:17

> When they dry up, they vanish;  
> When it is hot, they disappear from their place.

## Job 6:18

> The paths of their course wind along,  
> They go up into nothing and perish.

## Job 6:19

> The caravans of Tema looked,  
> The travellers of Sheba hoped for them.

## Job 6:20

> They were put to shame, for they had trusted,  
> They came there and were humiliated.

## Job 6:21

> Indeed, you have now become such;  
> You see terrors and are afraid.

## Job 6:22

> Have I said, ‘Give me something,’  
> Or, ‘Offer a bribe for me from your wealth,’

## Job 6:23

> Or, ‘Save me from the hand of the enemy,’  
> Or, ‘Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors’?

---

## Job 6:24

> Teach me, and I will be silent;  
> And show me how I have erred.

## Job 6:25

> How painful are honest words!  
> But what does your argument prove?

## Job 6:26

> Do you intend to rebuke my words,  
> The words of one in despair, which are as wind?

## Job 6:27

> You would even cast lots for the orphans,  
> And barter over your friend.

---

## Job 6:28

> Now please look at me,  
> And see if I lie to your face.

## Job 6:29

> Please turn away, let there be no injustice;  
> Turn away, my righteousness is still intact.

## Job 6:30

> Is there injustice on my tongue?  
> Cannot my palate discern disaster?
