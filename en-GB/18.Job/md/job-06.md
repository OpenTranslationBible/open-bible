# Job Chapter 6

## Job 6:1

Then Job responded, saying

## Job 6:2

> “If only my anguish were weighed
> and my calamity laid in the balances together!

## Job 6:3

> For it would surely be heavier than the sand of the seas;
> that is why my words have been rash.

## Job 6:4

> The arrows of the Almighty are within me,
> my spirit drinks their poison;
> the terrors of God are arrayed against me.

## Job 6:5

> Does a wild donkey bray when it has grass,
> or does an ox low over its fodder?

## Job 6:6

> Can tasteless food be eaten without salt,
> or is there any flavour in the juice of the mallow?

## Job 6:7

> I refuse to touch such things;
> they are like loathsome food to me.

## Job 6:8

> “Oh, that my request might be fulfilled,
> that God would grant what I long for,

## Job 6:9

> that God would be willing to crush me,
> to let loose His hand and cut me off!

## Job 6:10

> Then I would still have this consolation—
> my joy in relentless pain—
> that I have not denied the words of the Holy One.

## Job 6:11

> What strength do I have, that I should hope?
> What is my end, that I should be patient?

## Job 6:12

> Is my strength the strength of stones,
> or is my flesh made of bronze?

## Job 6:13

> Is there any help within me,
> now that success has been driven away?

## Job 6:14

> “For a despairing man there should be kindness from his friend,
> so that he does not forsake the fear of the Almighty.

## Job 6:15

> But my brothers have acted deceitfully like a wadi,
> like the streams that overflow

## Job 6:16

> when they are darkened by thawing ice
> and filled with melting snow,

## Job 6:17

> but when they dry up, they vanish;
> in the heat they disappear from their place.

## Job 6:18

> Their paths meander;
> they ascend into wasteland and are lost.

## Job 6:19

> The caravans of Tema look,
> the travellers of Sheba hope for them.

## Job 6:20

> They are put to shame because they had trusted;
> they arrive there, only to be disappointed.

## Job 6:21

> Indeed, you have now become like them;
> you see something dreadful and are afraid.

## Job 6:22

> Have I ever said, ‘Give me something,’ or,
> ‘Offer a bribe on my behalf from your wealth,’

## Job 6:23

> or, ‘Deliver me from the hand of the enemy,’
> or, ‘Redeem me from the clutches of the ruthless’?

## Job 6:24

> “Teach me, and I will be silent;
> show me where I have gone wrong.

## Job 6:25

> How difficult it is to hear honest words!
> But what do your arguments establish?

## Job 6:26

> Do you intend to correct my words,
> and treat the words of one in despair as wind?

## Job 6:27

> You would even gamble over an orphan
> and bargain away your friend.

---

## Job 6:28

> But now, please look at me,
> and see if I am lying to your face.

## Job 6:29

> Relent, let there be no injustice;
> reconsider, for my integrity is at stake.

## Job 6:30

> Is there any wickedness on my tongue?
> Does my mouth not discern calamity?
