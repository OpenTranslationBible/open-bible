> my tongue is ready to speak.

## Job 33:3

> my lips express knowledge sincerely.

> the breath of the Almighty gives me life.

> prepare yourself and take your stand.

> “But you have spoken in my hearing,
> and I have heard the very words you said:

## Job 33:9

> ‘I am pure, without transgression;
> I am clean and there is no iniquity in me.

## Job 33:10

> Yet He finds occasions against me;
> He regards me as His adversary.

## Job 33:11

## Job 33:12

> “But I say to you, in this you are not right,
> for God is greater than any human.

> saying He does not answer any of your words?

## Job 33:14

> now another—yet no one notices it.

## Job 33:15

> In a dream, a vision of the night,
> when deep sleep falls upon people,
> while they slumber on their beds,

## Job 33:16

> He may open their ears
> and terrify them with warnings,

## Job 33:17

> to turn a person from wrongdoing
> and to keep them from pride,

## Job 33:18

> to preserve their soul from the pit,
> and their life from perishing by the sword.

## Job 33:19

> “Or they may be chastened on a bed of pain,
> with constant distress in their bones,

## Job 33:20

> so that their being loathes bread,
> and their soul despises their favourite food.

## Job 33:21

> Their flesh wastes away to nothing,
> and their bones, once unseen, now stick out.

## Job 33:22

> Their soul draws near to the pit,
> and their life to the messengers of death.

## Job 33:23

> Yet if there is an angel on their side, a mediator,
> one out of a thousand,
> to show them what is right,

## Job 33:24

> and he is gracious to them, and says,
> ‘Deliver them from going down to the pit;
> I have found a ransom for them—

## Job 33:25

> let their flesh be renewed like a child’s;
> let them return to the days of their youthful vigour’—

## Job 33:26

> then they will pray to God
> and find favour with Him; they will see His face with joy,
> and He will restore their righteousness.

## Job 33:27

> They will sing to others and say,
> ‘I have sinned and perverted what was right,
> but I did not receive what I deserved.

## Job 33:28

> He has redeemed my soul from going down to the pit,
> and my life shall see the light.’

---

## Job 33:29

> “Indeed, God does all these things for a person—twice, even three times—

## Job 33:30

> to bring back their soul from the pit,
> that they may be enlightened with the light of life.

---

## Job 33:31

> “Pay attention, Job, and listen to me;
> be silent, and I will speak.

## Job 33:32

> If you have anything to say, answer me;
> speak, for I desire to justify you.

## Job 33:33

> But if not, then listen to me;
> keep silent, and I will teach you wisdom.”
