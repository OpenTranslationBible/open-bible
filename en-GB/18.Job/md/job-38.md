# Job Chapter 38

## Job 38:1

Then the Lord answered Job from the whirlwind and said,

## Job 38:2

> “Who is this who darkens the divine plan  
> By words without knowledge?

## Job 38:3

> Now tighten the belt on your waist like a man,  
> And I shall ask you, and you inform Me!

---

## Job 38:4

> Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?  
> Tell Me, if you have understanding,

## Job 38:5

> Who set its measurements? Since you know.  
> Or who stretched the measuring line over it?

## Job 38:6

> On what were its bases sunk?  
> Or who laid its cornerstone,

## Job 38:7

> When the morning stars sang together  
> And all the sons of God shouted for joy?

---

## Job 38:8

> Or who enclosed the sea with doors  
> When it went out from the womb, bursting forth;

## Job 38:9

> When I made a cloud its garment,  
> And thick darkness its swaddling bands,

## Job 38:10

> And I placed boundaries on it  
> And set a bolt and doors,

## Job 38:11

> And I said, ‘As far as this point you shall come, but no farther;  
> And here your proud waves shall stop’?

---

## Job 38:12

> Have you ever in your life commanded the morning,  
> And made the dawn know its place,

## Job 38:13

> So that it would seize the ends of the earth,  
> And the wicked would be shaken off from it?

## Job 38:14

> It is changed like clay under the seal;  
> And they stand out like a garment.

## Job 38:15

> Their light is withheld from the wicked,  
> And the uplifted arm is broken.

---

## Job 38:16

> Have you entered the springs of the sea,  
> And walked in the depth of the ocean?

## Job 38:17

> Have the gates of death been revealed to you,  
> And have you seen the gates of deep darkness?

## Job 38:18

> Have you understood the expanse of the earth?  
> Tell Me, if you know all this.

---

## Job 38:19

> Where is the way to the dwelling of light?  
> And darkness, where is its place,

## Job 38:20

> That you would take it to its territory  
> And discern the paths to its home?

## Job 38:21

> You know, for you were born then,  
> And the number of your days is great!

---

## Job 38:22

> Have you entered the storehouses of the snow,  
> And have you seen the storehouses of the hail,

## Job 38:23

> Which I have reserved for a time of distress,  
> For a day of war and battle?

## Job 38:24

> Where is the way that the light is divided,  
> And the east wind scattered on the earth?

## Job 38:25

> Who has split a channel for the flood,  
> And a way for the thunderbolt,

## Job 38:26

> To bring rain on a land without people,  
> On a desert without a person in it,

## Job 38:27

> To satisfy the waste and desolate land,  
> And to make the seeds of grass sprout?

## Job 38:28

> Does the rain have a father?  
> Or who has fathered the drops of dew?

## Job 38:29

> From whose womb has come the ice?  
> And the frost of heaven, who has given it birth?

## Job 38:30

> Water becomes hard like stone,  
> And the surface of the deep is frozen.

---

## Job 38:31

> Can you tie up the chains of the Pleiades,  
> Or untie the cords of Orion?

## Job 38:32

> Can you bring out a constellation in its season,  
> And guide the Bear with her satellites?

## Job 38:33

> Do you know the ordinances of the heavens,  
> Or do you establish their rule over the earth?

---

## Job 38:34

> Can you raise your voice to the clouds,  
> So that an abundance of water will cover you?

## Job 38:35

> Can you send flashes of lightning, so that they may go  
> And say to you, ‘Here we are’?

## Job 38:36

> Who has put wisdom in the innermost being,  
> Or given understanding to the mind?

## Job 38:37

> Who can count the clouds by wisdom,  
> And pour out the water jars of the heavens,

## Job 38:38

> When the dust hardens into a mass  
> And the clods stick together?

---

## Job 38:39

> Can you hunt the prey for the lioness,  
> Or satisfy the appetite of young lions,

## Job 38:40

> When they crouch in their hiding places,  
> And lie in wait in their lair?

## Job 38:41

> Who prepares feed for the raven,  
> When its young cry to God,  
> And wander about without food?
