# Job Chapter 38

## Job 38:1

Then the Lord spoke to Job from the whirlwind and said:

## Job 38:2

> “Who is this that darkens my counsel
> with words devoid of knowledge?

## Job 38:3

> Gird yourself like a man;
> I will question you, and you shall inform me.

---

## Job 38:4

> Where were you when I established the earth’s foundation?
> Declare, if you have understanding.

## Job 38:5

> Who determined its measurements? Surely you know!
> Or who stretched the measuring line upon it?

## Job 38:6

> On what were its bases set,
> or who laid its cornerstone—

## Job 38:7

> when the morning stars sang in chorus
> and all the sons of God shouted for joy?

---

## Job 38:8

> “Who enclosed the sea with doors
> when it burst forth from the womb,

## Job 38:9

> when I clothed it with clouds
> and wrapped it in thick darkness,

## Job 38:10

> when I set limits for it
> and put bars and doors in place,

## Job 38:11

> when I said, ‘This far you may come and no farther;
> here is where your proud waves shall stop’?

---

## Job 38:12

> “Have you ever commanded the morning,
> or shown the dawn its place,

## Job 38:13

> that it might seize the edges of the earth
> and shake the wicked out of it?

## Job 38:14

> The earth takes form like clay under a seal;
> its features stand out like a garment.

## Job 38:15

> The light is withheld from the wicked,
> and the uplifted arm is broken.

---

## Job 38:16

> “Have you journeyed to the springs of the sea
> or walked in the depths of the ocean?

## Job 38:17

> Have the secrets of death been shown to you?
> Have you seen the gates of the shadowy realm?

## Job 38:18

> Have you comprehended the vast expanses of the earth?
> Declare, if you know all this.

---

## Job 38:19

> Where is the way to the dwelling of light?
> And where does darkness reside,

## Job 38:20

> that you may take it to its territory,
> and discern the paths to its abode?

## Job 38:21

> Surely you must know, for you were born by then,
> and your days are many!

---

## Job 38:22

> “Have you entered the treasuries of the snow
> or seen the reserves of the hail,

## Job 38:23

> which I have reserved for times of trouble,
> for days of war and battle?

## Job 38:24

> What is the way to the place where the light is divided,
> or the east wind scattered over the earth?

## Job 38:25

> Who has carved a channel for the torrents of rain,
> and a path for the thunderbolt,

## Job 38:26

> to water a land that is uninhabited,
> a deserted wilderness,

## Job 38:27

> to satisfy the desolate wasteland
> and cause the grass to sprout?

## Job 38:28

> Does the rain have a source?
> Who is the parent of the drops of dew?

## Job 38:29

> From whose womb does the ice come?
> Who gives birth to the frost from the heavens

## Job 38:30

> when the waters harden like stone,
> when the surface of the deep is frozen?

---

## Job 38:31

> “Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades,
> or loosen the cords of Orion?

## Job 38:32

> Can you bring forth the constellations in their
> seasons, or guide the Bear with her cubs?

## Job 38:33

> Are you familiar with the laws of the heavens?
> Can you establish their rule over the earth?

---

## Job 38:34

> “Can you call to the clouds
> and cover yourself with a deluge of water?

## Job 38:35

> Do you send the lightning bolts on their way?
> Do they present themselves to you, saying, ‘Here we are’?

## Job 38:36

> Who has placed wisdom within the heart,
> or given understanding to the mind?

## Job 38:37

> Who can count the clouds by wisdom,
> or tip over the water jars of the heavens

## Job 38:38

> when the dust becomes solid
> and the clods stick together?

---

## Job 38:39

> “Can you hunt the prey for the lioness
> and satisfy the hunger of the young lions

## Job 38:40

> when they crouch in their dens
> or lie in wait in their lairs?

## Job 38:41

> Who provides sustenance for the raven
> when its young cry out to God
> and wander about without food?
