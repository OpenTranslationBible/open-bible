> That there is still more to be said on God’s behalf.

## Job 36:3

> I will bring my knowledge from afar,  
> And ascribe righteousness to my Maker.

## Job 36:4

> For truly my words are not false;  
> One who is perfect in knowledge is with you.

## Job 36:5

> Behold, God is mighty but does not reject anyone;

> But gives justice to the afflicted.

## Job 36:7

> He does not withdraw His eyes from the righteous,  
> But with kings on the throne  
> He has seated them forever, and they are exalted.

## Job 36:8

> And if they are bound in shackles,  
> And are caught in the snares of misery,

## Job 36:9

> Then He declares to them their work  
> And their wrongdoings, that they have been arrogant.

## Job 36:10

> He opens their ears to instruction,  
> And commands that they return from injustice.

## Job 36:11

> If they listen and serve Him,  
> They will end their days in prosperity,  
> And their years in happiness.

## Job 36:12

> But if they do not listen, they will perish by the sword,  
> And die without knowledge.

## Job 36:13

> But the godless in heart accumulate anger;  
> They do not cry for help when He binds them.

## Job 36:14

> They die in youth,  
> And their life perishes among the cult prostitutes.

## Job 36:15

> He rescues the afflicted in their misery,  
> And opens their ears in time of oppression.

## Job 36:16

> Then indeed, He lured you away from the mouth of distress,  
> Instead of it, a broad place with no constraint;  
> And that which was set on your table was full of fatness.

## Job 36:17

> But you were full of judgment on the wicked;  
> Judgment and justice take hold of you.

## Job 36:18

> Beware that wrath does not entice you to mockery;  
> And do not let the greatness of the ransom turn you aside.

## Job 36:19

> Will your cry for help keep you from distress,  
> Or all the exertions of your strength?

## Job 36:20

> Do not long for the night,  
> When people vanish in their places.

## Job 36:21

> Be careful, do not turn to evil,  
> For you preferred this to misery.

## Job 36:22

> Behold, God is exalted in His power;  
> Who is a teacher like Him?

## Job 36:23

> Who has appointed Him His way,  
> And who has said, ‘You have done wrong’?

## Job 36:24

> Remember that you are to exalt His work,  
> Of which people have sung.

## Job 36:25

> All people have seen it;  
> Mankind looks at it from afar.

## Job 36:26

> Behold, God is exalted, and we do not know Him;  
> The number of His years is unsearchable.

## Job 36:27

> For He draws up the drops of water;  
> They distil rain from its celestial stream,

## Job 36:28

> Which clouds pour down;  
> They drip upon mankind abundantly.

## Job 36:29

> Can anyone understand the spreading of the clouds,  
> The thundering from His canopy?

## Job 36:30

> Behold, He spreads His lightning about Him,  
> And He covers the depths of the sea.

## Job 36:31

> He gives food in abundance.

## Job 36:32

> He covers His hands with the lightning,  
> And commands it to strike the target.

## Job 36:33

> Its rumbling declares His presence;  
> The livestock also, concerning what is coming.
