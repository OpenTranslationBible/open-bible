# Job Chapter 7

## Job 7:1

> “Is a human not forced to labour on earth,  
> And are his days not like the days of a hired worker?

## Job 7:2

> As a slave pants for the shade,  
> And as a hired worker who eagerly waits for his wages,

## Job 7:3

> So I am allotted worthless months,  
> And nights of trouble are apportioned to me.

## Job 7:4

> When I lie down I say, ‘When shall I arise?’  
> But the night continues,  
> And I am continually tossing until dawn.

## Job 7:5

> My flesh is clothed with maggots and a crust of dirt,  
> My skin hardens and oozes.

---

## Job 7:6

> My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle,  
> And they come to an end without hope.

## Job 7:7

> Remember that my life is a breath;  
> My eye will not again see good.

## Job 7:8

> The eye of him who sees me will no longer look at me;  
> Your eyes will be on me, but I will not exist.

## Job 7:9

> A cloud vanishes, and it is gone,  
> So one who goes down to Sheol does not come up.

## Job 7:10

> He will not return to his house again,  
> Nor will his place recognise him anymore.

## Job 7:11

> “Therefore I will not restrain my mouth;  
> I will speak in the anguish of my spirit,  
> I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.

## Job 7:12

> Am I the sea, or the sea monster,  
> That You set a guard over me?

## Job 7:13

> If I say, ‘My bed will comfort me,  
> My couch will ease my complaint,’

## Job 7:14

> Then You frighten me with dreams  
> And terrify me by visions,

## Job 7:15

> So that my soul would choose suffocation,  
> Death rather than my pain.

## Job 7:16

> I waste away; I will not live forever.  
> Leave me alone, for my days are only a breath.

---

## Job 7:17

> What is man, that You exalt him,  
> And that You are concerned about him,

## Job 7:18

> That You examine him every morning  
> And put him to the test every moment?

## Job 7:19

> Will You never look away from me,  
> Nor leave me alone until I swallow my spittle?

## Job 7:20

> Have I sinned? What have I done to You,  
> Watcher of mankind?  
> Why have You set me as Your target,  
> So that I am a burden to myself?

## Job 7:21

> Why then do You not pardon my wrongdoing  
> And take away my guilt?  
> For now I will lie down in the dust;  
> And You will search for me, but I will not be.”
