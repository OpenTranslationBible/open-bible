# Job Chapter 7

## Job 7:1

> “Is a human not forced to labour on earth,  
> And are his days not like the days of a hired worker?

## Job 7:2

> Just as a servant longs for the shade,  
> And like a labourer who eagerly awaits his wages,

## Job 7:3

> So I am given months of futility,  
> And nights filled with trouble are assigned to me.

## Job 7:4

> When I lie down, I ask, ‘When will I get up?’  
> But the night drags on,  
> And I am restless until dawn.

## Job 7:5

> My flesh is covered with worms and clods of dust,  
> My skin hardens and breaks out.

---

## Job 7:6

> My days pass more swiftly than a weaver’s shuttle,  
> And they conclude without hope.

## Job 7:7

> Remember that my life is but a breath;  
> My eye will not see good again.

## Job 7:8

> The eye of him who sees me will see me no more;  
> Your eyes will be upon me, but I will be gone.

## Job 7:9

> A cloud vanishes, and it is no more,  
> So one who descends to Sheol does not return.

## Job 7:10

> He will not come back to his house again,  
> Nor will his place acknowledge him anymore.

---

## Job 7:11

> “Thus, I will not hold back my words;  
> I will speak out in the distress of my spirit,  
> I will express my sorrow in the bitterness of my soul.

## Job 7:12

> Am I the sea, or a sea creature,  
> That You place a guard over me?

## Job 7:13

> If I think, ‘My bed will comfort me,  
> My couch will relieve my complaint,’

## Job 7:14

> Then You alarm me with dreams  
> And terrify me with visions,

## Job 7:15

> So that my soul would prefer suffocation,  
> Death rather than my suffering.

## Job 7:16

> I am wasting away; I will not live forever.  
> Leave me be, for my days are but a breath.

---

## Job 7:17

> What is man, that You honour him,  
> And that You care for him,

## Job 7:18

> That You observe him every morning  
> And test him at every moment?

## Job 7:19

> Will You never turn Your gaze away from me,  
> Nor leave me alone until I swallow my spit?

## Job 7:20

> Have I sinned? What have I done to You,  
> Keeper of mankind?  
> Why have You made me Your target,  
> So that I am a burden to myself?

## Job 7:21

> Why then do You not forgive my transgression  
> And take away my iniquity?  
> For now I will lie down in the dust;  
> And You will search for me, but I will be no more.”
