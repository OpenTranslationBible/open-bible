# Job Chapter 35

## Job 35:1

Then Elihu continued and said,

## Job 35:2

> “Do you think this is in accordance with justice?  
> Do you say, ‘My righteousness is more than God’s’?

## Job 35:3

> For you say, ‘What advantage will it be to You?  
> What benefit will I have, more than if I had sinned?’

---

## Job 35:4

> I will answer you,  
> And your friends with you.

## Job 35:5

> Look at the heavens and see;  
> And look at the clouds—they are higher than you.

## Job 35:6

> If you have sinned, what do you accomplish against Him?  
> And if your wrongdoings are many, what do you do to Him?

## Job 35:7

> If you are righteous, what do you give to Him,  
> Or what does He receive from your hand?

## Job 35:8

> Your wickedness is for a man like yourself,  
> And your righteousness is for a son of man.

---

## Job 35:9

> Because of the multitude of oppressions they cry out;  
> They cry for help because of the arm of the mighty.

## Job 35:10

> But no one says, ‘Where is God my Maker,  
> Who gives songs in the night,

## Job 35:11

> Who teaches us more than the animals of the earth  
> And makes us wiser than the birds of the sky?’

## Job 35:12

> There they cry out, but He does not answer  
> Because of the pride of evil people.

## Job 35:13

> God certainly will not listen to an empty cry,  
> Nor will the Almighty regard it.

## Job 35:14

> How much less, when you say you do not look at Him,  
> when your case is before Him, you must wait for Him!

## Job 35:15

> But now, because He has not punished in anger,  
> nor acknowledged the arrogance,

## Job 35:16

> Yet Job opens his mouth with empty words;  
> and multiplies his words without knowledge.
