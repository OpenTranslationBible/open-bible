# Job Chapter 35

## Job 35:1

Then Elihu continued and spoke:

## Job 35:2

> “Do you consider this to be just?
> You claim, ‘My righteousness surpasses God’s.’

## Job 35:3

> For you ask, ‘What benefit is it to me?
> What do I gain more than if I had sinned?’

---

## Job 35:4

> I shall respond to you
> and your companions.

## Job 35:5

> Observe the heavens and see;
> look at the clouds, they are far above you.

## Job 35:6

> If you sin, what effect does it have on Him?
> If your transgressions are many, how do they affect Him?

## Job 35:7

> If you are righteous, what do you offer Him,
> or what does He take from your hand?

## Job 35:8

> Your wickedness affects only humans like yourself,
> and your righteousness impacts only fellow people.

---

## Job 35:9

> “People cry out under the weight of oppression;
> they seek relief from the power of the mighty.

## Job 35:10

> Yet no one asks, ‘Where is God my Maker,
> who provides songs in the night,

## Job 35:11

> who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth
> and makes us wiser than the birds of the sky?’

## Job 35:12

> They cry out, but He does not answer
> because of the arrogance of the wicked.

## Job 35:13

> Indeed, God will not heed an empty plea;
> the Almighty pays no attention to it.

## Job 35:14

> How much less will He listen when you claim you do not see Him,
> that your case is before Him, and you must wait for Him.

## Job 35:15

> And now, because He has not punished in His anger,
> nor has He regarded wrongdoing,

## Job 35:16

> So Job speaks with empty words;
> he multiplies words without understanding.”
