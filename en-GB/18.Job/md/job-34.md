# Job Chapter 34

## Job 34:1

Then Elihu continued and said,

## Job 34:2

> “Hear my words, you wise men,  
> And listen to me, you who understand.

## Job 34:3

> For the ear tests words  
> As the palate tastes food.

## Job 34:4

> Let us choose for ourselves what is right;  
> Let us understand among ourselves what is good.

---

## Job 34:5

> For Job has said, ‘I am righteous,  
> But God has taken away my right;

## Job 34:6

> Should I lie about my right?  
> My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.’

## Job 34:7

> What man is like Job,  
> Who drinks up derision like water,

## Job 34:8

> Who goes in company with the workers of injustice,  
> And walks with wicked people?

## Job 34:9

> For he has said, ‘It is of no use to a man  
> When he is pleased with God.’

---

## Job 34:10

> “Therefore, listen to me, you men of understanding.  
> Far be it from God to do evil,  
> And from the Almighty to do wrong.

## Job 34:11

> For He repays a person for his work,  
> And lets things happen in correspondence to a man’s behaviour.

## Job 34:12

> Surely, God will not act wickedly,  
> And the Almighty will not pervert justice.

## Job 34:13

> Who gave Him authority over the earth?  
> And who has laid on Him the whole world?

## Job 34:14

> If He were to determine to do so,  
> If He were to gather His spirit and His breath to Himself,

## Job 34:15

> All flesh would perish together,  
> And mankind would return to dust.

---

## Job 34:16

> “But if you have understanding, hear this;  
> Listen to the sound of my words.

## Job 34:17

> Shall one who hates justice rule?  
> And will you condemn the righteous mighty One,

## Job 34:18

> Who says to a king, ‘You worthless one,’  
> To nobles, ‘You wicked ones,’

## Job 34:19

> Who shows no partiality to the prominent,  
> Nor regards the rich above the poor,  
> Since they all are the work of His hands?

## Job 34:20

> In a moment they die,  
> And at midnight people are shaken and pass away,  
> And the powerful are taken away without a hand.

---

## Job 34:21

> For His eyes are upon the ways of a person,  
> And He sees all his steps.

## Job 34:22

> There is no darkness or deep shadow  
> Where the workers of injustice can hide themselves.

## Job 34:23

> For He does not need to consider a person further,  
> That he should go before God in judgment.

## Job 34:24

> He breaks the mighty without investigation,  
> And sets others in their place.

## Job 34:25

> Therefore He knows their deeds,  
> And He overthrows them in the night, and they are crushed.

## Job 34:26

> He strikes them like the wicked  
> In a public place,

## Job 34:27

> Because they turned aside from following Him,  
> And had no regard for any of His ways;

## Job 34:28

> So that they caused the cry of the poor to come to Him,  
> And He heard the cry of the afflicted.

## Job 34:29

> When He keeps quiet, who then can condemn?  
> And when He hides His face, who then can behold Him,  
> That is, in regard to both a nation and a man?—

## Job 34:30

> So that godless people would not rule,  
> Nor be snares to the people.

---

## Job 34:31

> “For has anyone said to God,  
> ‘I have endured punishment; I will not offend anymore;

## Job 34:32

> Teach me what I do not see;  
> If I have done wrong, I will not do it again’?

## Job 34:33

> Shall God repay on your terms, because you have rejected it?  
> For you must choose, and not I;  
> Therefore declare what you know.

---

## Job 34:34

> Men of understanding will say to me,  
> And a wise man who hears me,

## Job 34:35

> ‘Job speaks without knowledge,  
> And his words are without wisdom.

## Job 34:36

> Oh that Job were tested to the limit,  
> Because he answers like men of wickedness.

## Job 34:37

> For he adds rebellion to his sin;  
> He claps his hands among us,  
> And multiplies his words against God.’”
