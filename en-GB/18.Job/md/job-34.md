# Job Chapter 34

## Job 34:1

Then Elihu continued and spoke:

## Job 34:2

> “Hear my words, you wise men,
> and listen to me, you men of understanding.

## Job 34:3

> For the ear tests words
> as the palate tastes food.

## Job 34:4

> Let us choose for ourselves what is right;
> let us discern together what is good.

---

## Job 34:5

> For Job has said, ‘I am righteous,
> but God has denied me justice.

## Job 34:6

> Though I am without fault, I am considered a liar;
> my wound is incurable, though I am guiltless.’

## Job 34:7

> What man is like Job,
> who drinks derision like water,

## Job 34:8

> who associates with evildoers
> and walks with the wicked?

## Job 34:9

> For he has said, ‘There is no benefit to a man
> in trying to please God.’

## Job 34:10

> “Therefore, listen to me, you men of understanding.
> It is far from God to do evil,
> and from the Almighty to do wrong.

## Job 34:11

> He repays a person according to their deeds,
> and brings upon them what their conduct deserves.

## Job 34:12

> It is unimaginable that God would act wickedly,
> or that the Almighty would pervert justice.

## Job 34:13

> Who gave Him authority over the earth?
> Who placed the whole world in His care?

## Job 34:14

> If He were to gather His spirit
> and breath to Himself,

## Job 34:15

> all humanity would perish together,
> and mankind would return to dust.

## Job 34:16

> “If you have understanding, hear this;
> listen to the sound of my words.

## Job 34:17

> Can one who hates justice govern?
> Will you condemn the righteous and mighty One?

## Job 34:18

> Is He not the One who says to kings, ‘You are worthless,’
> and to nobles, ‘You are wicked,’

## Job 34:19

> who shows no partiality to princes
> and does not favour the rich over the poor,
> for they are all the work of His hands?

## Job 34:20

> In a moment they die,
> in the middle of the night; people are shaken and pass away,
> and the powerful are removed without human hand.

---

## Job 34:21

> “For His eyes are on the ways of mortals;
> He sees their every step.

## Job 34:22

> There is no darkness or deep shadow
> where evildoers can hide themselves.

## Job 34:23

> God does not need to examine people further,
> that they should come before Him for judgment.

## Job 34:24

> Without inquiry, He shatters the mighty
> and sets others in their place.

## Job 34:25

> Because He takes note of their deeds,
> He overthrows them in the night and they are crushed.

## Job 34:26

> He strikes them for their wickedness
> in a public place,

## Job 34:27

> because they turned away from following Him
> and had no regard for any of His ways.

## Job 34:28

> They caused the cry of the poor to come before Him,
> so that He heard the cry of the afflicted.

## Job 34:29

> When He remains silent, who can condemn Him?
> If He hides His face, who can see Him?
> He is over both nation and individual alike,

## Job 34:30

> to prevent the godless from ruling
> and laying snares for the people.

---

## Job 34:31

> “For has anyone said to God,
> ‘I have endured punishment; I will offend no more;

## Job 34:32

> teach me what I do not see;
> if I have done wrong, I will not do it again’?

## Job 34:33

> Should God repay on your terms because you reject His?
> You must choose, not I;
> therefore, declare what you know.

---

## Job 34:34

> Men of understanding will say to me,
> and a wise man who hears me will say,

## Job 34:35

> ‘Job speaks without knowledge;
> his words lack wisdom.’

## Job 34:36

> Oh, that Job might be tested to the utmost,
> for answering like a wicked man!

## Job 34:37

> For he adds rebellion to his sin;
> he claps his hands among us
> and multiplies his words against God.”
