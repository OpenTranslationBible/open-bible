# Job Chapter 15

## Job 15:1

Then Eliphaz the Temanite spoke:

## Job 15:2

> “Should a wise person respond with empty ideas,
> and fill themselves with the hot east wind?

## Job 15:3

> Should they engage in fruitless talk,
> with words that bring no benefit?

## Job 15:4

> You indeed diminish reverence
> and obstruct meditation before God.

## Job 15:5

> Your wrongdoing instructs your speech,
> and you choose the tongue of the crafty.

## Job 15:6

> Your own mouth condemns you, not I;
> your own lips bear witness against you.

## Job 15:7

> “Were you the first human ever born?
> Were you brought forth before the hills?

## Job 15:8

> Do you listen in on God’s secret council?
> Do you claim exclusive wisdom?

## Job 15:9

> What do you know that we do not?
> What insights do you possess that we lack?

## Job 15:10

> The grey-haired and the aged are among us,
> older than your father.

## Job 15:11

> Are the consolations of God too small for you,
> or the gentle word spoken to you?

## Job 15:12

> Why does your heart lead you astray,
> and why do your eyes flash,

## Job 15:13

> that you turn your spirit against God
> and utter such words?

## Job 15:14

> What is humanity, that they could be pure,
> or those born of a woman, that they could be righteous?

## Job 15:15

> If He places no trust in His holy ones,
> and even the heavens are not pure in His sight,

## Job 15:16

> how much less mortals, who are vile and corrupt,
> who drink iniquity like water!

## Job 15:17

> “Listen to me and I will explain;
> I will declare what I have observed,

## Job 15:18

> what the wise have proclaimed,
> and have not concealed from their ancestors,

## Job 15:19

> to whom alone the land was given
> when no stranger passed among them:

## Job 15:20

> The wicked person suffers torment all their days,
> and the years reserved for the ruthless are limited.

## Job 15:21

> Terrifying sounds fill his ears;
> when he is at peace, marauders attack him.

## Job 15:22

> He does not expect to escape from darkness;
> he is destined for the sword.

## Job 15:23

> He wanders for food, saying, ‘Where is it?’
> He knows the day of darkness is near.

## Job 15:24

> Distress and anguish terrify him;
> they overpower him like a king ready for battle,

## Job 15:25

> because he has stretched out his hand against God,
> and shown arrogance towards the Almighty.

## Job 15:26

> He charges defiantly at Him with a thick, strong shield.

## Job 15:27

> Though his face is covered with fat
> and his waist bulges with flesh,

## Job 15:28

> he will dwell in desolate cities,
> in houses no one inhabits,
> destined to become ruins.

## Job 15:29

> He will not remain wealthy, nor will his riches endure;
> his possessions will not spread across the land.

## Job 15:30

> He will not escape the darkness;
> a flame will wither his shoots,
> and the breath of God’s mouth will carry him away.

## Job 15:31

> Let him not deceive himself
> by trusting in vanity, for he will receive nothing in return.

## Job 15:32

> It will be fulfilled before his time,
> and his branches will not flourish.

## Job 15:33

> He will be like a vine stripped of its unripe grapes,
> like an olive tree shedding its blossoms.

## Job 15:34

> For the company of the godless is barren,
> and fire consumes the tents of those who love bribes.

## Job 15:35

> They conceive trouble and give birth to wrongdoing;
> their mind prepares deceit.”
