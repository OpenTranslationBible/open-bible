Then Job answered,

## Job 23:2

> “Today also my complaint is bitter;
> His hand is heavy despite my sighing.

## Job 23:3

> If only I knew how to find Him,
> that I might reach His dwelling!

## Job 23:4

> I would lay my case before Him
> and fill my mouth with arguments.

## Job 23:5

> I would know the words He would reply to me,
> and consider what He would say.

## Job 23:6

> Would He oppose me with great power?
> No, He would surely give heed to me.

## Job 23:7

> There the upright could reason with Him,
> and I would be delivered forever from my judge.

## Job 23:8

> “Behold, I go east but He is not there,
> and west, but I cannot find Him;

## Job 23:9

> When He works in the north, I do not see Him;
> He turns to the south, but I do not behold Him.

## Job 23:10

> Yet He knows the path I take;
> when He has tested me, I shall emerge as gold.

## Job 23:11

> My feet have held fast to His steps; I have kept His way and not turned aside.

## Job 23:12

> I have not departed from the command of His lips;
> I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my daily sustenance.

## Job 23:13

> But He is unchangeable, and who can turn Him?
> He does whatever He desires.

## Job 23:14

> He will complete what He has planned for me,
> and many such things are with Him.

## Job 23:15

> Therefore, I am terrified at His presence;
> when I consider this, I am in dread of Him.

## Job 23:16

> It is God who has made my heart faint,
> and the Almighty who has frightened me,

## Job 23:17

> Yet I am not silenced by the darkness,
> nor by the deep gloom that covers my face.
