# Job Chapter 32

## Job 32:1

Thus, the three men ceased responding to Job, for he was righteous in his own eyes.

## Job 32:2

However, Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, from the family of Ram, was incensed with Job because he justified himself rather than God.

## Job 32:3

His anger also kindled against the three friends, as they had found no answer to refute Job, yet they had condemned him.

## Job 32:4

Elihu had held back from speaking to Job because they were older than he.

## Job 32:5

But when Elihu observed that the three men had no further responses, his anger was ignited.

## Job 32:6

So Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite declared:

> “I am young in years, and you are aged;
> hence, I was timid and refrained from expressing my thoughts.

## Job 32:7

> I thought, ‘Let age speak,
> and let many years impart wisdom.’

## Job 32:8

> But it is the spirit in a person,
> the breath of the Almighty, that bestows understanding.

## Job 32:9

> It is not just the elderly who are wise,
> nor is it only the aged who comprehend justice.

## Job 32:10

> Therefore, I say: ‘Hear me out;
> I too will share what I know.’

## Job 32:11

> I waited for your words,
> I listened to your considered speech,
> while you searched for what to say.

## Job 32:12

> I gave you my full attention.
> Yet not one of you has proven Job wrong;
> none has answered his arguments.

## Job 32:13

> Therefore, do not claim, ‘We have discovered wisdom;
> let God, not man, defeat him.’

## Job 32:14

> But Job has not directed his words against me,
> and I will not respond to him with your arguments.

---

## Job 32:15

> They are dismayed and have ceased to answer;
> words have left them.

## Job 32:16

> Should I wait, now that they are silent,
> now that they stand without a reply?

## Job 32:17

> I too will have my say;
> I also will share my thoughts.

## Job 32:18

> For I am full of words,
> and the spirit within me compels me.

## Job 32:19

> Inside, I am like wine that has no vent,
> like new wineskins ready to burst.

## Job 32:20

> I must speak to find relief;
> I must open my lips and respond.

## Job 32:21

> I will show no partiality,
> nor will I flatter any man.

## Job 32:22

> For I do not know how to flatter;
> if I did, my Maker would swiftly take me away.
