## Job 22:1

Then Eliphaz the Temanite responded,

## Job 22:2

> “Can a strong man be of use to God,  
> Or a wise one be useful to himself?

## Job 22:3

> Is it any pleasure to the Almighty if you are righteous,  
> Or gain to Him if you make your ways blameless?

---

## Job 22:4

> Is it because of your reverence that He punishes you,  
> That He enters into judgment against you?

## Job 22:5

> Is your wickedness not abundant,  
> And is there no end to your guilty deeds?

## Job 22:6

> For you have seized pledges from your brothers without cause,  
> And stripped people naked.

## Job 22:7

> You have given no water to the weary to drink,  
> And you have withheld bread from the hungry.

## Job 22:8

> But the earth belongs to the powerful man,  
> And the one who is honourable lives on it.

## Job 22:9

> You have sent widows away empty,  
> And the strength of orphans has been crushed.

## Job 22:10

> Therefore traps surround you,  
> And sudden dread terrifies you,

## Job 22:11

> Or darkness, so that you cannot see,  
> And a flood of water covers you.

## Job 22:12

> Is God not in the height of heaven?  
> Look also at the distant stars, how high they are!

## Job 22:13

> You say, ‘What does God know?  
> Can He judge through the thick darkness?

## Job 22:14

> Clouds are a hiding place for Him, so that He cannot see;  
> And He walks on the vault of heaven.’

## Job 22:15

> Will you keep to the ancient path  
> Which wicked people have walked,

## Job 22:16

> Who were snatched away before their time,  
> Whose foundations were washed away by a river?

## Job 22:17

> They said to God, ‘Go away from us!’  
> And ‘What can the Almighty do to us?’

## Job 22:18

> Yet He filled their houses with good things;  
> But the plan of the wicked is far from me.

## Job 22:19

> The righteous see and are glad,  
> And the innocent mock them, saying,

## Job 22:20

> ‘Truly our enemies are eliminated,  
> And fire has consumed their abundance.’

## Job 22:21

> “Be reconciled with Him, and be at peace;  
> Thereby good will come to you.

## Job 22:22

> Please receive instruction from His mouth,  
> And put His words in your heart.

## Job 22:23

> If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored;  
> If you remove injustice far from your tent,

## Job 22:24

> And put your gold in the dust,  
> And the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks,

## Job 22:25

> Then the Almighty will be your gold  
> And abundant silver to you.

## Job 22:26

> For then you will take pleasure in the Almighty,  
> And lift up your face to God.

## Job 22:27

> You will pray to Him, and He will hear you;  
> And you will pay your vows.

## Job 22:28

> You will also decide something, and it will be established for you;  
> And light will shine on your ways.

## Job 22:29

> When you are cast down, you will speak with confidence,  
> And the humble person He will save.

## Job 22:30

> He will rescue one who is not innocent,  
> And he will be rescued due to the cleanness of your hands.”
