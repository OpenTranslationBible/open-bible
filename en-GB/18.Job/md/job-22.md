# Job Chapter 22

## Job 22:1

Now Eliphaz the Temanite spoke,

## Job 22:2

> “Can a man be of any use to God?
> Can a wise person be beneficial to himself?

## Job 22:3

> Does it bring any pleasure to the Almighty if you are righteous,
> or any gain if your ways are perfect?

---

## Job 22:4

> Is it because of your reverence that He corrects you
> and enters into judgement with you?

## Job 22:5

> Is not your wickedness vast,
> and are not your iniquities without end?

## Job 22:6

> For you have taken pledges from your kin without cause
> and stripped the naked of their clothing.

## Job 22:7

> You have not given water to the weary to drink,
> and you have withheld bread from the hungry.

## Job 22:8

> But the land belongs to the powerful,
> and the honourable dwell on it.

## Job 22:9

> You have sent widows away empty-handed,
> and the strength of the fatherless has been crushed.

## Job 22:10

> That is why snares are around you,
> and sudden terror overwhelms you,

## Job 22:11

> or darkness so that you cannot see,
> and a flood of waters covers you.

---

## Job 22:12

> “Is not God in the heights of heaven?
> And behold the highest stars, how lofty they are!

## Job 22:13

> Yet you say, ‘What does God know?
> Can He judge through the thick darkness?

## Job 22:14

> Clouds are a covering for Him, so that He does not see us,
> and He walks on the vault of heaven.’

## Job 22:15

> Will you continue on the ancient path
> that the wicked have trodden,

## Job 22:16

> who were carried away before their time,
> whose foundations were swept away by a flood?

## Job 22:17

> They said to God, ‘Depart from us!’
> and ‘What can the Almighty do to them?’

## Job 22:18

> Yet it was He who filled their houses with good things,
> but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.

## Job 22:19

> The righteous see it and are glad,
> and the innocent mock them, saying,

## Job 22:20

> ‘Surely our adversaries are cut off,
> and fire consumes their wealth.’

---

## Job 22:21

> “Acquaint yourself with Him and be at peace;
> thereby good will come to you.

## Job 22:22

> Receive instruction from His mouth
> and lay up His words in your heart.

## Job 22:23

> If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored;
> if you remove iniquity far from your tent,

## Job 22:24

> and cast your gold to the dust,
> the gold of Ophir to the stones of the brooks,

## Job 22:25

> then the Almighty will be your treasure,
> and precious silver to you.

## Job 22:26

> For then you will delight in the Almighty
> and lift up your face to God.

## Job 22:27

> You will pray to Him, and He will hear you,
> and you will fulfil your vows.

## Job 22:28

> You will decree a thing, and it will be established for you,
> and light will shine on your ways.

## Job 22:29

> When people are humbled, you will say,
> ‘Lift them up!’ and He will save the lowly.

## Job 22:30

> He will deliver even the guilty,
> who will be saved by the cleanness of your hands.”
