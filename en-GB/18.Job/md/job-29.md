# Job Chapter 29

## Job 29:1

Then Job again took up his discourse and said,

## Job 29:2

> “Oh that I were as in months gone by,  
> As in the days when God watched over me;

## Job 29:3

> When His lamp shone over my head,  
> And by His light I walked through darkness;

## Job 29:4

> Just as I was in the days of my youth,  
> When the protection of God was over my tent;

## Job 29:5

> When the Almighty was still with me,  
> And my children were around me;

## Job 29:6

> When my steps were bathed in butter,  
> And the rock poured out streams of oil for me!

## Job 29:7

> When I went out to the gate of the city,  
> When I took my seat in the public square,

## Job 29:8

> The young men saw me and hid,  
> And the old men arose and stood.

## Job 29:9

> The leaders stopped talking  
> And put their hands on their mouths;

## Job 29:10

> The voices of the nobles were hushed,  
> And their tongues stuck to their palates.

## Job 29:11

> For when an ear heard, it called me blessed,  
> And when an eye saw, it gave witness of me,

## Job 29:12

> Because I saved the poor who cried for help,  
> And the orphan who had no helper.

## Job 29:13

> The blessing of the one who was about to perish came upon me,  
> And I made the widow’s heart sing for joy.

## Job 29:14

> I put on righteousness, and it clothed me;  
> My justice was like a robe and a headband.

## Job 29:15

> I was eyes to the blind,  
> And feet to the lame.

## Job 29:16

> I was a father to the needy,  
> And I investigated the case which I did not know.

## Job 29:17

> I broke the jaws of the wicked,  
> And rescued the prey from his teeth.

## Job 29:18

> Then I thought, ‘I will die with my family,  
> And I will multiply my days as the sand.

## Job 29:19

> My roots spread out to the waters,  
> And dew lies on my branches all night.

## Job 29:20

> My glory is ever new with me,  
> And my bow is renewed in my hand.’

---

## Job 29:21

> To me they listened and waited,  
> And kept silent for my advice.

## Job 29:22

> After my words they did not speak again,  
> And my speech dropped on them.

## Job 29:23

> They waited for me as for the rain,  
> And opened their mouths as for the late rain.

## Job 29:24

> I smiled at them when they did not believe,  
> And they did not look at the light of my face unkindly.

## Job 29:25

> I chose a way for them and sat as chief,  
> And lived as a king among the troops,  
> As one who comforted the mourners.
