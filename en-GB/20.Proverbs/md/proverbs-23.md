# Proverbs Chapter 23

## Proverbs 23:1

When you sit down to dine with a ruler,  
Consider carefully what is before you,

## Proverbs 23:2

And put a knife to your throat  
If you are a person of great appetite.

## Proverbs 23:3

Do not desire his delicacies,  
For it is deceptive food.

---

## Proverbs 23:4

Do not weary yourself to gain wealth;  
Stop dwelling on it.

## Proverbs 23:5

When you set your eyes on it, it is gone.  
For wealth certainly makes itself wings  
Like an eagle that flies toward the heavens.

---

## Proverbs 23:6

Do not eat the bread of a selfish person,  
Or desire his delicacies;

## Proverbs 23:7

For as he thinks within himself, so he is.  
“Eat and drink!” he says to you,  
But his heart is not with you.

## Proverbs 23:8

You will vomit up the morsel you have eaten  
And waste your pleasant words.

---

## Proverbs 23:9

Do not speak in the ears of a fool,  
For he will despise the wisdom of your words.

---

## Proverbs 23:10

Do not move the ancient boundary  
Or go into the fields of the fatherless;

## Proverbs 23:11

For their Redeemer is strong;  
He will plead their case against you.

---

## Proverbs 23:12

Apply your heart to discipline  
And your ears to words of knowledge.

---

## Proverbs 23:13

Do not withhold discipline from a child;  
Though you strike him with the rod, he will not die.

## Proverbs 23:14

You shall strike him with the rod  
And rescue his soul from Sheol.

---

## Proverbs 23:15

My son, if your heart is wise,  
My own heart also will be glad;

## Proverbs 23:16

And my innermost being will rejoice  
When your lips speak what is right.

---

## Proverbs 23:17

Do not let your heart envy sinners,  
But live in the fear of the Lord always.

## Proverbs 23:18

Certainly there is a future,  
And your hope will not be cut off.

---

## Proverbs 23:19

Listen, my son, and be wise,  
And direct your heart in the way.

## Proverbs 23:20

Do not be with heavy drinkers of wine,  
Or with gluttonous eaters of meat;

## Proverbs 23:21

For the heavy drinker and the glutton will come to poverty,  
And drowsiness will clothe one with rags.

---

## Proverbs 23:22

Listen to your father, who fathered you,  
And do not despise your mother when she is old.

## Proverbs 23:23

Buy truth, and do not sell it,  
Get wisdom, instruction, and understanding.

## Proverbs 23:24

The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice,  
And he who fathers a wise son will be glad in him.

## Proverbs 23:25

Let your father and your mother be glad,  
And let her rejoice who gave birth to you.

---

## Proverbs 23:26

Give me your heart, my son,  
And let your eyes delight in my ways.

## Proverbs 23:27

For a prostitute is a deep pit,  
And a strange woman is a narrow well.

## Proverbs 23:28

Surely she lurks as a robber,  
And increases the treacherous among mankind.

---

## Proverbs 23:29

Who has woe? Who has sorrow?  
Who has contentions? Who has complaints?  
Who has wounds without cause?  
Who has red eyes?

## Proverbs 23:30

Those who linger long over wine,  
Those who go to taste mixed wine.

## Proverbs 23:31

Do not look at wine when it is red,  
When it sparkles in the cup,  
When it goes down smoothly;

## Proverbs 23:32

In the end it bites like a serpent,  
And stings like a viper.

## Proverbs 23:33

Your eyes will see strange things,  
And your mind will speak perverse things.

## Proverbs 23:34

And you will be like one who lies down in the middle of the sea,  
Or like one who lies down on the top of a mast.

## Proverbs 23:35

“They struck me, but I did not become ill;  
They beat me, but I did not know it.  
When will I awake?  
I will seek another drink.”
