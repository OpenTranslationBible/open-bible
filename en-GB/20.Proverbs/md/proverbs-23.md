# Proverbs Chapter 23

## Proverbs 23:1

When you sit to dine with a ruler, pay careful attention to what is set before you,

## Proverbs 23:6

Do not eat the bread of a begrudging host, nor desire his delicacies;

## Proverbs 23:7

for just as he thinks within himself, so he is. He says to you, “Eat and drink,” but his heart is not truly with you.

## Proverbs 23:8

You will vomit up the morsel you have eaten and squander your compliments.

## Proverbs 23:9

Do not speak in the hearing of a fool, for he will scorn the wisdom of your words.

## Proverbs 23:10

Do not move an ancient boundary stone or encroach upon the fields of the fatherless,

## Proverbs 23:11

for their Defender is strong; he will take up their cause against you.

## Proverbs 23:12

Commit yourself to instruction and listen to words of knowledge.

## Proverbs 23:13

Do not withhold discipline from a child; if you strike them with the rod, they will not die.

## Proverbs 23:14

Strike them with the rod and rescue their soul from Sheol.

## Proverbs 23:15

My son, if your heart is wise, then my heart will be glad indeed;

## Proverbs 23:16

my deepest being will rejoice when your lips speak what is right.

## Proverbs 23:17

Do not let your heart envy sinners, but always be zealous for the fear of the Lord.

## Proverbs 23:18

Surely there is a future hope for you, and your hope will not be cut off.

## Proverbs 23:19

Listen, my son, and be wise, and direct your heart in the right way:

## Proverbs 23:20

Do not be among those who drink too much wine or gorge themselves on meat,

## Proverbs 23:21

for drunkards and gluttons will come to poverty, and drowsiness will clothe them in rags.

## Proverbs 23:22

Pay attention to your father, who gave you life, and do not despise your mother when she is old.

## Proverbs 23:23

Buy the truth and do not sell it; acquire wisdom, instruction, and understanding.

## Proverbs 23:24

The father of a righteous child will have great joy; he who fathers a wise son will rejoice in him.

## Proverbs 23:25

Let your father and mother be glad; let her who gave you birth rejoice.

## Proverbs 23:26

My son, give me your heart and let your eyes take pleasure in my ways,

## Proverbs 23:27

for a promiscuous woman is a deep pit, and a wayward wife is a narrow well.

## Proverbs 23:28

She lurks like a bandit and increases the unfaithful among men.

## Proverbs 23:29

Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has strife? Who has complaints? Who has needless bruises? Who has bloodshot eyes?

## Proverbs 23:30

Those who linger long over wine, who go to sample mixed wine.

## Proverbs 23:31

Do not be captivated by wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup, when it goes down smoothly;

## Proverbs 23:32

for in the end it bites like a serpent and stings like a viper.

## Proverbs 23:33

Your eyes will see peculiar things, and your mind will speak distorted things.

## Proverbs 23:34

You will be like one sleeping on the high seas, lying on top of the mast.

## Proverbs 23:35

“They struck me,” you will say, “but I was not hurt! They beat me, but I did not feel it! When will I wake up so I can find another drink?”
