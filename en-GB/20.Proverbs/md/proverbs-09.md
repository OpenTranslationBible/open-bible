# Proverbs Chapter 9

## Proverbs 9:1

Wisdom has built her house,  
She has carved out her seven pillars;

## Proverbs 9:2

She has prepared her food,  
She has mixed her wine;  
> She has also set her table;

## Proverbs 9:3

She has sent out her maidens,  
She calls from the tops of the heights of the city:

## Proverbs 9:4

“Whoever is naive, let him turn in here!”  
To those who lack understanding she says,

## Proverbs 9:5

“Come, eat of my food  
And drink of the wine I have mixed.

## Proverbs 9:6

Abandon your foolishness and live,  
And proceed in the way of understanding.”

## Proverbs 9:7

One who corrects a scoffer gets dishonour for himself,  
And one who rebukes a wicked person gets insults for himself.

## Proverbs 9:8

Do not rebuke a scoffer, or he will hate you;  
> Rebuke a wise person and he will love you.

## Proverbs 9:9

Give instruction to a wise person and he will become still wiser;  
> Teach a righteous person and he will increase in learning.

## Proverbs 9:10

The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,  
And the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.

## Proverbs 9:11

For by me your days will be multiplied,  
And years of life will be added to you.

## Proverbs 9:12

If you are wise, you are wise for yourself,  
And if you scoff, you alone will suffer for it.

## Proverbs 9:13

A woman of foolishness is boisterous,  
She is naive and knows nothing.

## Proverbs 9:14

She sits at the doorway of her house,  
On a seat by the high places of the city,

## Proverbs 9:15

Calling to those who pass by,  
Who are making their paths straight:

## Proverbs 9:16

“Whoever is naive, let him turn in here!”  
To those who lack understanding she says,

## Proverbs 9:17

“Stolen water is sweet,  
And bread eaten in secret is pleasant.”

## Proverbs 9:18

But he does not know that the dead are there,  
That her guests are in the depths of Sheol.
