## Proverbs 7:7

## Proverbs 7:8

## Proverbs 7:22

Suddenly he follows her as an ox goes to the slaughter,

## Proverbs 7:23

until an arrow pierces his liver;

> as a bird rushes into a snare,
> not knowing it will cost him his life.

## Proverbs 7:26

For she has brought down many victims; her slain are a vast multitude.

## Proverbs 7:27

Her house is a highway to the grave, descending to the chambers of death.
