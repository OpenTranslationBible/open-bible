# Proverbs Chapter 7

## Proverbs 7:1

My son, keep my words  
And treasure my commandments within you.

## Proverbs 7:2

Keep my commandments and live,  
And my teaching as the apple of your eye.

## Proverbs 7:3

Bind them on your fingers;  
Write them on the tablet of your heart.

## Proverbs 7:4

Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,”  
And call understanding your close friend;

## Proverbs 7:5

That they may keep you from the forbidden woman,  
From the foreign woman who flatters with her words.

## Proverbs 7:6

For at the window of my house  
I looked out through my lattice,

## Proverbs 7:7

And I saw among the naive,  
And discerned among the youths  
> A young man lacking sense,

## Proverbs 7:8

Passing through the street near her corner,  
And he walks along the way to her house,

## Proverbs 7:9

In the twilight, in the evening,  
In the middle of the night and the darkness.

## Proverbs 7:10

And behold, a woman comes to meet him,  
Dressed as a prostitute and cunning of heart.

## Proverbs 7:11

She is boisterous and rebellious,  
Her feet do not remain at home;

## Proverbs 7:12

She is now in the streets, now in the public squares,  
> And lurks by every corner.

## Proverbs 7:13

So she seizes him and kisses him,  
And with a brazen face she says to him:

## Proverbs 7:14

“I was due to offer peace offerings;  
Today I have paid my vows.

## Proverbs 7:15

Therefore I have come out to meet you,  
To seek your presence earnestly, and I have found you.

## Proverbs 7:16

I have spread my couch with coverings,  
With coloured linens of Egypt.

## Proverbs 7:17

I have sprinkled my bed  
With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.

## Proverbs 7:18

Come, let us drink our fill of love until morning;  
Let us delight ourselves with caresses.

## Proverbs 7:19

For my husband is not at home,  
He has gone on a long journey;

## Proverbs 7:20

He has taken a bag of money with him,  
At the full moon he will come home.”

## Proverbs 7:21

With her many persuasions she entices him;  
With her flattering lips she seduces him.

## Proverbs 7:22

Suddenly he follows her,  
As an ox goes to the slaughter,  
> Or as one in fetters to the discipline of a fool,

## Proverbs 7:23

Until an arrow pierces his liver;  
> As a bird hurries to the snare,  
> He does not know it will cost him his life.

## Proverbs 7:24

Now therefore, my sons, listen to me,  
And pay attention to the words of my mouth.

## Proverbs 7:25

Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways,  
Do not stray into her paths.

## Proverbs 7:26

For many are the victims she has brought down,  
And numerous are all her slain.

## Proverbs 7:27

Her house is the way to Sheol,  
Descending to the chambers of death.
