# Proverbs Chapter 5

## Proverbs 5:1

My son, pay attention to my wisdom, and incline your ear to my understanding,

## Proverbs 5:2

so that you may maintain discretion, and your lips may preserve knowledge.

## Proverbs 5:3

For the lips of an adulterous woman drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil;

## Proverbs 5:4

but ultimately she is as bitter as wormwood, as sharp as a double-edged sword.

## Proverbs 5:5

Her feet descend to death, her steps lead straight to Sheol.

## Proverbs 5:6

She does not consider the path of life; her ways are unstable, and she does not know it.

## Proverbs 5:7

Therefore, my sons, listen to me and do not turn away from my words.

## Proverbs 5:8

Keep your path far from her, and do not approach the door of her house,

## Proverbs 5:9

lest you give your honour to others, and your years to the cruel one;

## Proverbs 5:10

lest strangers be filled with your wealth, and your hard-earned possessions go to the house of a foreigner;

## Proverbs 5:11

and in the end, you will groan when your flesh and body are spent,

## Proverbs 5:12

You will say, “How I hated discipline, and my heart rejected correction!

## Proverbs 5:13

I did not heed the voice of my teachers, nor did I listen to my instructors.

## Proverbs 5:14

I was almost in complete ruin in the midst of the assembly and congregation.”

## Proverbs 5:15

Drink water from your own cistern, and fresh water from your own well.

## Proverbs 5:16

Should your springs overflow into the streets, your streams of water in the public squares?

## Proverbs 5:17

Let them be yours alone, not to be shared with strangers.

## Proverbs 5:18

Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice in the wife of your youth.

## Proverbs 5:19

A loving doe, a graceful gazelle—may her breasts satisfy you always, may you be ever intoxicated with her love.

## Proverbs 5:20

Why, my son, should you be intoxicated with an adulteress, and embrace the bosom of a wayward woman?

---

## Proverbs 5:21

For the ways of everyone are before the eyes of the Lord, and He examines all their paths.

## Proverbs 5:22

The wrongdoings of the wicked will ensnare them, and they will be held fast by the cords of their sins.

## Proverbs 5:23

They will die for lack of discipline, and in the greatness of their folly they will go astray.
