# Proverbs Chapter 2

## Proverbs 2:1

My son, if you accept my words and treasure my commandments within you,

## Proverbs 2:2

Making your ear attentive to wisdom and inclining your heart to understanding—

## Proverbs 2:3

Indeed, if you cry out for insight and raise your voice for understanding,

## Proverbs 2:4

If you seek it as silver and search for it as for hidden treasure,

## Proverbs 2:5

Then you will understand the fear of the Lord and discover the knowledge of God.

## Proverbs 2:6

For the Lord gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding.

## Proverbs 2:7

He stores up sound wisdom for the upright; He is a shield to those whose walk is blameless,

## Proverbs 2:8

Guarding the paths of justice and watching over the way of His faithful ones.

---

## Proverbs 2:9

Then you will perceive what is right and just and fair—every good path.

## Proverbs 2:10

For wisdom will fill your heart, and knowledge will bring joy to your soul.

## Proverbs 2:11

Discretion will protect you, and understanding will watch over you.

---

## Proverbs 2:12

To save you from the ways of wicked men, from those who speak perverse things,

## Proverbs 2:13

From those who have left the paths of uprightness to walk in dark ways,

## Proverbs 2:14

Who delight in doing wrong and rejoice in the perversity of evil,

## Proverbs 2:15

Whose paths are crooked and who are devious in their ways.

---

## Proverbs 2:16

To save you from the adulterous woman, from the foreign woman who flatters with her words,

## Proverbs 2:17

Who leaves the partner of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God.

## Proverbs 2:18

For her house leads down to death, and her paths to the spirits of the dead.

## Proverbs 2:19

None who go to her return, nor do they attain the paths of life.

---

## Proverbs 2:20

So you will walk in the ways of good people and keep to the paths of the righteous.

## Proverbs 2:21

For the upright will live in the land, and the blameless will remain in it;

## Proverbs 2:22

But the wicked will be removed from the land, and the treacherous will be uprooted from it.
