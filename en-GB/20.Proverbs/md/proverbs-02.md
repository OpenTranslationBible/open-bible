# Proverbs Chapter 2

## Proverbs 2:1

My son, if you will receive my words  
And treasure my commandments within you,

## Proverbs 2:2

Make your ear attentive to wisdom,  
Incline your heart to understanding;

## Proverbs 2:3

For if you cry out for discernment,  
Raise your voice for understanding;

## Proverbs 2:4

If you seek her as silver  
And search for her as for hidden treasures;

## Proverbs 2:5

Then you will understand the fear of the Lord,  
And discover the knowledge of God.

## Proverbs 2:6

For the Lord gives wisdom;  
From His mouth come knowledge and understanding.

## Proverbs 2:7

He stores up sound wisdom for the upright;  
He is a shield to those who walk in integrity,

## Proverbs 2:8

Guarding the paths of justice,  
And He watches over the way of His faithful ones.

---

## Proverbs 2:9

Then you will discern righteousness, justice,  
And integrity and every good path.

## Proverbs 2:10

For wisdom will enter your heart,  
And knowledge will be pleasant to your soul;

## Proverbs 2:11

Discretion will watch over you,  
Understanding will guard you,

---

## Proverbs 2:12

To rescue you from the way of evil,  
From a person who speaks perverse things;

## Proverbs 2:13

From those who leave the paths of uprightness  
To walk in the ways of darkness;

## Proverbs 2:14

Who delight in doing evil  
And rejoice in the perversity of evil;

## Proverbs 2:15

Whose paths are crooked,  
And who are devious in their ways;

---

## Proverbs 2:16

To rescue you from the strange woman,  
From the foreign woman who flatters with her words,

## Proverbs 2:17

Who leaves the companion of her youth  
And forgets the covenant of her God;

## Proverbs 2:18

For her house sinks down to death,  
And her tracks lead to the dead;

## Proverbs 2:19

None who go to her return,  
Nor do they reach the paths of life.

---

## Proverbs 2:20

So you will walk in the way of good people  
And keep to the paths of the righteous.

## Proverbs 2:21

For the upright will live in the land,  
And the blameless will remain in it;

## Proverbs 2:22

But the wicked will be cut off from the land,  
And the treacherous will be uprooted from it.
