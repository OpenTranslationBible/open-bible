# Proverbs Chapter 27

## Proverbs 27:1

Do not boast about tomorrow,  
For you do not know what a day may bring.

## Proverbs 27:2

Let another praise you, and not your own mouth;  
A stranger, and not your own lips.

## Proverbs 27:3

A stone is heavy and the sand weighty,  
But the provocation of a fool is heavier than both of them.

## Proverbs 27:4

Wrath is fierce and anger is a flood,  
But who can stand before jealousy?

## Proverbs 27:5

Better is open rebuke  
Than love that is concealed.

## Proverbs 27:6

Faithful are the wounds of a friend,  
But deceitful are the kisses of an enemy.

## Proverbs 27:7

A satisfied person despises honey,  
But to a hungry person, any bitter thing is sweet.

## Proverbs 27:8

Like a bird that wanders from its nest,  
So is a person who wanders from his home.

## Proverbs 27:9

Oil and perfume make the heart glad,  
And the sweetness of a friend comes from his advice.

## Proverbs 27:10

Do not abandon your own friend or your father’s friend,  
And do not go to your brother’s house on the day of your disaster;  
Better is a neighbour who is near  
Than a brother far away.

One who blesses his friend with a loud voice early in the morning,  
It will be considered a curse to him.

A constant dripping on a day of steady rain  
And a contentious woman are alike;

And grasps oil with his right hand.

As in water a face reflects the face,

Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied,  
Nor are the eyes of man ever satisfied.

The crucible is for silver and the furnace for gold,  
And a person is tested by the praise accorded him.

Though you pound a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with crushed grain,  
His foolishness will not depart from him.

And pay attention to your herds;

For riches are not forever,  
Nor does a crown endure to all generations.

## Proverbs 27:25

When the grass disappears, the new growth is seen,  
And the herbs of the mountains are gathered in,

## Proverbs 27:26

The lambs will be for your clothing,  
And the goats will bring the price of a field,

## Proverbs 27:27

And there will be enough goats’ milk for your food,  
For the food of your household,  
And sustenance for your attendants.
