# Proverbs Chapter 8

## Proverbs 8:1

Does wisdom not call,  
And understanding raise her voice?

## Proverbs 8:2

On top of the heights beside the way,  
Where the paths meet, she takes her stand;

## Proverbs 8:3

Beside the gates, at the opening to the city,  
At the entrance of the doors, she cries out:

## Proverbs 8:4

â€œTo you, people, I call,  
And my voice is to mankind.

## Proverbs 8:5

You naive ones, understand prudence;  
And you fools, understand wisdom.

## Proverbs 8:6

Listen, for I will speak noble things;  
And the opening of my lips will reveal right things.

## Proverbs 8:7

For my mouth will utter truth;  
And wickedness is an abomination to my lips.

## Proverbs 8:8

All the words of my mouth are in righteousness;  
There is nothing crooked or perverted in them.

## Proverbs 8:9

They are all straightforward to him who understands,  
And right to those who find knowledge.

## Proverbs 8:10

Accept my instruction and not silver,  
And knowledge rather than choice gold.

## Proverbs 8:11

For wisdom is better than jewels,  
And all desirable things cannot compare with her.

## Proverbs 8:12

I, wisdom, dwell with prudence,  
And I find knowledge and discretion.

## Proverbs 8:13

The fear of the Lord is to hate evil;  
Pride, arrogance, the evil way,  
> And the perverted mouth, I hate.

## Proverbs 8:14

Advice is mine and sound wisdom;  
I am understanding, power is mine.

## Proverbs 8:15

By me kings reign,  
And rulers decree justice.

## Proverbs 8:16

By me princes rule, and nobles,  
All who judge rightly.

## Proverbs 8:17

I love those who love me,  
And those who diligently seek me will find me.

## Proverbs 8:18

Riches and honour are with me,  
Enduring wealth and righteousness.

## Proverbs 8:19

My fruit is better than gold, even pure gold,  
And my yield better than choice silver.

## Proverbs 8:20

I walk in the way of righteousness,  
In the midst of the paths of justice,

## Proverbs 8:21

To give those who love me wealth,  
That I may fill their treasuries.

## Proverbs 8:22

The Lord created me at the beginning of His way,  
Before His works of old.

## Proverbs 8:23

From eternity I was established,  
From the beginning, from the earliest times of the earth.

## Proverbs 8:24

When there were no ocean depths, I was born,  
When there were no springs abounding with water.

## Proverbs 8:25

Before the mountains were settled,  
Before the hills, I was born;

## Proverbs 8:26

While He had not yet made the earth and the fields,  
Nor the first dust of the world.

## Proverbs 8:27

When He established the heavens, I was there;  
When He inscribed a circle on the face of the deep,

## Proverbs 8:28

When He made firm the skies above,  
When the springs of the deep became fixed,

## Proverbs 8:29

When He set a boundary for the sea  
So that the water would not violate His command,  
> When He marked out the foundations of the earth,

## Proverbs 8:30

Then I was beside Him, as a master workman;  
And I was His delight daily,  
> Rejoicing always before Him,

## Proverbs 8:31

> Rejoicing in the world, His earth,  
> And having my delight in the sons of mankind.

## Proverbs 8:32

Now then, sons, listen to me,  
For blessed are those who keep my ways.

## Proverbs 8:33

Listen to instruction and be wise,  
And do not neglect it.

## Proverbs 8:34

Blessed is the person who listens to me,  
Watching daily at my gates,  
> Waiting at my doorposts.

## Proverbs 8:35

For the one who finds me finds life  
And obtains favour from the Lord.

## Proverbs 8:36

But the one who sins against me injures himself;  
All those who hate me love death.
