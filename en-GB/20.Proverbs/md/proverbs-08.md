# Proverbs Chapter 8

## Proverbs 8:1

Does not wisdom call out, and understanding raise her voice?

## Proverbs 8:2

On the heights along the way, where the paths meet, she takes her stand;

## Proverbs 8:3

Beside the gates leading into the city, at the entrance, she cries out:

## Proverbs 8:4

“To you, O people, I call, and my voice is to all mankind.

## Proverbs 8:5

You who are simple, gain prudence; you who are foolish, understand wisdom.

## Proverbs 8:6

Listen, for I speak of noble things; the opening of my lips will reveal what is right.

## Proverbs 8:7

My mouth speaks truth; wickedness is an abomination to my lips.

## Proverbs 8:8

All the words of my mouth are righteous; there is nothing crooked or perverse in them.

## Proverbs 8:9

To the discerning, they are all straightforward; to those who find knowledge, they are right.

## Proverbs 8:10

Accept my instruction instead of silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold.

## Proverbs 8:11

For wisdom is more valuable than rubies, and nothing you desire can equal her.

## Proverbs 8:12

“I, wisdom, live with prudence, and I possess knowledge and discretion.

## Proverbs 8:13

To fear the Lord is to hate evil; I hate pride, arrogance, the evil way,

> and perverse speech.

## Proverbs 8:14

Sound advice is mine and true wisdom; I am understanding, strength is mine.

## Proverbs 8:15

By me kings reign, and rulers decree what is just;

## Proverbs 8:16

by me princes govern, and nobles—all who judge rightly.

## Proverbs 8:17

I cherish those who love me, and those who earnestly seek me will find me.

## Proverbs 8:18

With me are riches and honour, enduring wealth and righteousness.

## Proverbs 8:19

My fruit is better than gold, even pure gold; what I yield surpasses choice silver.

## Proverbs 8:20

I follow the path of righteousness, in the midst of the ways of justice,

## Proverbs 8:21

bestowing wealth on those who love me, and filling their treasuries.

## Proverbs 8:22

“The Lord created me as the first of His works, before His deeds of old.

## Proverbs 8:23

From eternity I was established, from the beginning, when the world came to be.

## Proverbs 8:24

Before the ocean depths existed, I was brought forth, before there were springs overflowing with water;

## Proverbs 8:25

before the mountains were settled, before the hills, I was brought forth;

## Proverbs 8:26

before He made the earth or its fields or any of the dust of the world.

## Proverbs 8:27

I was there when He set the heavens in place, when He inscribed a circle on the face of the deep,

## Proverbs 8:28

when He made firm the skies above and fixed securely the fountains of the deep,

## Proverbs 8:29

when He set a boundary for the sea so that the waters would not overstep His command,

> and when He marked out the foundations of the earth.

## Proverbs 8:30

Then I was beside Him, as a master craftsman; I was His delight day after day,

> rejoicing always in His presence,

## Proverbs 8:31

> rejoicing in His whole world
> and delighting in mankind.

## Proverbs 8:32

“So now, my children, listen to me; blessed are those who follow my ways.

## Proverbs 8:33

Listen to my instruction and be wise; do not neglect it.

## Proverbs 8:34

Fortunate is the person who listens to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at my doorposts.

## Proverbs 8:35

For whoever finds me discovers life and receives favour from the Lord.

## Proverbs 8:36

But whoever fails to find me harms themselves; all who hate me love death.”
