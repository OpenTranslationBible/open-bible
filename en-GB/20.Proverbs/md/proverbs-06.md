# Proverbs Chapter 6

## Proverbs 6:1

My son, if you have become a guarantor for your neighbour,  
Have given a handshake for a stranger,

## Proverbs 6:2

You have been ensnared by the words of your mouth,  
Have been caught by the words of your mouth.

## Proverbs 6:3

Do this then, my son, and save yourself:  
Since you have come into the hand of your neighbour,  
> Go, humble yourself, and plead with your neighbour.

## Proverbs 6:4

Do not give sleep to your eyes  
Or slumber to your eyelids;

## Proverbs 6:5

Save yourself like a gazelle from the hunter’s hand,  
> And like a bird from the hand of the fowler.

---

## Proverbs 6:6

Go to the ant, you lazy one,  
Observe its ways and be wise,

## Proverbs 6:7

Which, having no chief, officer, or ruler,

## Proverbs 6:8

Prepares its food in the summer  
And gathers its provision in the harvest.

## Proverbs 6:9

How long will you lie down, you lazy one?  
When will you arise from your sleep?

## Proverbs 6:10

“A little sleep, a little slumber,  
> A little folding of the hands to rest”—

## Proverbs 6:11

Then your poverty will come in like a drifter,  
And your need like an armed man.

---

## Proverbs 6:12

A worthless person, a wicked man,  
Is one who walks with a perverse mouth,

## Proverbs 6:13

Who winks with his eyes, signals with his feet,  
Points with his fingers;

## Proverbs 6:14

Who with perversity in his heart continually devises evil,  
> Who spreads strife.

## Proverbs 6:15

Therefore his disaster will come suddenly;  
Instantly he will be broken and there will be no healing.

---

## Proverbs 6:16

There are six things that the Lord hates,  
Yes, seven that are an abomination to Him:

## Proverbs 6:17

> Haughty eyes, a lying tongue,  
> And hands that shed innocent blood,

## Proverbs 6:18

> A heart that devises wicked plans,  
> Feet that run rapidly to evil,

## Proverbs 6:19

> A false witness who declares lies,  
> And one who spreads strife among brothers.

## Proverbs 6:20

My son, comply with the commandment of your father,  
And do not ignore the teaching of your mother;

## Proverbs 6:21

Bind them continually on your heart;  
Tie them around your neck.

## Proverbs 6:22

When you walk, they will guide you;  
When you sleep, they will watch over you;  
> And when you awake, they will speak to you.

## Proverbs 6:23

For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching is light;  
And rebukes for discipline are the way of life

## Proverbs 6:24

To keep you from the evil woman,  
From the smooth tongue of the foreign woman.

## Proverbs 6:25

Do not desire her beauty in your heart,  
And do not let her capture you with her eyelids.

---

## Proverbs 6:26

For by a prostitute one is reduced to a loaf of bread,  
And the adulteress hunts for a precious life.

## Proverbs 6:27

Can anyone take fire in his lap  
And his clothes not be burned?

## Proverbs 6:28

Or can anyone walk on hot coals  
And his feet not be scorched?

## Proverbs 6:29

So is the one who goes in to his neighbour’s wife;  
Whoever touches her will not go unpunished.

---

## Proverbs 6:30

People do not despise a thief if he steals  
To satisfy himself when he is hungry;

## Proverbs 6:31

But when he is found, he must repay sevenfold;  
He must give all the substance of his house.

## Proverbs 6:32

One who commits adultery with a woman is lacking sense;  
He who does it destroys his own soul.

## Proverbs 6:33

He will suffer wounds and disgrace,  
And his shame will not be wiped away.

---

## Proverbs 6:34

For jealousy enrages a man,  
And he will not spare on the day of vengeance.

## Proverbs 6:35

He will not accept any compensation,  
Nor be willing, even if you give a large gift.
