# Proverbs Chapter 6

## Proverbs 6:1

My son, if you have become a guarantor for your neighbour, or have given a handshake for a stranger,

## Proverbs 6:2

you have been ensnared by the words of your mouth, caught by what you have spoken.

## Proverbs 6:3

So do this, my son, to save yourself, since you have fallen into your neighbour's hands:

> Go, humble yourself, and be urgent with your neighbour to free yourself.

## Proverbs 6:4

Do not allow sleep to your eyes, nor slumber to your eyelids;

## Proverbs 6:5

Save yourself like a gazelle from the hunter's hand,

> and like a bird from the snare of the fowler.

## Proverbs 6:6

Consider the ant, you lazy one; watch its ways and gain wisdom!

## Proverbs 6:7

It has no chief, officer, or ruler,

## Proverbs 6:8

yet it prepares its food in the summer and gathers its provision at harvest.

## Proverbs 6:9

How long will you lie there, you lazy one? When will you arise from your sleep?

## Proverbs 6:10

A little sleep, a little slumber,

> a little folding of the hands to rest—

## Proverbs 6:11

and poverty will come upon you like a drifter, and scarcity like an armed man.

---

## Proverbs 6:12

A worthless and wicked person, who walks with a corrupt mouth,

## Proverbs 6:13

who winks with his eyes, signals with his feet, and points with his fingers,

## Proverbs 6:14

who plots evil with deceit in his heart—

> he continually spreads strife.

## Proverbs 6:15

Therefore disaster will overtake him suddenly; instantly he will be broken without remedy.

## Proverbs 6:16

There are six things the Lord hates, seven that are an abomination to Him:

## Proverbs 6:17

> haughty eyes, a lying tongue,
> and hands that shed innocent blood,

## Proverbs 6:18

> a heart that devises wicked schemes,
> feet that are quick to rush into evil,

## Proverbs 6:19

> a false witness who pours out lies,
> and one who spreads strife among brothers.

## Proverbs 6:20

My son, keep your father's commandment, and do not forsake your mother's teaching.

## Proverbs 6:21

Bind them continually on your heart; fasten them around your neck.

## Proverbs 6:22

When you walk, they will guide you; when you sleep, they will watch over you;

> and when you awake, they will speak to you.

## Proverbs 6:23

For the commandment is a lamp, the teaching is a light, and corrections for discipline are the way to life,

## Proverbs 6:24

to keep you from the evil woman, from the smooth tongue of the wayward woman.

## Proverbs 6:25

Do not desire her beauty in your heart, nor let her captivate you with her eyes.

## Proverbs 6:26

For a prostitute can be had for a loaf of bread, but an adulteress hunts for a precious life.

## Proverbs 6:27

Can a man take fire into his lap without his clothes being burned?

## Proverbs 6:28

Or can one walk on hot coals without his feet being scorched?

## Proverbs 6:29

So is the one who goes in to his neighbour's wife; whoever touches her will not go unpunished.

---

## Proverbs 6:30

A thief is not despised if he steals to satisfy his hunger when he is starving;

## Proverbs 6:31

yet if he is caught, he must repay sevenfold, even if it costs him all the wealth of his house.

## Proverbs 6:32

But one who commits adultery with a woman lacks sense; he who does so destroys himself.

## Proverbs 6:33

He will face wounds and disgrace, and his shame will never be wiped away.

---

## Proverbs 6:34

For jealousy enrages a man, and he will show no mercy on the day of vengeance.

## Proverbs 6:35

He will not accept any compensation; no matter how great the bribe, he will refuse it.
