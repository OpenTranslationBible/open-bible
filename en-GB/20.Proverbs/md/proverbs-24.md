I passed by the field of a sluggard, by the vineyard of someone lacking sense;

## Proverbs 24:31

and it was overgrown with thorns, the ground was covered with weeds, and the stone wall was in ruins.

## Proverbs 24:33

A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest—

## Proverbs 24:34

and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and scarcity like an armed man.
