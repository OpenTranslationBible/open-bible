## Proverbs 24:12

If you say, “See, we did not know this,”  
Does He not consider it who weighs the hearts?  
And does He not know it who watches over your soul?  
And will He not repay a person according to his work?

My son, eat honey, for it is good,  
Yes, the honey from the comb is sweet to your taste;

If you find it, then there will be a future,  
And your hope will not be cut off.

Do not lie in wait, you wicked person, against the home of the righteous;

For a righteous person falls seven times and rises again,  
But the wicked stumble in time of disaster.

The lamp of the wicked will be put out.

My son, fear the Lord and the king;  
Do not get involved with those of differing opinions;

## Proverbs 24:22

For their disaster will rise suddenly,  
And who knows the ruin that can come from both of them?

## Proverbs 24:23

These also are sayings of the wise:  
To show partiality in judgment is not good.

## Proverbs 24:24

One who says to the wicked, “You are righteous,”  
Peoples will curse him, nations will scorn him;

## Proverbs 24:25

But for those who rebuke the wicked there will be delight,  
And a good blessing will come upon them.

## Proverbs 24:26

He kisses the lips  
Who gives a right answer.

## Proverbs 24:27

Prepare your work outside,  
And make it ready for yourself in the field;  
Afterwards, then build your house.

## Proverbs 24:28

Do not be a witness against your neighbour for no reason,  
And do not deceive with your lips.

Do not say, “I shall do to him just as he has done to me;  
I will repay the person according to his work.”

## Proverbs 24:30

I passed by the field of a lazy one,  
And by the vineyard of a person lacking sense,

## Proverbs 24:31

And behold, it was completely overgrown with weeds;  
Its surface was covered with nettles,  
And its stone wall was broken down.

## Proverbs 24:32

When I saw, I reflected upon it;  
I looked, and received instruction:

## Proverbs 24:33

“A little sleep, a little slumber,  
A little folding of the hands to rest,”

## Proverbs 24:34

Then your poverty will come like a drifter,  
And your need like an armed man.
