# Proverbs Chapter 1

## Proverbs 1:1

The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:

## Proverbs 1:2

To gain wisdom and instruction, to discern words of understanding;

## Proverbs 1:3

To receive instruction in wise conduct, in righteousness, justice, and fairness;

## Proverbs 1:4

To impart prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the young;

## Proverbs 1:5

Let the wise hear and increase their learning, and let those of understanding acquire guidance,

## Proverbs 1:6

To comprehend proverbs and parables, the sayings and enigmas of the wise.

## Proverbs 1:7

The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction.

## Proverbs 1:8

Listen, my son, to your father’s instruction, and do not forsake your mother’s teaching;

## Proverbs 1:9

For they are a graceful garland for your head and pendants for your neck.

## Proverbs 1:10

My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent.

## Proverbs 1:11

If they say, “Come with us,

> let us lie in wait for blood,
> let us ambush the innocent without reason;

## Proverbs 1:12

Let us swallow them alive like the grave,

> and whole, like those who go down to the pit;

## Proverbs 1:13

We shall find all kinds of precious goods,

> we shall fill our houses with plunder;

## Proverbs 1:14

Throw in your lot with us,

> we shall all share one purse”—

## Proverbs 1:15

My son, do not walk in their way, keep your foot from their path,

## Proverbs 1:16

For their feet run to evil,
and they are quick to shed blood.

## Proverbs 1:17

How futile it is to spread a net in full view of all the birds!

## Proverbs 1:18

But these men lie in wait for their own blood; they set an ambush for their own lives.

## Proverbs 1:19

Such are the ways of everyone who is greedy for unjust gain; it takes away the life of its possessors.

## Proverbs 1:20

Wisdom calls aloud in the street,
she raises her voice in the public squares;

## Proverbs 1:21

At the head of the bustling streets she cries out,
at the entrance of the city gates she makes her speech:

## Proverbs 1:22

“How long, you simple ones, will you love your simple ways?

> How long will scoffers delight in scoffing
> and fools hate knowledge?

## Proverbs 1:23

Repent at my rebuke!

> Then I will pour out my spirit upon you,
> I will make my words known to you.

## Proverbs 1:24

Because I have called and you refused, I have stretched out my hand and no one heeded;

## Proverbs 1:25

Since you ignored all my advice
and would not accept my rebuke,

## Proverbs 1:26

I will also laugh at your calamity;
I will mock when your dread comes,

---

## Proverbs 1:27

When your dread comes like a storm and your calamity like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you.

## Proverbs 1:28

Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer; they will seek me diligently but will not find me,

## Proverbs 1:29

Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the Lord.

## Proverbs 1:30

They would not accept my advice and spurned all my rebuke.

## Proverbs 1:31

Therefore they shall eat the fruit of their ways and be filled with the fruit of their schemes.

## Proverbs 1:32

For the waywardness of the simple will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them;

## Proverbs 1:33

But whoever listens to me will dwell securely and will be at ease, without fear of harm.”
