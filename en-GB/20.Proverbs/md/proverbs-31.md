# Proverbs Chapter 31

## Proverbs 31:1

The sayings of King Lemuel, an inspired message his mother imparted to him:

## Proverbs 31:2

What, my son? What, son of my womb? What, son of my vows?

## Proverbs 31:3

Do not give your strength to women, nor your ways to those who ruin kings.

## Proverbs 31:4

It is not for kings, Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine, nor for rulers to crave strong drink,

## Proverbs 31:5

lest they drink and forget what has been decreed, and pervert the rights of all the oppressed.

## Proverbs 31:6

Let strong drink be given to those who are perishing, and wine to those in bitter distress.

## Proverbs 31:7

Let them drink and forget their poverty, and remember their trouble no more.
