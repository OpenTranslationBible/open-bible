# Proverbs Chapter 30

## Proverbs 30:1

The sayings of Agur, son of Jakeh, the pronouncement. This man declares to Ithiel, to Ithiel and Ucal: “I am weary, God, but I can prevail.

## Proverbs 30:2

Surely I am more ignorant than any other, and I lack human understanding.

## Proverbs 30:3

I have not acquired wisdom, nor do I possess the knowledge of the Holy One.

## Proverbs 30:4

Who has ascended to heaven and descended? Who has gathered the wind in his hands? Who has wrapped the waters in a garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is his name, and what is his son’s name? Surely you know!

## Proverbs 30:5

Every word of God is flawless; he is a shield to those who seek refuge in him.

## Proverbs 30:6

Do not add to his words, or he will rebuke you and you will be found a liar.

## Proverbs 30:7

Two things I ask of you, Lord; do not deny me before I die:

## Proverbs 30:8

Keep falsehood and deceit far from me; give me neither poverty nor wealth, but provide me with my allotted portion.

## Proverbs 30:9

Otherwise, I may have too much and deny you and say, ‘Who is the Lord?’ Or I may become impoverished and steal, and so dishonour the name of my God.

## Proverbs 30:10

Do not slander a servant to their master, or they will curse you, and you will be found guilty.

## Proverbs 30:11

There are those who curse their fathers and do not bless their mothers;

## Proverbs 30:12

those who consider themselves pure but have not been cleansed from their wrongdoing;

## Proverbs 30:13

those whose eyes are ever so haughty, whose glances are filled with arrogance;

## Proverbs 30:14

those whose teeth are like swords and whose jaws are set with knives to devour the poor from the earth and the needy from among humanity.

## Proverbs 30:15

The leech has two daughters, crying out, ‘Give! Give!’ There are three things that are never satisfied, four that never say, ‘Enough!’:

## Proverbs 30:16

the grave, the barren womb, the earth that is never satisfied with water, and fire that never says, ‘Enough!’

## Proverbs 30:17

The eye that mocks a father and scorns an aged mother will be pecked out by the ravens of the valley, and eaten by the vultures.

---

## Proverbs 30:18

There are three things that are too wonderful for me, four that I do not understand:

## Proverbs 30:19

the flight of an eagle in the sky, the movement of a snake on a rock, the course of a ship on the high seas, and the way of a man with a young woman.

## Proverbs 30:20

Such is the behaviour of an unfaithful woman: she eats the food, and then cleans her mouth so she can state: ‘I have done nothing wrong.’

## Proverbs 30:21

Under three things the earth trembles, under four it cannot endure:

## Proverbs 30:22

a servant who becomes king, a fool who is satisfied with food,

## Proverbs 30:23

an unloved woman who gets married, and a servant who displaces her mistress.

---

## Proverbs 30:24

Four small creatures on earth are exceedingly wise:

## Proverbs 30:25

Ants, though small and weak, store up their food in the summer;

## Proverbs 30:26

Hyraxes, though not powerful, make their home in the crags;

## Proverbs 30:27

Locusts, having no king, advance together in ranks;

## Proverbs 30:28

A lizard, easily caught by hand, yet found in kings’ palaces.

---

## Proverbs 30:29

There are three things that are stately in their stride, four that move with noble bearing:

## Proverbs 30:30

A lion, majestic among creatures, who retreats from nothing;

## Proverbs 30:31

A proud rooster, a he-goat, and a king secure against revolt.

---

## Proverbs 30:32

If you have been foolish in exalting yourself, or if you have devised evil, put your hand over your mouth.

## Proverbs 30:33

For as the churning of milk produces butter, and as twisting the nose produces blood, so stirring up anger produces strife.
