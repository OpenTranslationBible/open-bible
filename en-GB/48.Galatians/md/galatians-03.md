# Galatians Chapter 3

## Galatians 3:1
You senseless Galatians! Who has cast a spell on you? Before your eyes, Jesus Christ was vividly depicted as crucified.

## Galatians 3:2
I would like to ask you only this: Did you receive the Spirit by observing the law, or by hearing with faith?

## Galatians 3:3
Are you so senseless? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now seeking completion by the flesh?

## Galatians 3:4
Have you undergone so much for nothing—if indeed it was for nothing?

## Galatians 3:5
So then, does He who supplies you with the Spirit and performs miracles among you do so by the works of the law, or by hearing with faith?

## Galatians 3:6
Just as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness.

## Galatians 3:7
Therefore, understand that those who are of faith are the children of Abraham.

## Galatians 3:8
Scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, and proclaimed the gospel beforehand to Abraham: “All nations will be blessed through you.”

## Galatians 3:9
So then, those who have faith are blessed along with Abraham, who was a man of faith.

## Galatians 3:10
For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse, as it is written: “Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all things written in the Book of the Law, to do them.”

## Galatians 3:11
It is evident that no one is justified before God by the law, for “the righteous will live by faith.”

## Galatians 3:12
The law is not of faith; rather, “The one who does them will live by them.”

## Galatians 3:13
Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree.”

## Galatians 3:14
He redeemed us so that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, so that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.

## Galatians 3:15
Brothers and sisters, I speak in human terms: even a human covenant, once ratified, cannot be set aside or added to.

## Galatians 3:16
The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. Scripture does not say “and to seeds,” meaning many, but “and to your seed,” meaning one, who is Christ.

## Galatians 3:17
What I am saying is this: the law, which came 430 years later, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to nullify the promise.

## Galatians 3:18
For if the inheritance is based on the law, it is no longer based on a promise; but God granted it to Abraham through a promise.

## Galatians 3:19
Why then was the law given? It was added because of transgressions, until the Seed to whom the promise was made would come, having been ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.

## Galatians 3:20
Now a mediator implies more than one party, but God is one.

## Galatians 3:21
Is the law then contrary to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would indeed be based on law.

## Galatians 3:22
But Scripture has confined everything under sin, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.

## Galatians 3:23
Before this faith came, we were held in custody under the law, locked up until the faith that was to come would be revealed.

## Galatians 3:24
Thus the law was our guardian until Christ came, that we might be justified by faith.

## Galatians 3:25
But now that faith has arrived, we are no longer under a guardian.

## Galatians 3:26
For through faith, you are all children of God in Christ Jesus.

## Galatians 3:27
For all of you who were baptised into Christ have embraced Christ.

## Galatians 3:28
There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.

## Galatians 3:29
And if you are in Christ, then you are Abraham’s seed, heirs according to the promise.
