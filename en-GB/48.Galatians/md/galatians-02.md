# Galatians Chapter 2

## Galatians 2:1

After fourteen years, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along as well.

## Galatians 2:2

I went up because of a revelation, and I presented to those of high reputation the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles, doing so privately, to ensure that I was not running or had not run in vain.

## Galatians 2:3

Yet not even Titus, who was with me and is a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.

## Galatians 2:4

This issue arose due to false brothers who had infiltrated our group to spy on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus, intending to bring us into bondage.

## Galatians 2:5

We did not yield to them for even a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might remain with you.

## Galatians 2:6

Regarding those of high esteem—whatever they were makes no difference to me; God does not show partiality—they added nothing to my message.

## Galatians 2:7

Instead, they recognised that I had been given the responsibility of sharing the gospel with the uncircumcised, just as Peter was with the circumcised.

## Galatians 2:8

For the same God who worked through Peter as an apostle to the circumcised was also at work in me for the Gentiles.

## Galatians 2:9

Recognising the grace given to me, James, Cephas, and John, esteemed as pillars, extended the right hand of fellowship to me and Barnabas, agreeing that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised.

## Galatians 2:10

They only asked us to remember the poor, which was the very thing I was eager to do.

## Galatians 2:11

But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face because he stood condemned.

## Galatians 2:12

Before certain men came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles. But when they arrived, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those from the circumcision group.

## Galatians 2:13

The other Jews joined him in this hypocrisy, so much so that even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy.

## Galatians 2:14

When I saw they were not acting in accordance with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in front of them all, “If you, a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you compel Gentiles to follow Jewish customs?”

## Galatians 2:15

“We are Jews by birth and not sinful Gentiles;

## Galatians 2:16

yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law, but through faith in Jesus Christ. So we also have believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified.

## Galatians 2:17

But if, while seeking to be justified in Christ, we ourselves are found to be sinners, is Christ then a promoter of sin? Certainly not!

## Galatians 2:18

If I rebuild what I have destroyed, I prove myself to be a transgressor.

## Galatians 2:19

For by the law, I have died to the law, so that I might live for God.

## Galatians 2:20

I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.

## Galatians 2:21

I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness could be gained through the law, then Christ died for no purpose.
