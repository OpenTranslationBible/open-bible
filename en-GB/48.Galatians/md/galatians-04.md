# Galatians Chapter 4

## Galatians 4:1

Now I say that as long as the heir is a child, he is no different from a slave, even though he is the owner of everything.

## Galatians 4:2

He is under guardians and trustees until the time appointed by his father.

## Galatians 4:3

In the same way, we also, when we were children, were in bondage under the basic principles of the world.

## Galatians 4:4

But when the time had fully come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the law,

## Galatians 4:5

to redeem those under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons and daughters.

## Galatians 4:6

Because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, “Abba, Father!”

## Galatians 4:7

Therefore, you are no longer a slave, but a child; and if a child, then an heir through God.

## Galatians 4:8

Formerly, when you did not know God, you were enslaved to those who by nature are not gods.

## Galatians 4:9

But now that you know God, or rather are known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and worthless principles? Do you wish to be enslaved by them once more?

## Galatians 4:10

You are observing special days and months and seasons and years.

## Galatians 4:11

I am afraid for you, that perhaps I have laboured over you in vain.

## Galatians 4:12

I entreat you, brothers and sisters, become like me, for I became like you. You have done me no wrong.

## Galatians 4:13

You know that it was due to an illness that I first preached the gospel to you.

## Galatians 4:14

Even though my condition was a trial to you, you did not despise or reject me, but you received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus himself.

## Galatians 4:15

Where then is your sense of blessing? I testify that, if you could have done so, you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.

## Galatians 4:16

Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth?

## Galatians 4:17

They are zealous to win you over, but not for good. They want to isolate you, so that you may be zealous for them.

## Galatians 4:18

It is good to be zealous, provided the purpose is good, and to be so always, not just when I am with you.

## Galatians 4:19

My beloved children, for whom I am again in the pains of childbirth until Christ is formed in you,

## Galatians 4:20

how I wish I could be present with you now and change my tone, for I am perplexed about you.

## Galatians 4:21

Tell me, you who want to be under the law, do you not hear the law?

## Galatians 4:22

For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the servant woman and one by the free woman.

## Galatians 4:23

The son of the servant woman was born according to the flesh, but the son of the free woman was born through the promise.

## Galatians 4:24

These things are an allegory: the women represent two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery; she is Hagar.

## Galatians 4:25

Now Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children.

## Galatians 4:26

But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother.

## Galatians 4:27

For it is written:

> “Rejoice, barren woman, you who do not bear;
> break forth and shout, you who are not in labour;
> for more are the children of the desolate
> than of her who has a husband.”

## Galatians 4:28

Now you, brothers and sisters, like Isaac, are children of the promise.

## Galatians 4:29

But just as then, the child born according to the flesh persecuted the one born according to the Spirit, so it is now.

## Galatians 4:30

But what does the Scripture say? “Cast out the servant woman and her son, for the son of the servant woman shall not share the inheritance with the son of the free woman.”

## Galatians 4:31

So then, brothers and sisters, we are not children of the servant woman, but of the free woman.
