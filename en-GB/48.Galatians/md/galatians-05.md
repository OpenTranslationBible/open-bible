# Galatians Chapter 5

## Galatians 5:1
It is for freedom that Christ has set us free; therefore, stand firm and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.

## Galatians 5:2
Listen! I, Paul, say to you that if you choose to be circumcised, Christ will be of no advantage to you.

## Galatians 5:3
And I repeat to every man who allows himself to be circumcised that he is required to keep the whole law.

## Galatians 5:4
You who are seeking to be justified by the law have been cut off from Christ; you have fallen from grace.

## Galatians 5:5
For through the Spirit, by faith, we eagerly await the hope of righteousness.

## Galatians 5:6
In Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any significance. What matters is faith expressing itself through love.

## Galatians 5:7
You were running well. Who prevented you from obeying the truth?

## Galatians 5:8
This influence does not come from the one who calls you.

## Galatians 5:9
A small amount of yeast affects the whole batch of dough.

## Galatians 5:10
I have confidence in the Lord that you will not adopt any other view. But the one who is causing you confusion will bear the penalty, whoever he is.

## Galatians 5:11
Brothers and sisters, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case, the offence of the cross has been removed.

## Galatians 5:12
I wish those who are unsettling you would even go so far as to emasculate themselves!

## Galatians 5:13
You, my brothers and sisters, were called to be free. However, do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh; instead, serve one another in love.

## Galatians 5:14
For the entire law is fulfilled in one command: “Love your neighbour as yourself.”

## Galatians 5:15
If you bite and devour one another, watch out that you are not consumed by one another.

## Galatians 5:16
So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not fulfil the desires of the flesh.

## Galatians 5:17
For the flesh desires what is against the Spirit, and the Spirit what is against the flesh; they are in opposition to each other, so that you are not to do whatever you wish.

## Galatians 5:18
But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.

## Galatians 5:19
The deeds of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, and debauchery;

## Galatians 5:20
idolatry, witchcraft, enmities, strife, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions,

## Galatians 5:21
envy, drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I have before, that those who engage in such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.

## Galatians 5:22
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,

## Galatians 5:23
gentleness, and self-control. There is no law against such things.

## Galatians 5:24
Those who belong to Christ Jesus have put to death the flesh with its passions and desires.

## Galatians 5:25
Since we live by the Spirit, let us also keep in step with the Spirit.

## Galatians 5:26
Let us not become conceited, provoking and envying one another.
