# Galatians Chapter 6

## Galatians 6:1

Brothers and sisters, even if a person is caught in any wrongdoing, you who are spiritual are to restore such a person in a spirit of gentleness; each one looking to yourself, so that you are not tempted as well.

## Galatians 6:2

Bear one another’s burdens, and thereby fulfill the law of Christ.

## Galatians 6:3

For if anyone thinks that he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.

## Galatians 6:4

But each one must examine his own work, and then he will have reason for boasting, but to himself alone, and not to another.

## Galatians 6:5

For each one will bear his own load.

## Galatians 6:6

The one who is taught the word is to share all good things with the one who teaches him.

## Galatians 6:7

Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a person sows, this he will also reap.

## Galatians 6:8

For the one who sows to his own flesh will reap destruction from the flesh, but the one who sows to the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit.

## Galatians 6:9

Let’s not become discouraged in doing good, for in due time we will reap, if we do not become weary.

## Galatians 6:10

So then, while we have opportunity, let’s do good to all people, and especially to those who are of the household of the faith.

## Galatians 6:11

See with what large letters I have written to you with my own hand!

## Galatians 6:12

All who want to make a good showing in the flesh try to compel you to be circumcised, simply so that they will not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.

## Galatians 6:13

For those who are circumcised do not even keep the Law themselves, but they want to have you circumcised so that they may boast in your flesh.

## Galatians 6:14

But far be it from me to boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.

## Galatians 6:15

For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.

## Galatians 6:16

And all who will follow this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.

## Galatians 6:17

From now on let no one cause trouble for me, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus.

## Galatians 6:18

The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers and sisters. Amen.
