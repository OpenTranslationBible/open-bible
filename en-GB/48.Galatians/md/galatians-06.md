# Galatians Chapter 6

## Galatians 6:1
Brothers and sisters, if anyone is caught in any wrongdoing, you who are guided by the Spirit should restore that person with a spirit of gentleness. But be careful, lest you too be tempted.

## Galatians 6:2
Help carry each otherâ€™s burdens, and in doing so, you will fulfill the law of Christ.

## Galatians 6:3
If anyone thinks they are something when they are nothing, they are deceiving themselves.

## Galatians 6:4
Each person should examine their own actions, and then they can take pride in themselves alone, without comparing themselves to others.

## Galatians 6:5
For each one must carry their own load.

## Galatians 6:6
The one who receives instruction in the word should share all good things with their instructor.

## Galatians 6:7
Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a person sows, that they will also reap.

## Galatians 6:8
For the one who sows to please their own flesh will reap destruction from the flesh, but the one who sows to please the Spirit will reap eternal life from the Spirit.

## Galatians 6:9
Let us not grow weary in doing good, for at the right time, we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.

## Galatians 6:10
Therefore, as we have the opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the household of faith.

## Galatians 6:11
Notice the large letters I use as I write to you with my own hand!

## Galatians 6:12
Those who want to make a good impression in the flesh are trying to compel you to be circumcised, only to avoid persecution for the cross of Christ.

## Galatians 6:13
For even those who are circumcised do not keep the law themselves, yet they want you to be circumcised so they can boast about your flesh.

## Galatians 6:14
However, I will never take pride in anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.

## Galatians 6:15
For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything; what matters is a new creation.

## Galatians 6:16
Peace and mercy to all who follow this rule, and upon the Israel of God.

## Galatians 6:17
Henceforth, let no one trouble me, for I carry on my body the marks of Jesus.

## Galatians 6:18
May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, dear friends. Amen.
