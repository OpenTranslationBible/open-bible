# Galatians Chapter 1

## Galatians 1:1
Paul, an apostle—not sent from men nor through human means, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead—

## Galatians 1:2
and all the brothers with me, To the churches in Galatia:

## Galatians 1:3
Grace and peace to you from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,

## Galatians 1:4
who gave himself for our sins to deliver us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,

## Galatians 1:5
to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.

## Galatians 1:6
I am surprised that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ, for a different gospel—

## Galatians 1:7
which is not really another gospel; but there are some who are unsettling you and wish to alter the gospel of Christ.

## Galatians 1:8
But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should proclaim a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let them be accursed!

## Galatians 1:9
As we have said before, so now I say again: if anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received, let them be accursed!

## Galatians 1:10
Am I now seeking the approval of people, or of God? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ.

## Galatians 1:11
I want you to understand, dear friends, that the gospel I proclaimed is not derived from human sources.

## Galatians 1:12
I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it through a revelation from Jesus Christ.

## Galatians 1:13
For you have heard of my former way of life in Judaism, how I intensely persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it.

## Galatians 1:14
I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries among my people, being extremely zealous for the traditions of my ancestors.

## Galatians 1:15
But when he who set me apart from my mother’s womb and called me by his grace was pleased

## Galatians 1:16
to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with any human being,

## Galatians 1:17
nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went into Arabia and later returned to Damascus.

## Galatians 1:18
Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Cephas and stayed with him for fifteen days.

## Galatians 1:19
I met none of the other apostles except James, the Lord’s brother.

## Galatians 1:20
I assure you before God that what I am writing to you is not a lie.

## Galatians 1:21
Then I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.

## Galatians 1:22
I remained unknown by face to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.

## Galatians 1:23
They only heard the report: “The man who once persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.”

## Galatians 1:24
And they glorified God because of me.
