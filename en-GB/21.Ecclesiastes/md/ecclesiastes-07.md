# Ecclesiastes Chapter 7

## Ecclesiastes 7:1
A good name is more desirable than fine oil, and the day of death is better than the day of birth.

## Ecclesiastes 7:2
It is preferable to visit a house of mourning than a house of feasting, for death is the fate of everyone, and the living should take this to heart.

## Ecclesiastes 7:3
Sorrow is preferable to laughter, for a sad face may lead to a happy heart.

## Ecclesiastes 7:4
The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, while the heart of fools is in the house of pleasure.

## Ecclesiastes 7:5
It is better to heed the rebuke of the wise than to listen to the song of fools.

## Ecclesiastes 7:6
As the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of fools. This too is vanity.

## Ecclesiastes 7:7
Oppression may make a wise person act foolishly, and a bribe corrupts the heart.

## Ecclesiastes 7:8
The conclusion of a matter is better than its beginning, and patience is superior to pride.

## Ecclesiastes 7:9
Do not be quick to anger, for anger resides in the bosom of fools.

## Ecclesiastes 7:10
Do not ask, “Why were the former days better than these?” For it is not wise to ask such questions.

## Ecclesiastes 7:11
Wisdom, like an inheritance, is a good thing and a benefit to those who see the sun.

## Ecclesiastes 7:12
Wisdom is a shelter, as money is a shelter, but the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the life of its possessor.

## Ecclesiastes 7:13
Consider the work of God: Who can straighten what He has made crooked?

## Ecclesiastes 7:14
In times of prosperity be joyful, but in times of adversity consider: God has made one as well as the other, so that no one can discover what will come after them.

## Ecclesiastes 7:15
In my fleeting life, I have seen both: the righteous perishing in their righteousness, and the wicked living long in their wickedness.

## Ecclesiastes 7:16
Do not be overly righteous, nor be overly wise— why should you destroy yourself?

## Ecclesiastes 7:17
Do not be overly wicked, and do not be foolish— why should you die before your time?

## Ecclesiastes 7:18
It is good to grasp one and not let go of the other. Whoever fears God will avoid all extremes.

## Ecclesiastes 7:19
Wisdom gives strength to a wise person more than ten rulers in a city.

## Ecclesiastes 7:20
Indeed, there is no one on earth who is righteous, no one who does what is right and never sins.

## Ecclesiastes 7:21
Do not pay attention to every word people say, or you may hear your servant cursing you—

## Ecclesiastes 7:22
for you know in your heart that many times you yourself have cursed others.

## Ecclesiastes 7:23
I applied all this to wisdom and said, “I will be wise”— but it was beyond me.

## Ecclesiastes 7:24
What exists is distant and deep— who can discover it?

## Ecclesiastes 7:25
So I turned my mind to understand, to explore and to search out wisdom and the scheme of things, and to understand the folly of wickedness and the madness of folly.

## Ecclesiastes 7:26
I find more bitter than death the woman who is a snare, whose heart is a trap and whose hands are chains. The man who pleases God will escape her, but the sinner she will ensnare.

## Ecclesiastes 7:27
“Behold,” says the Teacher, “this is what I have discovered: Adding one thing to another to find an explanation—

## Ecclesiastes 7:28
while I was still searching but not finding— I found one upright man among a thousand, but not one upright woman among them all.

## Ecclesiastes 7:29
This only have I found: God created mankind upright, but they have sought out many schemes.”
