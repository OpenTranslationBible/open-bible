# Ecclesiastes Chapter 3

## Ecclesiastes 3:1
There is a time appointed for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens:

## Ecclesiastes 3:2
A time to be born and a time to pass away, a time to plant and a time to uproot what is planted,

## Ecclesiastes 3:3
A time to kill and a time to heal, a time to tear down and a time to build up,

## Ecclesiastes 3:4
A time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance,

## Ecclesiastes 3:5
A time to scatter stones and a time to gather them, a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing,

## Ecclesiastes 3:6
A time to search and a time to abandon the search, a time to keep and a time to discard,

## Ecclesiastes 3:7
A time to tear and a time to mend, a time to be silent and a time to speak,

## Ecclesiastes 3:8
A time to love and a time to hate, a time for war and a time for peace.

## Ecclesiastes 3:9
What do workers gain from their labour?

## Ecclesiastes 3:10
I have seen the task God has given to the human race to occupy themselves.

## Ecclesiastes 3:11
He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also placed eternity in the human heart, yet no one can comprehend what God has done from beginning to end.

## Ecclesiastes 3:12
I know that there is nothing better for people than to rejoice and to do good in their lifetime.

## Ecclesiastes 3:13
Moreover, that each person may eat and drink and find satisfaction in all their toil—this is the gift of God.

## Ecclesiastes 3:14
I know that everything God does will endure forever; nothing can be added to it, and nothing taken from it. God does this so that people will fear Him.

## Ecclesiastes 3:15
Whatever is has already been, and what will be has been before; and God calls the past to account.

## Ecclesiastes 3:16
Furthermore, I have seen under the sun that in the place of judgment there is wickedness, and in the place of justice there is wickedness.

## Ecclesiastes 3:17
I said to myself, “God will bring into judgment both the righteous and the wicked, for there is a time for every matter and every deed.”

## Ecclesiastes 3:18
I also said to myself regarding humans, “God tests them so that they may see that they are like the animals.”

## Ecclesiastes 3:19
For the fate of human beings and the fate of animals is the same: As one dies, so dies the other. They all have the same breath; humans have no advantage over animals. Everything is meaningless.

## Ecclesiastes 3:20
All return to the same place; all come from dust, and to dust all return.

## Ecclesiastes 3:21
Who can determine if the human spirit ascends upward and if the spirit of the animal descends into the earth?

## Ecclesiastes 3:22
So I saw that there is nothing better than for a person to be happy in their work, because that is their lot. For who can bring them to see what will happen after them?
