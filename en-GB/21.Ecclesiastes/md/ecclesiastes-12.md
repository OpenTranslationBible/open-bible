# Ecclesiastes Chapter 12

## Ecclesiastes 12:1
Remember your Creator in the days of your youth, before the days of adversity arrive and the years draw near when you will say, “I find no pleasure in them”—

## Ecclesiastes 12:2
before the sun and the light, the moon and the stars grow dim, and the clouds return after the rain;

## Ecclesiastes 12:3
when the guardians of the house tremble, and the strong men stoop, when the grinders cease because they are few, and those who look through the windows grow dim;

## Ecclesiastes 12:4
when the doors to the street are closed and the sound of grinding fades; when one rises at the sound of a bird, and all the daughters of song are brought low;

## Ecclesiastes 12:5
when people fear heights and dangers in the streets; when the almond tree blossoms, the grasshopper drags itself along, and the caper berry fails. For man goes to his eternal home, and mourners go about the streets.

## Ecclesiastes 12:6
Remember your Creator before the silver cord is severed, and the golden bowl is broken; before the pitcher is shattered at the spring, and the wheel is broken at the well,

## Ecclesiastes 12:7
and the dust returns to the ground as it was, and the spirit goes back to God who gave it.

“Utter futility,” says the Teacher, “all is futile!”

In addition to being wise, the Teacher also imparted knowledge to the people. He pondered, searched out, and arranged many proverbs.

## Ecclesiastes 12:10
The Teacher sought to find the right words and to write words of truth accurately.

## Ecclesiastes 12:11
The words of the wise are like goads, and their collected sayings like firmly embedded nails—given by one Shepherd.

## Ecclesiastes 12:12
But beyond this, my son, be warned: of making many books there is no end, and much study wearies the body.

## Ecclesiastes 12:13
Now all has been heard; here is the conclusion of the matter: fear God and keep His commandments, for this is the duty of all people.

## Ecclesiastes 12:14
For God will evaluate every action, including all that is hidden, whether it is good or bad.
