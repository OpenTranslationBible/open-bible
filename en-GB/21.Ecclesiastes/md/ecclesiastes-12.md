# Ecclesiastes Chapter 12

## Ecclesiastes 12:1

Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth,  
Before the evil days come and the years approach  
When you will say, “I have no pleasure in them”;

## Ecclesiastes 12:2

Before the sun, the light, the moon, and the stars are darkened,  
And clouds return after the rain;

## Ecclesiastes 12:3

On the day that the watchmen of the house tremble,  
And strong men stoop,  
The grinding ones stand idle because they are few,  
And those who look through windows grow dim;

## Ecclesiastes 12:4

And the doors on the street are shut as the sound of the grinding mill is low,  
And one will arise at the sound of the bird,  
And all the daughters of song will sing softly.

## Ecclesiastes 12:5

Furthermore, people are afraid of a high place and of terrors on the road;  
The almond tree blossoms,  
The grasshopper drags itself along,  
And the caper berry is ineffective.  
For man goes to his eternal home while the mourners move about in the street.

## Ecclesiastes 12:6

Remember your Creator before the silver cord is broken  
And the golden bowl is crushed,  
The pitcher is shattered at the spring  
And the wheel at the cistern is crushed;

## Ecclesiastes 12:7

Then the dust will return to the earth as it was,  
And the spirit will return to God who gave it.

## Ecclesiastes 12:8

“Vanity of vanities,” says the Preacher,  
“All is vanity!”

## Ecclesiastes 12:9

In addition to being wise, the Preacher also taught the people knowledge;  
And he pondered, searched out, and arranged many proverbs.

## Ecclesiastes 12:10

The Preacher sought to find delightful words and to write words of truth correctly.

## Ecclesiastes 12:11

The words of the wise are like goads,  
And masters of collections are like well-driven nails;  
They are given by one Shepherd.

## Ecclesiastes 12:12

But beyond this, my son, be warned:  
The writing of many books is endless,  
And excessive study is wearying to the body.

## Ecclesiastes 12:13

The conclusion, when everything has been heard, is:  
Fear God and keep His commandments,  
Because this applies to every person.

## Ecclesiastes 12:14

For God will bring every act to judgment,  
Everything which is hidden, whether it is good or evil.
