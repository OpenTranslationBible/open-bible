# Ecclesiastes Chapter 2

## Ecclesiastes 2:1
I said to myself, “Come now, I will test you with pleasure to discover what is worthwhile.” Yet this too turned out to be futile.

## Ecclesiastes 2:2
I said of laughter, “It is madness,” and of pleasure, “What does it achieve?”

## Ecclesiastes 2:3
I sought to cheer myself with wine, embracing folly—my mind still guiding me with wisdom—to discern what is good for people to do under the heavens during the brief span of their lives.

## Ecclesiastes 2:4
I embarked on great works: I constructed houses for myself and planted vineyards.

## Ecclesiastes 2:5
I created gardens and parks, and planted all kinds of fruit trees within them.

## Ecclesiastes 2:6
I constructed reservoirs to water groves of flourishing trees.

## Ecclesiastes 2:7
I acquired male and female servants, and had servants born in my household. I also owned more herds and flocks than anyone before me in Jerusalem.

## Ecclesiastes 2:8
I accumulated silver and gold for myself, and the treasures of kings and provinces. I procured male and female singers, and the pleasures of men: many concubines.

## Ecclesiastes 2:9
I became greater than anyone who had preceded me in Jerusalem. In all this, my wisdom remained with me.

## Ecclesiastes 2:10
I denied my eyes nothing they desired; I withheld no pleasure from my heart. My heart rejoiced in all my labour, and this was the reward for all my toil.

## Ecclesiastes 2:11
Yet when I surveyed all that my hands had accomplished and what I had toiled to achieve, everything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind; there was no profit under the sun.

## Ecclesiastes 2:12
Then I turned my thoughts to consider wisdom, madness, and folly. What more can the successor to the king do than what has already been done?

## Ecclesiastes 2:13
I saw that wisdom is superior to folly, just as light is superior to darkness.

## Ecclesiastes 2:14
The wise have eyes in their heads, while the fool walks in darkness; yet I realised that the same fate befalls them both.

## Ecclesiastes 2:15
Then I said to myself, “The fate of the fool will overtake me also. What then is the benefit of being wise?” I said to myself, “This too is meaningless.”

## Ecclesiastes 2:16
For the wise, like the fool, will not be remembered for long; in days to come both will be forgotten. Like the fool, the wise too must die!

## Ecclesiastes 2:17
So I loathed life, because the work done under the sun was grievous to me. All of it is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.

## Ecclesiastes 2:18
I detested all the things I had toiled for under the sun, because I must leave them to the one who comes after me.

## Ecclesiastes 2:19
And who knows whether that person will be wise or foolish? Yet they will have control over all the fruit of my toil into which I have poured my effort and skill under the sun. This too is meaningless.

## Ecclesiastes 2:20
So my heart began to despair over all my toilsome labour under the sun.

## Ecclesiastes 2:21
For a person may labour with wisdom, knowledge, and skill, and then they must leave all they own to another who has not toiled for it. This too is meaningless and a great misfortune.

## Ecclesiastes 2:22
What do people gain from all their toil and anxious striving with which they labour under the sun?

## Ecclesiastes 2:23
All their days their work is grief and pain; even at night their minds do not rest. This too is meaningless.

## Ecclesiastes 2:24
There is nothing better for a person than to eat, drink, and find satisfaction in their toil. This too, I see, is from the hand of God,

## Ecclesiastes 2:25
for who can eat or find enjoyment apart from Him?

## Ecclesiastes 2:26
To the person who pleases Him, God gives wisdom, knowledge, and happiness, but to the sinner, He assigns the task of gathering and storing up wealth to hand it over to the one who pleases God. This too is meaningless, a chasing after the wind.
