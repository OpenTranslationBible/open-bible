# Ecclesiastes Chapter 2

## Ecclesiastes 2:1

I said to myself, “Come now, I will test you with pleasure.  
So enjoy yourself.”  
And behold, it too was futility.

## Ecclesiastes 2:2

I said of laughter, “It is madness,”  
And of pleasure, “What does it accomplish?”

## Ecclesiastes 2:3

I explored with my mind how to refresh my body with wine—  
While my mind was guiding me wisely—  
And how to seize foolishness,  
Until I could see what good there is for the sons of mankind  
To do under heaven the few years of their lives.

## Ecclesiastes 2:4

I enlarged my works:  
I built houses for myself,  
I planted vineyards for myself;

## Ecclesiastes 2:5

I made gardens and parks for myself,  
And I planted in them all kinds of fruit trees;

## Ecclesiastes 2:6

I made ponds of water for myself  
From which to irrigate a forest of growing trees.

## Ecclesiastes 2:7

I bought male and female slaves,  
And I had slaves born in my house.  
I also possessed flocks and herds larger than all who preceded me in Jerusalem.

## Ecclesiastes 2:8

I also amassed for myself silver and gold,  
And the treasure of kings and provinces;  
I provided for myself male and female singers  
And the pleasures of mankind—many concubines.

## Ecclesiastes 2:9

Then I became great and increased more than all who preceded me in Jerusalem.  
My wisdom also stood by me.

## Ecclesiastes 2:10

All that my eyes desired I did not refuse them.  
I did not restrain my heart from any pleasure,  
For my heart was pleased because of all my labour,  
And this was my reward for all my labour.

## Ecclesiastes 2:11

So I considered all my activities which my hands had done  
And the labour which I had exerted,  
And behold, all was vanity and striving after wind,  
And there was no benefit under the sun.

## Ecclesiastes 2:12

So I turned to consider wisdom, madness, and folly;  
For what will the man do who will come after the king,  
Except what has already been done?

## Ecclesiastes 2:13

And I saw that wisdom surpasses foolishness  
As light surpasses darkness.

## Ecclesiastes 2:14

The wise person’s eyes are in his head,  
But the fool walks in darkness.  
And yet I know that the same fate happens to both of them.

## Ecclesiastes 2:15

Then I said to myself,  
“As is the fate of the fool, so it will also happen to me.  
Why then have I been extremely wise?”  
So I said to myself, “This too is futility.”

## Ecclesiastes 2:16

For there is no lasting remembrance of the wise,  
Nor of the fool,  
Since in the days to come everything will soon be forgotten.  
And how the wise and the fool die alike!

## Ecclesiastes 2:17

So I hated life,  
For the work which had been done under the sun was unhappy to me;  
Because everything is futility and striving after wind.

---

## Ecclesiastes 2:18

So I hated all the fruit of my labour  
For which I had laboured under the sun,  
Because I must leave it to the person who will come after me.

## Ecclesiastes 2:19

And who knows whether he will be wise or a fool?  
Yet he will have control over all the fruit of my labour  
For which I have laboured by acting wisely under the sun.  
This too is vanity.

## Ecclesiastes 2:20

So I turned aside and gave my heart up to despair  
Over all the labour for which I had laboured under the sun.

## Ecclesiastes 2:21

When there is a person who has laboured with wisdom, knowledge, and skill,  
Then he gives his legacy to one who has not laboured for it.  
This too is vanity and a great evil.

## Ecclesiastes 2:22

For what does a person get in all his labour  
And in his striving with which he labours under the sun?

## Ecclesiastes 2:23

Because all his days his work is painful and burdensome;  
Even at night his mind does not rest.  
This too is vanity.

---

## Ecclesiastes 2:24

There is nothing better for a person  
Than to eat and drink and have his soul enjoy his labour.  
This too I have seen, that it is from the hand of God.

## Ecclesiastes 2:25

For who can eat and who can have enjoyment without Him?

## Ecclesiastes 2:26

For to a person who is good in His sight  
He has given wisdom and knowledge and joy,  
While to the sinner He has given the task of gathering and collecting  
So that he may give to one who is good in God’s sight.  
This too is vanity and striving after wind.
