# Ecclesiastes Chapter 9

## Ecclesiastes 9:1
I contemplated all this and determined that the righteous, the wise, and their deeds are in the hands of God. Yet, no one knows whether love or hatred lies ahead of them.

## Ecclesiastes 9:2
All share the same fate: the righteous and the wicked, the good and the bad, the clean and the unclean, those who offer sacrifices and those who do not. As it is with the good, so it is with the sinner; the one who swears an oath is as the one who fears to swear.

## Ecclesiastes 9:3
This is the evil in all that occurs under the sun: the same destiny befalls everyone. Moreover, the hearts of people are filled with evil, and madness resides in their hearts while they live, and afterwards they join the dead.

## Ecclesiastes 9:4
For anyone who is among the living, there is hope; indeed, a live dog is better than a dead lion.

## Ecclesiastes 9:5
The living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing; they have no further reward, and even their memory is forgotten.

## Ecclesiastes 9:6
Their love, their hate, and their zeal have long since vanished; never again will they have a part in anything that happens under the sun.

## Ecclesiastes 9:7
Go then, eat your bread with gladness, and drink your wine with a joyful heart, for God has already approved your deeds.

## Ecclesiastes 9:8
Ensure your garments are always white, and do not let oil be lacking on your head.

## Ecclesiastes 9:9
Enjoy life with your beloved wife all the days of your futile life that God has given you under the sun—all your futile days. For this is your portion in life and in your labour under the sun.

## Ecclesiastes 9:10
Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might, for in Sheol, where you are going, there is neither activity nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom.

## Ecclesiastes 9:11
I observed again under the sun that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor does bread come to the wise, or wealth to the discerning, or favour to the skilled; but time and chance overtake them all.

## Ecclesiastes 9:12
Indeed, no one knows when their time will come: like fish caught in a treacherous net, or birds trapped in a snare, so people are ensnared at an evil time when it suddenly falls upon them.

## Ecclesiastes 9:13
I also saw this example of wisdom under the sun, and it greatly impressed me:

## Ecclesiastes 9:14
There was a small city with few inhabitants, and a great king came against it, surrounded it, and built large siegeworks against it.

## Ecclesiastes 9:15
Within it lived a poor yet wise man, and he saved the city by his wisdom. Yet no one remembered that poor man.

## Ecclesiastes 9:16
So I said, “Wisdom is better than strength.” Nevertheless, the wisdom of the poor man is despised, and his words are no longer heeded.

## Ecclesiastes 9:17
The quiet words of the wise are to be heeded more than the shouts of a ruler among fools.

## Ecclesiastes 9:18
Wisdom surpasses weapons of war, yet a single sinner can undo much good.
