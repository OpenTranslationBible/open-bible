# Ecclesiastes Chapter 4

## Ecclesiastes 4:1
Once more, I observed all the acts of oppression that occur under the sun. I saw the tears of the oppressed, and they had no comforter; power was on the side of their oppressors, and they had no comforter.

## Ecclesiastes 4:2
I concluded that the dead who have already passed are more fortunate than the living who are still alive.

## Ecclesiastes 4:3
Yet better than both is the one who has never been born, who has not witnessed the evil deeds done under the sun.

## Ecclesiastes 4:4
I noticed that all labour and all achievement stem from one person's rivalry with another. This too is vanity, a pursuit of the wind.

## Ecclesiastes 4:5
The fool folds his hands and consumes his own flesh.

## Ecclesiastes 4:6
Better is one handful with tranquillity than two handfuls with toil and chasing after the wind.

## Ecclesiastes 4:7
Again, I observed something futile under the sun:

## Ecclesiastes 4:8
There was a man who was alone, without a son or brother. There was no end to his toil, yet his eyes were not satisfied with wealth. "For whom am I toiling," he asked, "and depriving myself of enjoyment?" This too is vanity, and a miserable task.

## Ecclesiastes 4:9
Two are better than one because they have a good return for their labour:

## Ecclesiastes 4:10
If one falls, the other can lift him up. But pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up.

## Ecclesiastes 4:11
Moreover, if two lie down together, they will keep warm. But how can one keep warm alone?

## Ecclesiastes 4:12
Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves. A cord of three strands is not easily broken.

## Ecclesiastes 4:13
Better is a poor but wise youth than an old and foolish king who no longer knows how to take advice.

## Ecclesiastes 4:14
For he may have come from prison to become king, even though he was born poor in his kingdom.

## Ecclesiastes 4:15
I observed all who live and walk under the sun following the youth, the successor to the throne.

## Ecclesiastes 4:16
There is no end to all the people who were before them, yet those who come later will not be pleased with him. This too is vanity, a chasing after the wind.
