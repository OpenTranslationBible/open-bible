# Ecclesiastes Chapter 5

## Ecclesiastes 5:1
Be cautious as you enter the house of God, and approach to listen rather than to present the offering of fools, who are unaware that they are doing wrong.

## Ecclesiastes 5:2
Do not be rash with your mouth, nor hasty in your heart to bring up a matter before God. For God is in heaven and you are on earth, so let your words be few.

## Ecclesiastes 5:3
For dreams come with much busyness, and a fool's voice with many words.

## Ecclesiastes 5:4
When you make a vow to God, do not delay in fulfilling it. He takes no pleasure in fools; fulfil what you vow.

## Ecclesiastes 5:5
It is better not to vow than to make a vow and not fulfil it.

## Ecclesiastes 5:6
Do not let your mouth lead you into sin, and do not say before the messenger of God that it was a mistake. Why should God be angry at your words and destroy the work of your hands?

## Ecclesiastes 5:7
For in many dreams and many words, there is futility. Instead, stand in awe of God.

## Ecclesiastes 5:8
If you see the oppression of the poor and the denial of justice and rights in a province, do not be astonished at the matter; for one official is watched by a higher one, and there are higher officials over them.

## Ecclesiastes 5:9
The produce of the land is shared by all; even the king benefits from the fields.

## Ecclesiastes 5:10
Whoever loves money will never have enough; whoever loves wealth will not be satisfied with their income. This too is vanity.

## Ecclesiastes 5:11
As goods increase, so do those who consume them. What advantage then do the owners have except to gaze upon them?

## Ecclesiastes 5:12
The sleep of the labourer is sweet, whether he eats little or much, but the abundance of the rich will not allow them to sleep.

## Ecclesiastes 5:13
There is a grievous evil I have seen under the sun: wealth hoarded to the detriment of its owner,

## Ecclesiastes 5:14
or wealth lost through unfortunate circumstances, leaving nothing for their children to inherit.

## Ecclesiastes 5:15
As one comes naked from their mother's womb, so they will depart as they came. They will take nothing from their toil that they can carry in their hands.

## Ecclesiastes 5:16
This too is a grievous evil: exactly as one comes, so they will depart. What gain is there for those who toil for the wind?

## Ecclesiastes 5:17
All their days they eat in darkness, with great frustration, sickness, and anger.

## Ecclesiastes 5:18
This is what I have observed to be good and fitting: to eat, to drink, and to find satisfaction in all one's labour under the sun during the few days of life God has given them—for this is their reward.

## Ecclesiastes 5:19
Moreover, when God gives someone wealth and possessions, and the ability to enjoy them, to accept their lot and find joy in their toil—this is a gift from God.

## Ecclesiastes 5:20
They seldom reflect on the days of their life, because God keeps them occupied with joy in their heart.
