# Ecclesiastes Chapter 8

## Ecclesiastes 8:1
Who is comparable to the wise, and who understands the meaning of a matter? Wisdom brightens a person's face and softens its sternness.

## Ecclesiastes 8:2
I advise you to keep the king's command because of the oath made before God.

## Ecclesiastes 8:3
Do not be quick to leave his presence. Do not support an evil matter, for he will act as he wishes.

## Ecclesiastes 8:4
Since the king's word is authoritative, who can question him, “What are you doing?”

## Ecclesiastes 8:5
Whoever obeys his command will face no harm, and a wise heart knows the proper time and procedure.

## Ecclesiastes 8:6
For there is a proper time and procedure for every matter, though a person's troubles weigh heavily upon them.

## Ecclesiastes 8:7
Since no one knows what will happen, who can tell them when it will occur?

## Ecclesiastes 8:8
No one has power over the wind to restrain it, nor authority over the day of death; just as there is no discharge in time of war, wickedness will not deliver those who practice it.

## Ecclesiastes 8:9
All this I have observed, applying my mind to everything done under the sun, during a time when one person exercises power over another to their detriment.

## Ecclesiastes 8:10
Then I saw the wicked buried, those who frequented the holy place and were praised in the city where they did so. This too is vanity.

## Ecclesiastes 8:11
Because the sentence against wrongdoing is not executed swiftly, therefore the hearts of people are filled with schemes to do evil.

## Ecclesiastes 8:12
Although a sinner does evil a hundred times and prolongs his life, I am certain that it will be well with those who fear God, who revere Him openly.

## Ecclesiastes 8:13
But it will not go well for the wicked, nor will they prolong their days like a shadow, because they do not fear God.

## Ecclesiastes 8:14
There is a vanity that occurs on earth: righteous people who receive what the wicked deserve, and wicked people who receive what the righteous deserve. I say that this too is vanity.

## Ecclesiastes 8:15
So I commend enjoyment, for there is nothing better for a person under the sun than to eat, drink, and be joyful, for this will accompany them in their labour throughout the days of life God has given them under the sun.

## Ecclesiastes 8:16
When I set my mind to understand wisdom and to observe the business done on earth, even though people never sleep day or night,

## Ecclesiastes 8:17
then I saw all the work of God. No one can comprehend what happens under the sun. Despite all their efforts to search it out, no one can discover its meaning. Even if the wise claim to know, they cannot truly grasp it.
