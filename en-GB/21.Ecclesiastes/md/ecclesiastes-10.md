# Ecclesiastes Chapter 10

## Ecclesiastes 10:1

Dead flies turn a perfumer’s oil rancid,

Even when the fool walks along the road, his sense is lacking,  
And he demonstrates to everyone that he is a fool.

## Ecclesiastes 10:4

If the ruler’s temper rises against you,  
Do not abandon your position,  
Because composure puts great offences to rest.

## Ecclesiastes 10:5

While the rich sit in humble places.

If the snake bites before being charmed,  
There is no benefit to the charmer.

Words from the mouth of a wise person are gracious,  
But the lips of a fool consume him;

## Ecclesiastes 10:13

The beginning of his talking is foolishness,  
And the end of it is evil insanity.

Yet the fool multiplies words.  
No person knows what will happen,  
And who can tell him what will come after him?

The labour of a fool makes him so weary  
That he does not even know how to go to a city.

Woe to you, land whose king is a boy,  
And whose princes feast in the morning.

## Ecclesiastes 10:17

Blessed are you, land whose king is of nobility,  
And whose princes eat at the appropriate time—  
For strength, and not for drunkenness.

## Ecclesiastes 10:18

Through extreme laziness the rafters sag,  
And through idleness the house leaks.

## Ecclesiastes 10:19

People prepare a meal for enjoyment,  
Wine makes life joyful,  
And money is the answer to everything.

## Ecclesiastes 10:20

Furthermore, in your bedroom do not curse a king,  
Nor in your sleeping rooms curse a rich person,  
For a bird of the sky may carry the sound,  
And the winged creature may report the matter.
