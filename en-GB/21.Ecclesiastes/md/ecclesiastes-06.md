# Ecclesiastes Chapter 6

## Ecclesiastes 6:1

There is an evil which I have seen under the sun,  
And it is prevalent among mankind:

## Ecclesiastes 6:2

A person to whom God has given riches, wealth, and honour  
So that his soul lacks nothing of all that he desires;  
Yet God has not empowered him to enjoy them,  
For a stranger enjoys them instead.  
This is futility and a severe affliction.

## Ecclesiastes 6:3

If a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years,  
However many they may be,  
But his soul is not satisfied with good things,  
And he does not even have a proper burial,  
Then I say, better the miscarriage than he.

## Ecclesiastes 6:4

For it comes in futility and goes into darkness,  
And its name is covered in darkness.

## Ecclesiastes 6:5

It has not seen the sun nor known anything;  
Yet it is better off than he.

## Ecclesiastes 6:6

Even if the man lives a thousand years twice and does not enjoy good things—  
Do not all go to the same place?

## Ecclesiastes 6:7

All a person’s labour is for his mouth,  
And yet his appetite is not satisfied.

## Ecclesiastes 6:8

For what advantage does the wise person have over the fool?  
What does the poor person have, knowing how to walk before the living?

## Ecclesiastes 6:9

What the eyes see is better than what the soul desires.  
This too is futility and striving after wind.

## Ecclesiastes 6:10

Whatever exists has already been named,  
And it is known what man is;  
For he cannot dispute with one who is stronger than he.

## Ecclesiastes 6:11

For there are many words which increase futility.  
What then is the advantage to a person?

## Ecclesiastes 6:12

For who knows what is good for a person during his lifetime,  
During the few years of his futile life?  
He will spend them like a shadow.  
For who can tell a person what will happen after him under the sun?
