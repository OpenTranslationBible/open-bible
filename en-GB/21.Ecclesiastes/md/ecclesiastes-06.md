# Ecclesiastes Chapter 6

## Ecclesiastes 6:1
I have observed an evil under the sun, and it is prevalent among humanity:

## Ecclesiastes 6:2
God grants individuals riches, wealth, and honour, so that they lack nothing their heart desires, yet God does not allow them the capacity to enjoy them, and instead, a stranger enjoys them. This is vanity and a severe misfortune.

## Ecclesiastes 6:3
If a man has a hundred children and lives many years, no matter how long, but he cannot enjoy his wealth and does not receive a proper burial, then I say a stillborn child is better off than he.

## Ecclesiastes 6:4
For it comes in futility and departs into darkness, and its name is enveloped in darkness.

## Ecclesiastes 6:5
Though it has not seen the sun or known anything, it finds more rest than that man.

## Ecclesiastes 6:6
Even if he lives two thousand years but does not enjoy his prosperityâ€”do not all go to the same place?

## Ecclesiastes 6:7
All one's labour is for the mouth, yet the appetite is never satisfied.

## Ecclesiastes 6:8
What advantage does the wise have over the fool? What benefit does the poor have in knowing how to conduct themselves among the living?

## Ecclesiastes 6:9
Better is what the eyes see than the wandering of desire. This too is vanity, a pursuit of the wind.

## Ecclesiastes 6:10
Whatever exists has already been named, and what humanity is has been known; no one can contend with one who is mightier.

## Ecclesiastes 6:11
The more words, the greater the vanity, and what profit is there to anyone?

## Ecclesiastes 6:12
For who knows what is good for a person in life, during the few and futile days they pass like a shadow? Who can inform them what will occur under the sun after they are gone?
