# Ecclesiastes Chapter 1

## Ecclesiastes 1:1

The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.

## Ecclesiastes 1:2

“Vanity of vanities,” says the Preacher,  
“Vanity of vanities! All is vanity.”

## Ecclesiastes 1:3

What advantage does a person have in all his work  
Which he does under the sun?

## Ecclesiastes 1:4

A generation goes and a generation comes,  
But the earth remains forever.

## Ecclesiastes 1:5

The sun rises and the sun sets;  
And hurrying to its place it rises there again.

## Ecclesiastes 1:6

Blowing toward the south,  
Then turning toward the north,  
The wind continues swirling along;  
And on its circular courses the wind returns.

## Ecclesiastes 1:7

All the rivers flow into the sea,  
Yet the sea is not full.  
To the place where the rivers flow,  
There they flow again.

## Ecclesiastes 1:8

All things are wearisome;  
No one can tell it.  
The eye is not satisfied with seeing,  
Nor is the ear filled with hearing.

## Ecclesiastes 1:9

That which has been is what will be,  
And that which has been done is what will be done.  
So there is nothing new under the sun.

## Ecclesiastes 1:10

Is there anything of which one might say, “See this, it is new”?  
It has already existed for ages  
Which were before us.

## Ecclesiastes 1:11

There is no remembrance of earlier things,  
And also of the later things which will occur,  
There will be no remembrance of them  
Among those who will come later still.

## Ecclesiastes 1:12

I, the Preacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.

## Ecclesiastes 1:13

And I set my mind to seek and explore by wisdom  
Concerning everything that has been done under heaven.  
It is a grievous task which God has given to the sons of mankind to be afflicted with.

## Ecclesiastes 1:14

I have seen all the works which have been done under the sun,  
And behold, all is vanity and striving after wind.

## Ecclesiastes 1:15

What is crooked cannot be straightened,  
And what is lacking cannot be counted.

## Ecclesiastes 1:16

I said to myself, “Behold, I have magnified and increased wisdom  
More than all who were over Jerusalem before me;  
And my mind has observed a wealth of wisdom and knowledge.”

## Ecclesiastes 1:17

And I applied my mind to know wisdom and to know madness and folly;  
I realised that this also is striving after wind.

## Ecclesiastes 1:18

Because in much wisdom there is much grief;  
And increasing knowledge results in increasing pain.
