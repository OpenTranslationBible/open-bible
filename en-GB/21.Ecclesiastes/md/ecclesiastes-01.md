# Ecclesiastes Chapter 1

## Ecclesiastes 1:1
The words of the Teacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.

## Ecclesiastes 1:2
“Vanity of vanities,” says the Teacher, “Vanity of vanities! All is vanity.”

## Ecclesiastes 1:3
What do people gain from all their work at which they toil under the sun?

## Ecclesiastes 1:4
Generations come and generations go, but the earth remains forever.

## Ecclesiastes 1:5
The sun rises and the sun sets, and hurries back to its place where it rises again.

## Ecclesiastes 1:6
The wind blows towards the south and turns to the north; round and round it goes, returning on its course.

## Ecclesiastes 1:7
All rivers flow into the sea, yet the sea is never full. To the place where the rivers come from, there they return again.

## Ecclesiastes 1:8
All things are wearisome, more than one can express. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.

## Ecclesiastes 1:9
What has been will be again, and what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.

## Ecclesiastes 1:10
Is there anything of which one can say, “Look! This is something new”? It has already existed in ages past.

## Ecclesiastes 1:11
There is no remembrance of former things, nor will there be any remembrance of later things by those who come after.

## Ecclesiastes 1:12
I, the Teacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.

## Ecclesiastes 1:13
I applied my mind to seek and explore by wisdom all that is done under heaven. It is a burdensome task God has given to the sons of men.

## Ecclesiastes 1:14
I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are vanity and a chasing after the wind.

## Ecclesiastes 1:15
What is crooked cannot be made straight; what is lacking cannot be counted.

## Ecclesiastes 1:16
I said to myself, “Behold, I have increased in wisdom more than anyone who has ruled over Jerusalem before me; I have experienced a great deal of wisdom and knowledge.”

## Ecclesiastes 1:17
Then I applied my mind to know wisdom and also madness and folly, but I learned that this too is a chasing after the wind.

## Ecclesiastes 1:18
For with much wisdom comes much sorrow; the more knowledge, the more pain.
