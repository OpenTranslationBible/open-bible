# Philippians Chapter 3

## Philippians 3:1
Finally, my brothers and sisters, rejoice in the Lord! Writing the same things to you again is no trouble for me, and it is a safeguard for you.

## Philippians 3:2
Beware of those dogs, those evildoers, those who mutilate the flesh.

## Philippians 3:3
For we are the true circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God, who boast in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh—

## Philippians 3:4
though I myself have reasons for confidence in the flesh. If anyone else thinks they have reasons to be confident in the flesh, I have more:

## Philippians 3:5
circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; regarding the law, a Pharisee;

## Philippians 3:6
regarding zeal, persecuting the church; regarding righteousness based on the law, faultless.

## Philippians 3:7
Yet, whatever advantages I had, I now regard as loss for the sake of Christ.

## Philippians 3:8
Indeed, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them rubbish, that I may gain Christ

## Philippians 3:9
and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own derived from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ—the righteousness that comes from God based on faith.

## Philippians 3:10
I want to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming like him in his death,

## Philippians 3:11
and so, in some way, attaining to the resurrection from the dead.

## Philippians 3:12
Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already been made perfect, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.

## Philippians 3:13
Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and striving towards what is ahead,

## Philippians 3:14
I press on towards the goal to win the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.

## Philippians 3:15
All of us, then, who are mature should take such a view of things. And if you think differently about anything, that too God will make clear to you.

## Philippians 3:16
Let us continue to live up to what we have already attained.

## Philippians 3:17
Join together in following my example, brothers and sisters, and observe those who live according to the pattern you have in us.

## Philippians 3:18
For, as I have often told you before and now tell you even with tears, many live as enemies of the cross of Christ.

## Philippians 3:19
Their end is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is in their shame. Their mind is set on earthly things.

## Philippians 3:20
However, our true home is in heaven, and we eagerly anticipate the coming of a Saviour from there, the Lord Jesus Christ,

## Philippians 3:21
who, by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control, will transform our lowly bodies to be like his glorious body.
