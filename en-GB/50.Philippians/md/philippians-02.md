# Philippians Chapter 2

## Philippians 2:1

Therefore if there is any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any fellowship in the Spirit, if any affection and compassion,

## Philippians 2:2

make my joy complete by being of one mind, sharing the same love, united in spirit, and focused on a single purpose.

## Philippians 2:3

Do nothing out of selfish ambition or empty conceit. Instead, in humility value others as more important than yourselves;

## Philippians 2:4

do not merely look out for your own interests, but also for the interests of others.

## Philippians 2:5

Have the same mindset among yourselves as was in Christ Jesus:

## Philippians 2:6

> Who, existing in the form of God,
> did not consider equality with God something to be grasped for his own advantage;

## Philippians 2:7

> but emptied himself
> by taking the form of a servant,
> being made in human likeness.

## Philippians 2:8

> And being found in appearance as a man,
> he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death,
> even death on a cross.

## Philippians 2:9

> Therefore God highly exalted him,
> and bestowed on him the name that is above every name,

## Philippians 2:10

> so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow,
> in heaven and on earth and under the earth,

## Philippians 2:11

> and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord,
> to the glory of God the Father.

## Philippians 2:12

So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence but now much more in my absence, continue to work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;

## Philippians 2:13

for it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to act in order to fulfil his good purpose.

## Philippians 2:14

Do everything without complaining or arguing,

## Philippians 2:15

so that you may become blameless and pure, as God's children without fault in a distorted and perverse generation. Then you will shine among them like stars in the sky,

## Philippians 2:16

as you hold firmly to the word of life. And then I will be able to take pride on the day of Christ that I did not run or labour in vain.

## Philippians 2:17

But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with all of you.

## Philippians 2:18

In the same way, you too should be glad and rejoice with me.

## Philippians 2:19

But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I also may be encouraged when I learn of your condition.

## Philippians 2:20

For I have no one else of kindred spirit who will genuinely care for your welfare.

## Philippians 2:21

For they all pursue their own interests, rather than those of Christ Jesus.

## Philippians 2:22

But you know of his proven character, that he served with me in the work of the gospel like a son with his father.

## Philippians 2:23

Therefore I hope to send him promptly, as soon as I see how things go with me;

## Philippians 2:24

and I am confident in the Lord that I myself will also come soon.

## Philippians 2:25

But I thought it necessary to send back to you Epaphroditus, my brother, co-worker and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and minister to my needs,

## Philippians 2:26

because he longs for all of you and is distressed because you heard he was ill.

## Philippians 2:27

For indeed he was ill, and almost died. But God had mercy on him, and not only on him but also on me, to spare me sorrow upon sorrow.

## Philippians 2:28

Therefore I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again you may rejoice and I may have less anxiety.

## Philippians 2:29

Welcome him then in the Lord with all joy, and hold people like him in high regard,

## Philippians 2:30

because he came close to death for the work of Christ, risking his life to make up for the help you could not give me.
