# Philippians Chapter 4

## Philippians 4:1
Therefore, my dear brothers and sisters, whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, stand firm in the Lord in this manner, my beloved friends.

## Philippians 4:2
I urge Euodia and I urge Syntyche to agree in the Lord.

## Philippians 4:3
Yes, I ask you, my true companion, to help these women who have struggled alongside me in the cause of the gospel, together with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.

## Philippians 4:4
Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice!

## Philippians 4:5
Let your gentleness be known to everyone. The Lord is near.

## Philippians 4:6
Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.

## Philippians 4:7
And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.

## Philippians 4:8
Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is honourable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable—if anything is excellent or worthy of praise—think about these things.

## Philippians 4:9
Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me, put these into practice. And the God of peace will be with you.

## Philippians 4:10
I greatly rejoiced in the Lord that at last you have renewed your concern for me. Indeed, you were concerned, but you lacked the opportunity to show it.

## Philippians 4:11
I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I find myself.

## Philippians 4:12
I know what it is to live in humble means, and I know what it is to live in abundance. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well-fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want.

## Philippians 4:13
I can do all things through Him who gives me strength.

## Philippians 4:14
Yet it was kind of you to share in my troubles.

## Philippians 4:15
Moreover, as you Philippians know, in the early days of your acquaintance with the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, not one church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving, except you alone.

## Philippians 4:16
For even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent me aid more than once for my needs.

## Philippians 4:17
Not that I seek the gift itself, but I seek the profit that increases to your account.

## Philippians 4:18
I have received full payment and have more than enough. I am amply supplied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent, a fragrant offering, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God.

## Philippians 4:19
And my God will supply all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.

## Philippians 4:20
To our God and Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

## Philippians 4:21
Greet all the saints in Christ Jesus. The brothers and sisters who are with me send their greetings.

## Philippians 4:22
All the saints send you greetings, especially those who belong to Caesar’s household.

## Philippians 4:23
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
