# Philippians Chapter 1

## Philippians 1:1

Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus,  
To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, including the overseers and deacons:

## Philippians 1:2

Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

## Philippians 1:3

I thank my God in all my remembrance of you,

## Philippians 1:4

Always offering prayer with joy in my every prayer for you all,

## Philippians 1:5

In view of your participation in the gospel from the first day until now.

## Philippians 1:6

For I am confident of this very thing, that He who began a good work among you will complete it by the day of Christ Jesus.

## Philippians 1:7

For it is only right for me to feel this way about you all, because I have you in my heart, since both in my imprisonment and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of grace with me.

## Philippians 1:8

For God is my witness, how I long for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus.

## Philippians 1:9

And this I pray, that your love may overflow still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment,

## Philippians 1:10

So that you may discover the things that are excellent, that you may be sincere and blameless for the day of Christ;

## Philippians 1:11

Having been filled with the fruit of righteousness which comes through Jesus Christ, for the glory and praise of God.

## Philippians 1:12

Now I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that my circumstances have turned out for the greater progress of the gospel,

## Philippians 1:13

So that my imprisonment for the cause of Christ has become well known throughout the praetorian guard and to everyone else,

## Philippians 1:14

And that most of the brothers and sisters, trusting in the Lord because of my imprisonment, have far more courage to speak the word of God without fear.

## Philippians 1:15

Some, to be sure, are preaching Christ even from envy and strife, but some also from goodwill;

## Philippians 1:16

The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defence of the gospel;

## Philippians 1:17

The former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition rather than from pure motives, thinking that they are causing me distress in my imprisonment.

## Philippians 1:18

What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and in this I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice,

## Philippians 1:19

For I know that this will turn out for my deliverance through your prayers and the provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,

## Philippians 1:20

According to my eager expectation and hope, that I will not be put to shame in anything, but that with all boldness, Christ will even now, as always, be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death.

## Philippians 1:21

For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain.

## Philippians 1:22

But if I am to live on in the flesh, this will mean fruitful labour for me; and I do not know which to choose.

## Philippians 1:23

But I am hard-pressed from both directions, having the desire to depart and be with Christ, for that is very much better;

## Philippians 1:24

Yet to remain in the flesh is more necessary for your sake.

## Philippians 1:25

Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy in the faith,

## Philippians 1:26

So that your pride in Christ Jesus may be abundant because of me by my coming to you again.

## Philippians 1:27

Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or remain absent, I will hear about you that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;

## Philippians 1:28

And in no way alarmed by your opponents—which is a sign of destruction for them, but of salvation for you, and this too, from God.

## Philippians 1:29

For to you it has been granted for Christ’s sake, not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer on His behalf,

## Philippians 1:30

Experiencing the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear to be in me.
