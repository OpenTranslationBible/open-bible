# Philippians Chapter 1

## Philippians 1:1
Paul and Timothy, bond-servants of Christ Jesus, To all God's holy people in Christ Jesus at Philippi, together with the overseers and deacons:

## Philippians 1:2
Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

## Philippians 1:3
I thank my God every time I remember you,

## Philippians 1:4
always offering prayer with joy in my every prayer for all of you,

## Philippians 1:5
because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now,

## Philippians 1:6
being confident of this, that He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion by the day of Christ Jesus.

## Philippians 1:7
It is right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in my heart, whether I am in chains or defending and confirming the gospel, all of you share in God's grace with me.

## Philippians 1:8
For God knows how much I long for all of you with the deep affection of Christ Jesus.

## Philippians 1:9
And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in real knowledge and depth of insight,

## Philippians 1:10
so that you may be able to discern what is truly important and may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ,

## Philippians 1:11
filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.

## Philippians 1:12
Now I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that my circumstances have actually served to advance the gospel.

## Philippians 1:13
As a result, it has become evident throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else that I am in chains for the cause of Christ.

## Philippians 1:14
And because of my chains, most of the brothers and sisters have become confident in the Lord and dare all the more to proclaim the word of God without fear.

## Philippians 1:15
Some indeed preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill.

## Philippians 1:16
The latter do so out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defence of the gospel.

## Philippians 1:17
The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing they can stir up trouble for me while I am in chains.

## Philippians 1:18
But what does it matter? The important thing is that in every way, whether from false motives or true, Christ is proclaimed. And because of this I rejoice. Yes, and I will continue to rejoice,

## Philippians 1:19
for I know that through your prayers and the provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, what has happened to me will turn out for my deliverance.

## Philippians 1:20
I eagerly expect and hope that I will never be ashamed, but will have sufficient courage so that now as always Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death.

## Philippians 1:21
For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.

## Philippians 1:22
If I am to go on living in the flesh, this will mean fruitful labour for me. Yet what shall I choose? I do not know!

## Philippians 1:23
I am caught between the two: I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better;

## Philippians 1:24
but it is more necessary for you that I remain in the flesh.

## Philippians 1:25
Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith,

## Philippians 1:26
so that through my being with you again your pride in Christ Jesus will abound on account of me.

## Philippians 1:27
Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you stand firm in one spirit, striving together as one for the faith of the gospel

## Philippians 1:28
without being intimidated in any way by those who oppose you. This is a sign to them that they will face destruction, but that you will be savedâ€”and that by God.

## Philippians 1:29
For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in Him, but also to endure hardships for Him,

## Philippians 1:30
since you are experiencing the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear that I still have.
