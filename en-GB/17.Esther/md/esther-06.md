# Esther Chapter 6

## Esther 6:1

That night, the king could not sleep, so he commanded that the book of the chronicles, the records of his reign, be brought and read to him.

## Esther 6:2

It was discovered there that Mordecai had reported Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs who guarded the entrance, who had plotted to attack King Xerxes.

## Esther 6:3

The king asked, “What honour or recognition has been given to Mordecai for this?” The king’s attendants replied, “Nothing has been done for him.”

## Esther 6:4

The king then said, “Who is in the court?” Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the palace to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows he had prepared for him.

## Esther 6:5

The king’s servants answered, “Haman is standing in the court.” The king said, “Bring him in.”

## Esther 6:6

When Haman came in, the king asked him, “What should be done for the man whom the king wishes to honour?”

---

Haman thought to himself, “Whom would the king wish to honour more than me?”

## Esther 6:7

So Haman said to the king, “For the man whom the king wishes to honour,

## Esther 6:8

let them bring a royal robe which the king has worn, and a horse on which the king has ridden, with a royal crest placed on its head.

## Esther 6:9

Let the robe and the horse be entrusted to one of the king’s most noble officials. Let them dress the man whom the king wishes to honour, and lead him on horseback through the city square, proclaiming before him, ‘This is what is done for the man whom the king wishes to honour!’”

## Esther 6:10

The king commanded Haman, “Go quickly, take the robe and the horse, as you have suggested, and do so for Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king’s gate. Do not neglect anything you have recommended.”

## Esther 6:11

So Haman took the robe and the horse, dressed Mordecai, and led him on horseback through the city square, proclaiming before him, “This is what is done for the man whom the king wishes to honour!”

## Esther 6:12

Afterward, Mordecai returned to the king’s gate, but Haman hurried home, mourning, with his head covered.

## Esther 6:13

Haman recounted to Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had happened to him.

---

His wise men and his wife Zeresh said to him, “If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of Jewish descent, you will not prevail against him, but will surely come to ruin.”

## Esther 6:14

While they were still speaking with him, the king’s eunuchs arrived and hastily brought Haman to the banquet Esther had prepared.
