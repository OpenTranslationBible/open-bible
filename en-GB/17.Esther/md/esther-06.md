# Esther Chapter 6

## Esther 6:1

During that night the king could not sleep,  
so he gave an order to bring the book of records, the chronicles,  
and they were read before the king.

## Esther 6:2

And it was found written what Mordecai had reported  
concerning Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs who were doorkeepers,  
that they had sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus.

## Esther 6:3

Then the king said,  
“What honour or dignity has been bestowed on Mordecai for this?”

And the king’s servants who attended him said,  
“Nothing has been done for him.”

---

## Esther 6:4

So the king said,  
“Who is in the courtyard?”  
Now Haman had just entered the outer courtyard of the king’s palace  
to speak to the king about having Mordecai hanged on the gallows  
which he had prepared for him.

## Esther 6:5

So the king’s servants said to him,  
“Behold, Haman is standing in the courtyard.”

And the king said, “Let him come in.”

---

## Esther 6:6

So Haman came in, and the king said to him,  
“What is to be done for the man whom the king desires to honour?”

---

And Haman said to himself,  
“Whom would the king desire to honour more than me?”

## Esther 6:7

Therefore Haman said to the king,  
“For the man whom the king desires to honour,

## Esther 6:8

have them bring a royal robe which the king has worn,  
and the horse on which the king has ridden,  
and on whose head a royal crown has been placed;

## Esther 6:9

and let the robe and the horse be handed over  
to one of the king’s most noble officials,  
and have them dress the man whom the king desires to honour,  
and lead him on horseback through the city square,  
and proclaim before him,  
‘So it shall be done for the man whom the king desires to honour!’”

---

## Esther 6:10

Then the king said to Haman,  
“Quickly, take the robe and the horse as you have said,  
and do so for Mordecai the Jew, who is sitting at the king’s gate;  
do not fail to do anything of all that you have said.”

---

## Esther 6:11

So Haman took the robe and the horse,  
and dressed Mordecai,  
and led him on horseback through the city square,  
and proclaimed before him,  
“So it shall be done for the man whom the king desires to honour.”

---

## Esther 6:12

Then Mordecai returned to the king’s gate.  
But Haman hurried to his house, mourning, with his head covered.

## Esther 6:13

Haman told his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that had happened to him.

---

Then his wise men and Zeresh his wife said to him,
“If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall,  
is of Jewish descent,  
you will not prevail over him, but will certainly fall before him.”

## Esther 6:14

While they were still talking with him,  
the king’s eunuchs arrived and hurriedly brought Haman  
to the banquet which Esther had prepared.
