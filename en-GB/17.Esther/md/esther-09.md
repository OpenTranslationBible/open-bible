# Esther Chapter 9

## Esther 9:1

In the twelfth month, the month of Adar, on the thirteenth day, when the king's command and edict were to be enacted, the day when the enemies of the Jews hoped to overpower them, it was reversed, and the Jews gained mastery over those who hated them.

## Esther 9:2

The Jews gathered in their cities throughout the provinces of King Xerxes to attack those who sought their harm, and no one could stand against them, for the fear of them had fallen upon all peoples.

## Esther 9:3

All the officials of the provinces, the satraps, the governors, and those who conducted the king's business supported the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai had overtaken them.

## Esther 9:4

Mordecai was prominent in the king's palace, and his fame spread throughout the provinces, for he became more and more powerful.

## Esther 9:5

The Jews struck down all their enemies with the sword, killing and destroying them, and they did as they pleased to those who hated them.

## Esther 9:6

Within the fortress of Susa, the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men.

## Esther 9:7

Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,

## Esther 9:8

Poratha, Adalia, and Aridatha,

## Esther 9:9

Parmashta, and Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha,

## Esther 9:10

the ten sons of Haman, son of Hammedatha, who was an adversary of the Jews. However, they did not take any plunder.

---

## Esther 9:11

On that day, the number of those killed in the citadel of Susa was reported to the king.

## Esther 9:12

The king said to Queen Esther, “In the citadel of Susa, the Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men and the ten sons of Haman. What have they done in the rest of the king's provinces? Now, what is your petition? It shall be granted to you. And what further request do you have? It shall be done.”

## Esther 9:13

Esther replied, “If it pleases the king, let the Jews in Susa be allowed to carry out today's edict tomorrow also, and let the ten sons of Haman be hanged on gallows.”

## Esther 9:14

So the king commanded that this be done. An edict was issued in Susa, and they hanged the ten sons of Haman.

## Esther 9:15

The Jews in Susa gathered again on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and killed three hundred men in Susa, but they did not lay their hands on the plunder.

---

## Esther 9:16

Meanwhile, the rest of the Jews in the king's provinces assembled to defend themselves and rid themselves of their enemies, killing seventy-five thousand of those who hated them, but they did not lay their hands on the plunder.

## Esther 9:17

This took place on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar, and on the fourteenth day, they rested and made it a day of feasting and joy.

## Esther 9:18

However, the Jews in Susa had assembled on the thirteenth and fourteenth days, and on the fifteenth day, they rested and made it a day of feasting and joy.

## Esther 9:19

Therefore, the Jews of the rural areas, who live in villages, observe the fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a day of joy and feasting, a day for sending gifts of food to one another.

---

## Esther 9:20

Mordecai recorded these events and sent letters to all the Jews throughout the provinces of King Xerxes, both near and far,

## Esther 9:21

to establish among them an annual celebration on the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar

## Esther 9:22

as the time when the Jews got relief from their enemies, and the month when their sorrow was turned into joy and their mourning into a day of celebration. They were to observe them as days of feasting and joy and giving presents of food to one another and gifts to the poor.

## Esther 9:23

So the Jews agreed to continue the celebration they had begun, as Mordecai had written to them.

## Esther 9:24

For Haman, son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the adversary of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them and had cast the pur, that is, the lot, to disturb and destroy them.

## Esther 9:25

But when the matter came to the king's attention, he issued written orders that the wicked scheme Haman had devised against the Jews should return on his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on gallows.

## Esther 9:26

Therefore, these days were called Purim, from the word pur. Because of everything written in this letter and what they had seen and what had happened to them,

## Esther 9:27

the Jews established and made a custom for themselves, their descendants, and all who allied themselves with them, to celebrate these two days every year, in the prescribed manner and at the appointed time.

## Esther 9:28

These days should be remembered and celebrated in every generation, by every family, in every province and every city. And these days of Purim should never cease to be celebrated by the Jews, nor should the memory of them fade from their descendants.

---

## Esther 9:29

Then Queen Esther, daughter of Abihail, along with Mordecai the Jew, wrote with full authority to confirm this second letter about Purim.

## Esther 9:30

And Mordecai sent letters to all the Jews in the 127 provinces of the kingdom of Xerxes, containing words of peace and truth,

## Esther 9:31

to establish these days of Purim at their designated times, as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had decreed for them, and as they had set for themselves and their descendants regarding their times of fasting and lamentation.

## Esther 9:32

The decree of Esther confirmed these regulations about Purim, and it was written down in the records.
