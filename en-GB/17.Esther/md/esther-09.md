# Esther Chapter 9

## Esther 9:1

Now in the twelfth month (that is, the month Adar),  
on the thirteenth day when the king’s command and edict were to be executed,  
on the day when the enemies of the Jews hoped to gain power over them,  
it turned out the opposite occurred,  
so that the Jews themselves gained the upper hand over those who hated them.

## Esther 9:2

The Jews assembled in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus  
to attack those who sought to harm them;  
and no one could stand against them,  
because the dread of them had fallen on all the peoples.

## Esther 9:3

Even all the officials of the provinces, the satraps, the governors,  
and those who handled the king’s business, helped the Jews,  
because the dread of Mordecai had fallen on them.

## Esther 9:4

For Mordecai was great in the king’s palace,  
and his fame spread throughout all the provinces;  
for the man Mordecai became greater and greater.

---

## Esther 9:5

So the Jews struck all their enemies with the sword, killing and destroying;  
and they did as they pleased to those who hated them.

## Esther 9:6

In the citadel of Susa the Jews killed and eliminated five hundred men,

## Esther 9:7

and they killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,

## Esther 9:8

Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,

## Esther 9:9

Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha,

## Esther 9:10

the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews;  
but they did not lay their hands on the plunder.

---

## Esther 9:11

On that day the number of those who were killed in the citadel of Susa was reported to the king.

## Esther 9:12

And the king said to Queen Esther,  
“The Jews have killed and eliminated five hundred men and the ten sons of Haman  
in the citadel of Susa;  
what then have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces!  
Now what is your request? It shall be granted you.  
And what is your further wish? It shall also be done.”

---

## Esther 9:13

Then Esther said,  
“If it pleases the king, let it also be granted to the Jews who are in Susa  
to do tomorrow as they have done today,  
and let the ten sons of Haman be hanged on the gallows.”

## Esther 9:14

So the king commanded that it should be done,  
and an edict was issued in Susa,  
and they hanged the ten sons of Haman.

## Esther 9:15

The Jews who were in Susa assembled again on the fourteenth day of the month Adar,  
and killed three hundred men in Susa,  
but they did not lay their hands on the plunder.

---

## Esther 9:16

Now the rest of the Jews who were in the king’s provinces assembled,  
to defend their lives and rid themselves of their enemies,  
and they killed seventy-five thousand of those who hated them;  
but they did not lay their hands on the plunder.

## Esther 9:17

This was done on the thirteenth day of the month Adar,  
and on the fourteenth day they rested and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing.

---

## Esther 9:18

But the Jews who were in Susa assembled on the thirteenth and the fourteenth of the same month,  
and they rested on the fifteenth day,  
and made it a day of feasting and rejoicing.

---

## Esther 9:19

Therefore the Jews of the rural areas, who live in the rural towns,  
make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a holiday for rejoicing and feasting  
and sending portions of food to one another.

---

## Esther 9:20

Then Mordecai recorded these events,  
and he sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus,  
both near and far,

## Esther 9:21

obliging them to celebrate the fourteenth day of the month Adar,  
and the fifteenth day of the same month, annually,

## Esther 9:22

because on those days the Jews rid themselves of their enemies,  
and it was a month which was turned for them from sorrow into gladness  
and from mourning into a holiday;  
that they were to make them days of feasting and rejoicing,  
and of sending portions of food to one another, and gifts to the poor.

---

## Esther 9:23

So the Jews undertook what they had started to do,  
and what Mordecai had written to them.

## Esther 9:24

For Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews,  
had schemed against the Jews to destroy them,  
and had cast Pur (that is, the lot), to crush and to destroy them.

## Esther 9:25

But when it came to the king’s attention,  
he commanded by letter that his wicked scheme  
which he had devised against the Jews  
was to return on his own head,  
and that he and his sons were to be hanged on the gallows.

## Esther 9:26

Therefore they called these days Purim, after the name Pur.  
And because of the instructions in this letter,  
both what they had seen in this regard and what had happened to them,

## Esther 9:27

the Jews established and made a custom for themselves,  
for their descendants and for all who align themselves with them,  
so that they would not fail to celebrate these two days each year,  
according to their regulation and at their appointed time.

## Esther 9:28

So these days were to be remembered and celebrated  
throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city;  
and these days of Purim were not to be neglected among the Jews,  
nor their memory fade from their descendants.

---

## Esther 9:29

Then Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, with Mordecai the Jew,  
wrote with full authority to confirm this second letter about Purim.

## Esther 9:30

He sent letters to all the Jews,  
to the 127 provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus,  
words of peace and truth,

## Esther 9:31

to establish these days of Purim at their appointed times,  
just as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had established for them,  
and just as they had established for themselves and for their descendants  
with instructions for their times of fasting and their mourning.

## Esther 9:32

The command of Esther established these customs for Purim,  
and it was written in the book.
