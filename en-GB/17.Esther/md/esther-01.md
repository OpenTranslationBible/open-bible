# Esther Chapter 1

## Esther 1:1

In the days of Ahasuerus, the Ahasuerus who reigned over 127 provinces from India to Cush,

## Esther 1:2

during the time when King Ahasuerus was seated on his royal throne in the fortress of Susa,

## Esther 1:3

in the third year of his reign, he held a banquet for all his officials and servants, the military leaders of Persia and Media, the nobles, and the princes of the provinces being present.

## Esther 1:4

He displayed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the splendour of his majesty for many days, 180 days in total.

## Esther 1:5

When these days were completed, the king held a banquet lasting seven days for all the people present in the citadel of Susa, from the greatest to the least, in the courtyard of the garden of the king’s palace.

## Esther 1:6

There were hangings of fine white and blue linen, fastened with cords of fine purple linen to silver rings on marble pillars. The couches were of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl, and other costly stones.

## Esther 1:7

Drinks were served in golden goblets, each different from the other, and the royal wine was abundant in accordance with the king’s generosity.

## Esther 1:8

By the king’s command, there was no compulsion in drinking, for he had instructed all the stewards to serve each man what he desired.

## Esther 1:9

Queen Vashti also held a banquet for the women in the royal palace of King Ahasuerus.

## Esther 1:10

On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Karkas, the seven eunuchs who served in the presence of King Ahasuerus,

## Esther 1:11

to bring Queen Vashti before the king with her royal crown, to show her beauty to the people and the officials, for she was lovely to behold.

## Esther 1:12

But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s command delivered by the eunuchs. Then the king was furious, and his anger burned within him.

## Esther 1:13

Then the king consulted the wise men who understood the times, for it was the custom of the king to speak before all who knew law and justice,

## Esther 1:14

and who were closest to him: Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven nobles of Persia and Media who had access to the king and were highest in the kingdom.

## Esther 1:15

“What shall be done according to the law to Queen Vashti,” he asked, “because she has not carried out the command of King Ahasuerus delivered by the eunuchs?”

## Esther 1:16

Then Memucan replied in the presence of the king and the nobles, “Queen Vashti has wronged not only the king but also all the nobles and the peoples in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus.

## Esther 1:17

For the queen’s behaviour will become known to all women, causing them to look with contempt on their husbands, saying, ‘King Ahasuerus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him, but she did not come.’

## Esther 1:18

This very day the noble women of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen’s conduct will respond in the same way to all the king’s officials, resulting in much contempt and wrath.

## Esther 1:19

If it pleases the king, let a royal decree be issued and recorded in the laws of Persia and Media, which cannot be repealed, that Vashti is never again to enter the presence of King Ahasuerus. Also, let the king give her royal position to another who is better than she.

## Esther 1:20

When the king’s decree is proclaimed throughout his vast kingdom, all women will give honour to their husbands, from the greatest to the least.”

## Esther 1:21

The proposal pleased the king and the princes, and the king did as Memucan proposed.

## Esther 1:22

He sent letters to all the king’s provinces, to each province in its own script and to every people in their own language, declaring that every man should be ruler in his own household and speak according to the language of his people.
