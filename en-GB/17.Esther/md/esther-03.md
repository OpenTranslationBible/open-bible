# Esther Chapter 3

## Esther 3:1

After these events, King Xerxes honoured Haman, son of Hammedatha the Agagite, elevating him and establishing his authority over all the other officials.

## Esther 3:2

All the king’s servants at the king’s gate bowed down and paid homage to Haman, for the king had commanded this concerning him. But Mordecai neither bowed down nor paid him homage.

## Esther 3:3

Then the king’s servants at the king’s gate asked Mordecai, “Why do you disobey the king’s command?”

## Esther 3:4

Day after day they spoke to him, but he refused to listen. Therefore, they reported it to Haman to see whether Mordecai’s reason would be tolerated, for he had informed them that he was a Jew.

## Esther 3:5

When Haman saw that Mordecai neither bowed down nor paid him homage, he was filled with rage.

## Esther 3:6

Having learned who Mordecai’s people were, he deemed it beneath him to kill only Mordecai. Instead, Haman sought to destroy all the Jews, the people of Mordecai, throughout the kingdom of Xerxes.

## Esther 3:7

In the twelfth year of King Xerxes, in the first month, the month of Nisan, the pur (that is, the lot) was cast in Haman’s presence to determine the day and month, and the lot fell on the twelfth month, the month of Adar.

## Esther 3:8

Then Haman said to King Xerxes, “There is a certain people scattered and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom. Their customs are different from all other people, and they do not obey the king’s laws; it is not in the king’s interest to tolerate them.

## Esther 3:9

If it pleases the king, let a decree be issued to destroy them, and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who manage the king’s affairs for the royal treasury.”

## Esther 3:10

The king took his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman, son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews.

## Esther 3:11

The king said to Haman, “Keep the silver, and do with the people as you please.”

## Esther 3:12

On the thirteenth day of the first month, the king’s scribes were summoned, and they wrote out all of Haman’s orders to the king’s satraps, the governors of each province, and the officials of every people, each province in its own script and each people in their own language. These were written in the name of King Xerxes and sealed with his ring.

## Esther 3:13

Dispatches were sent by couriers to all the king’s provinces with orders to destroy, kill, and annihilate all the Jews—young and old, women and children—on a single day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar, and to plunder their goods.

## Esther 3:14

A copy of the edict was to be issued as law in every province and made known to all peoples so that they would be ready for that day.

## Esther 3:15

The couriers went out, hastened by the king’s command, and the decree was issued in the citadel of Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Susa was bewildered.
