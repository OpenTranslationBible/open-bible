# Esther Chapter 4

## Esther 4:1

When Mordecai discovered all that had been done, he tore his clothes, donned sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the centre of the city, wailing loudly and bitterly.

## Esther 4:2

He went as far as the king’s gate, as no one was permitted to enter the king’s gate wearing sackcloth.

## Esther 4:3

In every province where the king’s command and decree reached, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, weeping, and lamentation; many lay in sackcloth and ashes.

## Esther 4:4

When Esther’s eunuchs and female attendants came and informed her about Mordecai, she was seized with great distress. She sent garments for Mordecai to wear in place of his sackcloth, but he refused to accept them.

## Esther 4:5

Then Esther summoned Hathach, one of the king’s eunuchs appointed to attend her, and instructed him to go to Mordecai to learn what was troubling him and why.

## Esther 4:6

Hathach went out to Mordecai in the open square of the city in front of the king’s gate.

## Esther 4:7

Mordecai recounted to him all that had happened to him, including the precise sum of money Haman had promised to deposit into the royal treasury for the destruction of the Jews.

## Esther 4:8

He also handed him a copy of the edict for their annihilation, which had been published in Susa, to show to Esther and to explain it to her, instructing her to go into the king’s presence to seek his favour and plead with him for her people.

## Esther 4:9

Hathach returned and relayed Mordecai’s words to Esther.

## Esther 4:10

Then Esther instructed Hathach to respond to Mordecai:

## Esther 4:11

“All the king’s servants and the people of the king’s provinces know that any man or woman who approaches the king in the inner court without being summoned faces the same law: death, unless the king extends the golden sceptre to them so that they may live. I have not been summoned to come to the king for thirty days.”

## Esther 4:12

Esther’s words were conveyed to Mordecai.

## Esther 4:13

Mordecai sent back this reply to Esther: “Do not think that because you are in the king’s house you alone of all the Jews will escape.

## Esther 4:14

For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from another place, but you and your father’s family will perish. And who knows but that you have attained your royal position for such a time as this?”

---

## Esther 4:15

Then Esther sent this reply to Mordecai:

## Esther 4:16

“Go, gather all the Jews who are in Susa, and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my attendants will fast as you do. After that, I will go to the king, even though it is against the law. And if I perish, I perish.”

## Esther 4:17

So Mordecai went away and did everything as Esther had instructed him.
