# Esther Chapter 8

## Esther 8:1

On that same day, King Ahasuerus gave Queen Esther the estate of Haman, the adversary of the Jews. Mordecai came before the king, as Esther had revealed their relationship.

## Esther 8:2

The king removed his signet ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. Esther then appointed Mordecai over Haman’s estate.

## Esther 8:3

Esther again approached the king, falling at his feet, weeping and pleading with him to stop the evil plan of Haman the Agagite, which he had devised against the Jews.

## Esther 8:4

The king extended the golden sceptre to Esther, and she rose and stood before him.

## Esther 8:5

She said, “If it pleases the king, and if I have found favour in his sight, and if the matter seems right to the king, and I am pleasing in his eyes, let a decree be written to revoke the letters devised by Haman, son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews in all the king’s provinces.

## Esther 8:6

For how can I bear to see the calamity that will befall my people? How can I endure the destruction of my family?”

## Esther 8:7

King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and Mordecai the Jew, “I have given Haman’s estate to Esther, and they have hanged him on the gallows because he laid hands on the Jews.

## Esther 8:8

Now, write another decree in the king’s name on behalf of the Jews as you see fit, and seal it with the king’s signet ring, for no document written in the king’s name and sealed with the king’s ring can be revoked.”

## Esther 8:9

The king’s scribes were summoned at once, on the twenty-third day of the third month, the month of Sivan. They wrote out all Mordecai’s orders to the Jews, and to the satraps, governors, and officials of the 127 provinces stretching from India to Cush. These orders were written in the script of each province and the language of each people, including the Jews in their own script and language.

## Esther 8:10

Mordecai wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus, sealed the letters with the king’s signet ring, and sent them by mounted couriers riding royal horses, bred from swift mares.

## Esther 8:11

The king’s edict granted the Jews in every city the right to assemble and defend themselves, to destroy, kill, and annihilate any armed force of any nationality or province that might attack them, including their women and children, and to plunder their goods.

## Esther 8:12

This was to be done on a single day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar.

## Esther 8:13

A copy of the text of the edict was to be issued as law in each province and made known to all peoples, so that the Jews would be ready on that day to avenge themselves on their enemies.

## Esther 8:14

The couriers, riding the royal relay horses, hurried out, spurred on by the king’s command, and the decree was issued in the citadel of Susa.

## Esther 8:15

Mordecai left the king’s presence wearing royal garments of blue and white, with a large crown of gold and a robe of fine linen and purple. The city of Susa shouted and rejoiced.

## Esther 8:16

For the Jews, it was a time of light, joy, gladness, and honour.

## Esther 8:17

In every province and city where the king’s command and decree reached, there was joy and gladness among the Jews, with feasting and celebrating. Many people of other nationalities became Jews because the fear of the Jews had fallen upon them.
