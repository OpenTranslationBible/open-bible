# Esther Chapter 5

## Esther 5:1

On the third day, Esther donned her royal apparel and stood in the inner courtyard of the king’s palace, facing the entrance to the king’s hall. The king was seated on his royal throne in the throne room, opposite the entrance.

## Esther 5:2

When the king saw Queen Esther standing in the courtyard, she found favour in his eyes; and he extended to her the golden sceptre that was in his hand. Esther approached and touched the top of the sceptre.

The king then asked, “What troubles you, Queen Esther? What is your request? Up to half the kingdom, it shall be granted to you.”

## Esther 5:4

Esther answered, “If it pleases the king, may the king and Haman come today to a banquet I have prepared for him.”

## Esther 5:5

The king said, “Bring Haman quickly so that we may do as Esther desires.” So the king and Haman went to the banquet Esther had prepared.

## Esther 5:6

As they drank wine at the banquet, the king asked Esther, “What is your petition? It will be granted to you. And what is your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it shall be fulfilled.”

## Esther 5:7

Esther replied, “My petition and my request is this:

## Esther 5:8

If I have found favour in the king’s sight, and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and fulfil my request, let the king and Haman come tomorrow to the banquet I will prepare for them. Then I will answer the king’s question.”

## Esther 5:9

Haman left that day joyful and with a glad heart. But when he saw Mordecai at the king’s gate, and noticed that Mordecai neither stood up nor showed fear in his presence, Haman was filled with rage against him.

## Esther 5:10

Nevertheless, Haman restrained himself and went home.

He called together his friends and Zeresh, his wife,

## Esther 5:11

and boasted to them about his great wealth, his many sons, and all the ways the king had honoured him and elevated him above the other officials and servants.

## Esther 5:12

Haman added, “Moreover, Queen Esther invited no one but me to accompany the king to the banquet she prepared. And tomorrow, I am again invited by her along with the king.

## Esther 5:13

Yet all this gives me no satisfaction as long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.”

## Esther 5:14

His wife Zeresh and all his friends suggested, “Have a gallows built, fifty cubits high, and in the morning ask the king to have Mordecai hanged on it. Then go joyfully with the king to the banquet.” This advice pleased Haman, and he had the gallows constructed.
