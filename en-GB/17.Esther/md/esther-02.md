# Esther Chapter 2

## Esther 2:1

After these events, when the anger of King Xerxes had subsided, he remembered Vashti and what she had done, and what had been decreed against her.

## Esther 2:2

Then the king’s attendants who served him suggested, “Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king.

## Esther 2:3

Let the king appoint commissioners in all the provinces of his kingdom to gather all the beautiful young virgins to the citadel of Susa, to the harem, under the supervision of Hegai, the king’s eunuch who is in charge of the women; and let beauty treatments be provided for them.

## Esther 2:4

Then let the young woman who pleases the king be made queen in place of Vashti.” This proposal pleased the king, and he acted accordingly.

## Esther 2:5

Now there was a Jew in the citadel of Susa named Mordecai, son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite,

## Esther 2:6

who had been taken into exile from Jerusalem with the captives who had been deported with Jehoiachin king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken into exile.

## Esther 2:7

Mordecai had a cousin named Hadassah, also known as Esther, whom he had brought up because she had neither father nor mother. This young woman was lovely in form and features, and when her father and mother died, Mordecai adopted her as his own daughter.

## Esther 2:8

When the king’s command and edict had been proclaimed, many young women were brought to the citadel of Susa and placed under the care of Hegai. Esther also was taken to the king’s palace and entrusted to Hegai, who was in charge of the harem.

## Esther 2:9

She pleased him and won his favour. Immediately he provided her with beauty treatments and special food. He assigned to her seven chosen female attendants from the king’s palace and moved her and her attendants to the best place in the harem.

## Esther 2:10

Esther had not revealed her nationality or family background, because Mordecai had instructed her not to do so.

## Esther 2:11

Every day Mordecai walked back and forth near the courtyard of the harem to find out how Esther was and what was happening to her.

## Esther 2:12

Before a young woman’s turn came to go in to King Xerxes, she had to complete twelve months of beauty treatments as prescribed: six months with oil of myrrh and six months with perfumes and cosmetics.

## Esther 2:13

And this is how she would go to the king: anything she desired was given to her to take with her from the harem to the king’s palace.

## Esther 2:14

In the evening she would go in and in the morning return to another part of the harem, under the care of Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch who was in charge of the concubines. She would not return to the king unless he was pleased with her and summoned her by name.

## Esther 2:15

When the turn came for Esther, the daughter of Abihail, the uncle of Mordecai who had adopted her as his daughter, to go in to the king, she requested nothing other than what Hegai, the king’s eunuch in charge of the harem, suggested. And Esther found favour in the eyes of all who saw her.

## Esther 2:16

Esther was taken to King Xerxes in the royal palace in the tenth month, the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.

## Esther 2:17

The king loved Esther more than all the other women, and she found favour and kindness with him more than all the other virgins. So he set a royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti.

## Esther 2:18

Then the king gave a great banquet, Esther’s banquet, for all his nobles and officials. He proclaimed a holiday throughout the provinces and distributed gifts with royal generosity.

## Esther 2:19

When the virgins were gathered together a second time, Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate.

## Esther 2:20

Esther had not revealed her family background or her people, just as Mordecai had instructed her, for she continued to follow Mordecai’s instructions as she had when he was bringing her up.

## Esther 2:21

During the time Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate, Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s officers who guarded the doorway, became angry and conspired to assassinate King Xerxes.

## Esther 2:22

But the plot became known to Mordecai, and he informed Queen Esther, who reported it to the king, giving credit to Mordecai.

## Esther 2:23

When the report was investigated and found to be true, the two officials were hanged on a gallows. All this was recorded in the book of the chronicles in the presence of the king.
