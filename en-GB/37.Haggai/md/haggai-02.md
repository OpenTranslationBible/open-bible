# Haggai Chapter 2

## Haggai 2:1

On the twenty-first of the seventh month, the word of the Lord came by Haggai the prophet, saying,

## Haggai 2:2

> “Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah,  
> And to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest,  
> And to the remnant of the people, saying,

## Haggai 2:3

> ‘Who is left among you who saw this temple in its former glory?  
> And how do you see it now?  
> Does it not seem to you like nothing in comparison?

## Haggai 2:4

> But now take courage, Zerubbabel,’ declares the Lord,  
> ‘Take courage also, Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest,  
> And all you people of the land, take courage,’ declares the Lord,  
> ‘And work; for I am with you,’ declares the Lord of armies.

## Haggai 2:5

> ‘As for the promise which I made you when you came out of Egypt,  
> My Spirit remains in your midst; do not fear!’”

## Haggai 2:6

> For this is what the Lord of armies says:  
> “Once more, in a little while,  
> I am going to shake the heavens and the earth,  
> The sea also and the dry land.

## Haggai 2:7

> And I will shake all the nations;  
> And they will come with the wealth of all nations,  
> And I will fill this house with glory,” says the Lord of armies.

## Haggai 2:8

> “The silver is Mine and the gold is Mine,” declares the Lord of armies.

## Haggai 2:9

> “The latter glory of this house will be greater than the former,” says the Lord of armies,  
> “And in this place I will give peace,” declares the Lord of armies.

## Haggai 2:10

On the twenty-fourth of the ninth month in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to Haggai the prophet, saying,

## Haggai 2:11

> “This is what the Lord of armies says:  
> ‘Ask now the priests for a ruling:

## Haggai 2:12

> If someone carries holy meat in the fold of his garment,  
> And touches bread with this fold, or cooked food, wine, oil, or any other food,  
> Will it become holy?’”  
> And the priests answered, “No.”

## Haggai 2:13

Then Haggai said,

> “If one who is unclean from a corpse touches any of these,  
> Will the latter become unclean?”  
> And the priests answered, “It will become unclean.”

## Haggai 2:14

Then Haggai responded and said,

> “‘So is this people. And so is this nation before Me,’ declares the Lord,  
> ‘And so is every work of their hands; and what they offer there is unclean.

## Haggai 2:15

> But now, do consider from this day onward:  
> Before one stone was placed on another in the temple of the Lord,

## Haggai 2:16

> From that time, when one came to a grain heap of twenty measures,  
> There would be only ten;  
> And when one came to the wine vat to draw fifty measures,  
> There would be only twenty.

## Haggai 2:17

> I struck you with scorching wind, mildew, and hail  
> In all the work of your hands;  
> Yet you did not come back to Me,’ declares the Lord.

## Haggai 2:18

> ‘Do consider from this day onward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month;  
> From the day when the temple of the Lord was founded, consider:

## Haggai 2:19

> Is the seed still in the barn?  
> Even including the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree—  
> It has not produced fruit.  
> Yet from this day on I will bless you.’”

## Haggai 2:20

Then the word of the Lord came a second time to Haggai on the twenty-fourth day of the month, saying,

## Haggai 2:21

> “Speak to Zerubbabel governor of Judah, saying,  
> ‘I am going to shake the heavens and the earth.

## Haggai 2:22

> And I will overthrow the thrones of kingdoms  
> And destroy the power of the kingdoms of the nations;  
> And I will overthrow the chariots and their riders,  
> And the horses and their riders will go down,  
> Every one by the sword of another.’

## Haggai 2:23

> ‘On that day,’ declares the Lord of armies,  
> ‘I will take you, Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, My servant,’ declares the Lord,  
> ‘And I will make you like a signet ring,  
> For I have chosen you,’” declares the Lord of armies.
