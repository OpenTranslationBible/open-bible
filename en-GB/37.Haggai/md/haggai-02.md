# Haggai Chapter 2

## Haggai 2:1

On the twenty-first day of the seventh month, the word of the Lord came through the prophet Haggai, saying,

## Haggai 2:2

> “Speak to Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua,
> son of Jehozadak, the high priest,
> and to the remnant of the people, saying,

## Haggai 2:3

> ‘Who among you is left who saw this house in its former glory?
> How does it appear to you now?
> Does it not seem like nothing in comparison?

## Haggai 2:4

> But now be strong, Zerubbabel,’ declares the Lord.
> ‘Be strong, Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest.
> Be strong, all you people of the land,’ declares the Lord,
> ‘and work; for I am with you,’ declares the Lord of hosts.

## Haggai 2:5

> ‘This is the promise I made to you when you came out of Egypt.
> My Spirit remains among you; do not fear.’

## Haggai 2:6

> For thus says the Lord of hosts:
> ‘In a little while, I will once more
> shake the heavens and the earth,
> the sea and the dry land.

## Haggai 2:7

> I will shake all nations,
> and the treasures of all nations will come,
> and I will fill this house with glory,’ says the Lord of hosts.

## Haggai 2:8

> ‘The silver and the gold belong to me,’ declares the Lord of hosts.

## Haggai 2:9

> ‘The glory of this latter house will be greater than the former,’ says the Lord of hosts.
> ‘And in this place I will grant peace,’ declares the Lord of hosts.”

## Haggai 2:10

On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to Haggai the prophet, saying,

## Haggai 2:11

> “This is what the Lord of hosts says:
> ‘Consult the priests for guidance:

## Haggai 2:12

> If someone carries consecrated meat in the fold of their garment,
> and touches bread, stew, wine, oil, or any other food,
> does it become consecrated?’”

The priests answered, “No.”

## Haggai 2:13

Then Haggai said,

> “If someone defiled by contact with a corpse touches any of these things,
> does it become defiled?”

And the priests answered,

> “Yes, it becomes defiled.”

## Haggai 2:14

Then Haggai said,

> “‘So it is with this people and this nation in my sight,’ declares the Lord.
> ‘Whatever they do and whatever they offer is defiled.

## Haggai 2:15

> Now give careful thought to this from this day onward:
> consider how things were before one stone was laid upon another in the Lord’s temple.

## Haggai 2:16

> When anyone came to a heap expecting twenty measures,
> there were only ten.
> When anyone went to a wine vat to draw fifty measures,
> there were only twenty.

## Haggai 2:17

> I afflicted all the work of your hands
> with blight, mildew, and hail,
> yet you did not return to me,’ declares the Lord.

## Haggai 2:18

> ‘From this day on, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month,
> give careful thought to the day when the foundation of the Lord’s temple was laid.

Consider:

## Haggai 2:19

> Is there any seed left in the barn?
> Until now, the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree
> have not borne fruit.
> But from this day on I will bless you.’”

## Haggai 2:20

The word of the Lord came to Haggai a second time on the twenty-fourth day of the month, saying,

## Haggai 2:21

> “Address Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, with this message:
> ‘I am soon to shake the heavens and the earth.

## Haggai 2:22

> I will overthrow the thrones of kingdoms
> and destroy the power of the kingdoms of the nations.
> I will overthrow chariots and their riders;
> horses and their riders will fall,
> each by the sword of his brother.

## Haggai 2:23

> ‘On that day,’ declares the Lord of hosts,
> ‘I will take you, my servant Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel,’ declares the Lord,
> ‘and I will make you like my signet ring,
> for I have chosen you,’ declares the Lord of hosts.”
