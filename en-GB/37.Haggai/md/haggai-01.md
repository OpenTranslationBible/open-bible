## Haggai 1:1

## Haggai 1:2

“This is what the Lord of Hosts says:

> ‘These people say, “The time has not yet come to rebuild the house of the Lord.”’”

## Haggai 1:3

Then the word of the Lord came through Haggai the prophet, saying,

## Haggai 1:4

> “Is it a time for you to dwell in your panelled houses,
> while this house lies in ruins?”

## Haggai 1:5

Now this is what the Lord of Hosts says:

> “Consider your ways.

## Haggai 1:6

> You have sown much, but harvested little.
> You eat, but never have enough.
> You drink, but never have your fill.
> You clothe yourselves, but no one is warm.
> And he who earns wages does so to put them into a bag with holes.”

## Haggai 1:7

The Lord of Hosts says this:

> “Consider your ways.

## Haggai 1:8

> Go up into the mountains, bring down timber, and build the temple,
> that I may take pleasure in it and be honoured,” says the Lord.

## Haggai 1:9

> “You looked for much, and behold, it came to little;
> and when you brought it home, I blew it away.
> Why?” declares the Lord of Hosts.
> “Because of my house, which remains in ruins,
> while each of you is busy with his own house.

## Haggai 1:10

> Therefore, because of you the heavens have withheld their dew
> and the earth its produce.

## Haggai 1:11

> I called for a drought on the land and the mountains,
> on the grain, the new wine, the oil,
> and on all that the ground produces, on people and livestock,
> and on all the labour of your hands.”
