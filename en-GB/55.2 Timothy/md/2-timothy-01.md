# 2 Timothy Chapter 1

## 2 Timothy 1:1

Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by God's will, in line with the promise of life found in Christ Jesus,

## 2 Timothy 1:2

To Timothy, my beloved son:  
Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

## 2 Timothy 1:3

I thank God, whom I serve with a clear conscience, just as my forefathers did, as I constantly remember you in my prayers both night and day,

## 2 Timothy 1:4

longing to see you, as I recall your tears, so that I may be filled with joy.

## 2 Timothy 1:5

For I am mindful of the sincere faith within you, which first dwelled in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am sure is in you as well.

## 2 Timothy 1:6

For this reason, I remind you to rekindle the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.

## 2 Timothy 1:7

For God has not given us a spirit of fearfulness, but one of power, love, and self-discipline.

## 2 Timothy 1:8

Therefore, do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord, nor of me, His prisoner; but join with me in enduring hardships for the gospel by the power of God,

## 2 Timothy 1:9

who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace, which was granted to us in Christ Jesus from all eternity,

## 2 Timothy 1:10

but now has been revealed by the appearing of our Saviour Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel,

## 2 Timothy 1:11

for which I was appointed as a herald, an apostle, and a teacher.

## 2 Timothy 1:12

For this reason, I also endure these things; yet I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am convinced that He is able to guard what I have entrusted to Him until that day.

## 2 Timothy 1:13

Hold on to the pattern of sound teaching which you have heard from me, in the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.

## 2 Timothy 1:14

Guard, through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us, the treasure that has been entrusted to you.

## 2 Timothy 1:15

You are aware that all who are in Asia turned away from me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes.

## 2 Timothy 1:16

May the Lord show kindness to the household of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and did not shy away from my imprisonment;

## 2 Timothy 1:17

but when he was in Rome, he diligently searched for me and found me—

## 2 Timothy 1:18

may the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord on that day—and you know very well what services he rendered at Ephesus.
