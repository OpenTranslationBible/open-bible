# 2 Timothy Chapter 4

## 2 Timothy 4:1

I earnestly urge you before God and Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom:

## 2 Timothy 4:2

Proclaim the word; be prepared whether the time is favourable or not; correct, rebuke, and encourage, with great patience and careful teaching.

## 2 Timothy 4:3

For the time will come when they will not accept sound doctrine; but desiring to have their ears pleased, they will gather for themselves teachers to suit their own preferences,

## 2 Timothy 4:4

and they will turn away from listening to the truth and will wander off into myths.

## 2 Timothy 4:5

But as for you, exercise self-control in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, complete your ministry.

## 2 Timothy 4:6

For I am already being offered, and the time for my departure is near.

## 2 Timothy 4:7

I have striven to fight the good fight, I have completed the race, I have maintained the faith;

## 2 Timothy 4:8

In the future, there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will bestow on me on that day; and not only to me, but also to all who have longed for His appearing.

## 2 Timothy 4:9

Do your utmost to visit me soon;

## 2 Timothy 4:10

for Demas, having loved this present world, has left me and gone to Thessalonica; Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.

## 2 Timothy 4:11

Only Luke is with me. Take Mark and bring him with you, for he is helpful to me in my work.

## 2 Timothy 4:12

I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.

## 2 Timothy 4:13

When you come, bring the cloak I left at Troas with Carpus, and the books, especially the parchments.

## 2 Timothy 4:14

Alexander the coppersmith caused me much harm; the Lord will repay him according to his actions.

## 2 Timothy 4:15

Be cautious of him yourself too, for he strongly opposed our message.

## 2 Timothy 4:16

At my first defence no one supported me, but all deserted me; may it not be held against them.

## 2 Timothy 4:17

But the Lord stood by me and gave me strength, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and all the Gentiles might hear; and I was delivered from the lionâ€™s mouth.

## 2 Timothy 4:18

The Lord will deliver me from every evil deed, and will bring me safely to His heavenly kingdom; to Him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.

## 2 Timothy 4:19

Extend greetings to Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.

## 2 Timothy 4:20

Erastus stayed at Corinth, but I left Trophimus ill at Miletus.

## 2 Timothy 4:21

Do your best to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers and sisters.

## 2 Timothy 4:22

The Lord be with your spirit.  
Grace be with you.
