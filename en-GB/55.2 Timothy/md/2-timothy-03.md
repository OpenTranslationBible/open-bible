# 2 Timothy Chapter 3

## 2 Timothy 3:1

But realise this, that in the last days difficult times will come.

## 2 Timothy 3:2

For people will be self-centred, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, slanderers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy,

## 2 Timothy 3:3

unloving, irreconcilable, malicious gossips, lacking self-control, brutal, haters of good,

## 2 Timothy 3:4

traitorous, rash, full of themselves, preferring pleasure over devotion to God,

## 2 Timothy 3:5

maintaining an appearance of godliness but denying its power; avoid such people.

## 2 Timothy 3:6

For among them are those who infiltrate households and captivate vulnerable women burdened with sins, led on by various impulses,

## 2 Timothy 3:7

always learning and never able to reach the knowledge of the truth.

## 2 Timothy 3:8

Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also resist the truth, men of corrupt mind, worthless concerning the faith.

## 2 Timothy 3:9

But they will not make further progress, for their foolishness will be evident to all, just as that of Jannes and Jambres also was.

## 2 Timothy 3:10

Now you have followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, perseverance,

## 2 Timothy 3:11

persecutions, and sufferings, such as happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystraâ€”what persecutions I endured, and out of them all the Lord rescued me!

## 2 Timothy 3:12

Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will face persecution.

## 2 Timothy 3:13

But wicked people and impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.

## 2 Timothy 3:14

You, however, continue in the things you have learned and firmly believed, knowing from whom you have learned them,

## 2 Timothy 3:15

and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able to impart the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.

## 2 Timothy 3:16

All Scripture is God-breathed and useful for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness;

## 2 Timothy 3:17

so that the servant of God may be fully capable, equipped for every good work.
