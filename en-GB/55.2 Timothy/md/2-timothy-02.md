# 2 Timothy Chapter 2

## 2 Timothy 2:1

You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.

## 2 Timothy 2:2

What you have heard from me in the company of many witnesses, entrust to reliable individuals who will be able to teach others as well.

## 2 Timothy 2:3

Endure difficulties with me, like a dedicated soldier of Christ Jesus.

## 2 Timothy 2:4

No soldier actively serving gets entangled in the concerns of daily life, so that he may satisfy the one who enlisted him.

## 2 Timothy 2:5

And if someone competes as an athlete, he is not crowned as victor unless he competes according to the rules.

## 2 Timothy 2:6

The diligent farmer should be the first to partake of the harvest.

## 2 Timothy 2:7

Reflect on what I say, and the Lord will grant you insight into all things.

## 2 Timothy 2:8

Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, a descendant of David, as proclaimed in my gospel,

## 2 Timothy 2:9

for which I endure suffering even to the point of imprisonment as a criminal; yet the word of God is not bound.

## 2 Timothy 2:10

For this reason I persevere in all things for the sake of those who are chosen, so that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, along with eternal glory.

## 2 Timothy 2:11

The statement is trustworthy:

> For if we died with Him,
> we will also live with Him;

## 2 Timothy 2:12

> If we endure,
> we will also reign with Him;  
> If we deny Him,
> He also will deny us;

## 2 Timothy 2:13

> If we are faithless,
> He remains faithful,
> for He cannot deny Himself.

## 2 Timothy 2:14

Remind them of these things, and earnestly urge them before God not to argue about words, which is pointless and leads to the downfall of the listeners.

## 2 Timothy 2:15

Make every effort to present yourself approved to God as a worker who does not need to be ashamed, correctly handling the word of truth.

## 2 Timothy 2:16

But avoid irreverent and empty talk, for it will lead to further ungodliness,

## 2 Timothy 2:17

and their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,

## 2 Timothy 2:18

who have strayed from the truth, asserting that the resurrection has already occurred, and they are undermining the faith of some.

## 2 Timothy 2:19

Yet, the solid foundation of God stands firm, bearing this seal: “The Lord knows those who are His;” and, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness.”

## 2 Timothy 2:20

Now in a large house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also vessels of wood and clay, and some are for honour, while others are for dishonour.

## 2 Timothy 2:21

Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from these things, he will be a vessel for honour, sanctified, useful to the Master, prepared for every good work.

## 2 Timothy 2:22

Now flee from youthful desires and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.

## 2 Timothy 2:23

But reject foolish and uninformed debates, knowing that they breed quarrels.

## 2 Timothy 2:24

The Lord’s servant must not be quarrelsome, but be kind to everyone, skilled in teaching, patient when wronged,

## 2 Timothy 2:25

gently correcting those who oppose, if perhaps God may grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth,

## 2 Timothy 2:26

and they may come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, having been held captive by him to do his will.
