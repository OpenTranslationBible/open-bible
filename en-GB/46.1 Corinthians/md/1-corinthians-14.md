# 1 Corinthians Chapter 14

## 1 Corinthians 14:1

Pursue love and earnestly desire spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy.

## 1 Corinthians 14:2

For the one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to people, but to God; for no one understands, but he speaks mysteries in his spirit.

## 1 Corinthians 14:3

But the one who prophesies speaks to people for their strengthening, encouragement, and comfort.

## 1 Corinthians 14:4

The one who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but the one who prophesies edifies the church.

## 1 Corinthians 14:5

Now I wish that you all spoke in tongues, but even more that you would prophesy; greater is the one who prophesies than the one who speaks in tongues, unless someone interprets, so that the church may be built up.

## 1 Corinthians 14:6

But now, brothers and sisters, if I come to you speaking in tongues, how will I benefit you unless I bring you some revelation, knowledge, prophecy, or teaching?

## 1 Corinthians 14:7

Yet even lifeless instruments, whether flute or harp, in producing a sound, if they do not produce a distinction in the tones, how will it be known what is played on the flute or the harp?

## 1 Corinthians 14:8

For if the trumpet gives an unclear sound, who will prepare for battle?

## 1 Corinthians 14:9

So you too, unless you produce intelligible speech with the tongue, how will it be known what is spoken? For you will just be talking to the air.

## 1 Corinthians 14:10

There are, perhaps, a great many kinds of languages in the world, and none is without meaning.

## 1 Corinthians 14:11

So if I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be a foreigner to the one who speaks, and the one who speaks will be a foreigner to me.

## 1 Corinthians 14:12

So you too, since you are eager for spiritual gifts, strive to excel in building up the church.

## 1 Corinthians 14:13

Therefore, one who speaks in a tongue should pray that they may interpret.

## 1 Corinthians 14:14

For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unproductive.

## 1 Corinthians 14:15

What is the outcome then? I will pray with the spirit, but I will also pray with the mind; I will sing with the spirit, and I will also sing with the mind.

## 1 Corinthians 14:16

For otherwise, if you bless God in the spirit only, how will the one who occupies the place of the outsider say the “Amen” at your giving of thanks, since he does not understand what you are saying?

## 1 Corinthians 14:17

For you are giving thanks well enough, but the other person is not built up.

## 1 Corinthians 14:18

I am grateful to God that I speak in tongues more than all of you;

## 1 Corinthians 14:19

Yet, in the church, I would rather speak five words with understanding, to instruct others as well, than ten thousand words in a tongue.

## 1 Corinthians 14:20

Brothers and sisters, do not be children in your thinking; in regard to evil be infants, but in your thinking be mature.

## 1 Corinthians 14:21

In the Law it is written:

> “By people of strange tongues
> and by the lips of foreigners
> I will speak to this people,
> and not even then will they listen to Me,”
> says the Lord.

## 1 Corinthians 14:22

So then, tongues are a sign, not for those who believe but for unbelievers; but prophecy is not for unbelievers but for those who believe.

## 1 Corinthians 14:23

Therefore if the whole church gathers together and everyone speaks in tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are out of your mind?

## 1 Corinthians 14:24

But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or outsider enters, he is convicted by all, he is called to account by all;

## 1 Corinthians 14:25

The secrets of his heart are revealed; and so he will fall on his face and worship God, declaring that God is truly among you.

## 1 Corinthians 14:26

What is the outcome then, brothers and sisters? When you assemble, each one has a psalm, a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, an interpretation. All things are to be done for building up.

## 1 Corinthians 14:27

If anyone speaks in a tongue, it should be by two or at most three, and each in turn, and someone must interpret;

## 1 Corinthians 14:28

But if there is no interpreter, they should remain silent in the church, and speak to themselves and to God.

## 1 Corinthians 14:29

Have two or three prophets speak, and let the others evaluate.

## 1 Corinthians 14:30

But if a revelation is made to another who is seated, the first one should remain silent.

## 1 Corinthians 14:31

For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all may be encouraged;

## 1 Corinthians 14:32

And the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets;

## 1 Corinthians 14:33

For God is not a God of confusion, but of peace. As in all the churches of the saints,

## 1 Corinthians 14:34

The women should remain silent in the churches; for they are not permitted to speak, but should be in submission, as the Law also says.

## 1 Corinthians 14:35

If they wish to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is improper for a woman to speak in church.

## 1 Corinthians 14:36

Or did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only ones it has reached?

## 1 Corinthians 14:37

If anyone considers themselves a prophet or spiritual, they should acknowledge that what I write to you is the Lord’s command.

## 1 Corinthians 14:38

But if anyone does not recognise this, they are not recognised.

## 1 Corinthians 14:39

Therefore, my brothers and sisters, eagerly desire to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues.

## 1 Corinthians 14:40

But everything should be conducted in a proper and orderly manner.
