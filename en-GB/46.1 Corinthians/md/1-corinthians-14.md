# 1 Corinthians Chapter 14

## 1 Corinthians 14:1

Pursue love, yet desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy.

## 1 Corinthians 14:2

For the one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to people, but to God; for no one understands, but in his spirit he speaks mysteries.

## 1 Corinthians 14:3

But the one who prophesies speaks to people for edification, exhortation, and consolation.

## 1 Corinthians 14:4

The one who speaks in a tongue edifies himself; but the one who prophesies edifies the church.

## 1 Corinthians 14:5

Now I wish that you all spoke in tongues, but rather that you would prophesy; and greater is the one who prophesies than the one who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, so that the church may receive edification.

## 1 Corinthians 14:6

But now, brothers and sisters, if I come to you speaking in tongues, how will I benefit you unless I speak to you either by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophecy, or of teaching?

## 1 Corinthians 14:7

Yet even lifeless instruments, whether flute or harp, in producing a sound, if they do not produce a distinction in the tones, how will it be known what is played on the flute or the harp?

## 1 Corinthians 14:8

For if the trumpet produces an indistinct sound, who will prepare himself for battle?

## 1 Corinthians 14:9

So you too, unless you produce intelligible speech with the tongue, how will it be known what is spoken? For you will just be talking to the air.

## 1 Corinthians 14:10

There are, perhaps, a great many kinds of languages in the world, and none is without meaning.

## 1 Corinthians 14:11

So if I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be a foreigner to the one who speaks, and the one who speaks will be a foreigner to me.

## 1 Corinthians 14:12

So you too, since you are eager to possess spiritual gifts, strive to excel for the edification of the church.

## 1 Corinthians 14:13

Therefore, one who speaks in a tongue is to pray that he may interpret.

## 1 Corinthians 14:14

For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unproductive.

## 1 Corinthians 14:15

What is the outcome then? I will pray with the spirit, but I will also pray with the mind; I will sing with the spirit, and I will also sing with the mind.

## 1 Corinthians 14:16

For otherwise, if you bless God in the spirit only, how will the one who occupies the place of the outsider say the “Amen” at your giving of thanks, since he does not understand what you are saying?

## 1 Corinthians 14:17

For you are giving thanks well enough, but the other person is not edified.

## 1 Corinthians 14:18

I thank God that I speak in tongues more than you all;

## 1 Corinthians 14:19

Nevertheless, in church I prefer to speak five words with my mind so that I may instruct others also, rather than ten thousand words in a tongue.

## 1 Corinthians 14:20

Brothers and sisters, do not be children in your thinking; yet in evil be infants, but in your thinking be mature.

## 1 Corinthians 14:21

In the Law it is written:

> “By people of strange tongues
> and by the lips of foreigners
> I will speak to this people,
> and not even then will they listen to Me,”
> says the Lord.

## 1 Corinthians 14:22

So then, tongues are a sign, not for those who believe but for unbelievers; but prophecy is not for unbelievers but for those who believe.

## 1 Corinthians 14:23

Therefore if the whole church gathers together and all the people speak in tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are insane?

## 1 Corinthians 14:24

But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or outsider enters, he is convicted by all, he is called to account by all;

## 1 Corinthians 14:25

The secrets of his heart are disclosed; and so he will fall on his face and worship God, declaring that God is certainly among you.

## 1 Corinthians 14:26

What is the outcome then, brothers and sisters? When you assemble, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. All things are to be done for edification.

## 1 Corinthians 14:27

If anyone speaks in a tongue, it must be by two or at most three, and each one in turn, and one is to interpret;

## 1 Corinthians 14:28

But if there is no interpreter, he is to keep silent in church, and have him speak to himself and to God.

## 1 Corinthians 14:29

Have two or three prophets speak, and have the others pass judgement.

## 1 Corinthians 14:30

But if a revelation is made to another who is seated, then the first one is to keep silent.

## 1 Corinthians 14:31

For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all may be exhorted;

## 1 Corinthians 14:32

And the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets;

## 1 Corinthians 14:33

For God is not a God of confusion, but of peace. As in all the churches of the saints,

## 1 Corinthians 14:34

The women are to keep silent in the churches; for they are not permitted to speak, but are to subject themselves, just as the Law also says.

## 1 Corinthians 14:35

If they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is improper for a woman to speak in church.

## 1 Corinthians 14:36

Or was it from you that the word of God first went out? Or has it come to you only?

## 1 Corinthians 14:37

If anyone thinks that he is a prophet or spiritual, he is to recognise that the things which I write to you are the Lord’s commandment.

## 1 Corinthians 14:38

But if anyone does not recognise this, he is not recognised.

## 1 Corinthians 14:39

Therefore, my brothers and sisters, earnestly desire to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues.

## 1 Corinthians 14:40

But all things must be done properly and in an orderly way.
