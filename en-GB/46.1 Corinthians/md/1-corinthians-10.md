# 1 Corinthians Chapter 10

## 1 Corinthians 10:1

For I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that our fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea;

## 1 Corinthians 10:2

And they all were baptised into Moses in the cloud and in the sea;

## 1 Corinthians 10:3

And they all partook of the same spiritual nourishment,

## 1 Corinthians 10:4

And all drank the same spiritual drink, for they were drinking from a spiritual rock that accompanied them; and that rock was Christ.

## 1 Corinthians 10:5

Yet, with most of them, God was not pleased; their bodies were scattered in the wilderness.

## 1 Corinthians 10:6

Now these events occurred as examples for us, so that we would not desire harmful things as they did.

## 1 Corinthians 10:7

Do not become idolaters, as some of them were; as it is written: “The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to revel.”

## 1 Corinthians 10:8

Nor should we engage in immorality, as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in one day.

## 1 Corinthians 10:9

Nor should we test the Lord, as some of them did, and were destroyed by serpents.

## 1 Corinthians 10:10

Nor should we complain, as some of them did, and were destroyed by the destroyer.

## 1 Corinthians 10:11

These things happened to them as a warning, and they were recorded for our instruction, upon whom the culmination of the ages has come.

## 1 Corinthians 10:12

Therefore, let anyone who thinks they stand take heed lest they fall.

## 1 Corinthians 10:13

No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to man; and God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation will also provide a way out, so that you can endure it.

## 1 Corinthians 10:14

Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.

## 1 Corinthians 10:15

I speak as to sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say.

## 1 Corinthians 10:16

Is not the cup of blessing that we bless a participation in the blood of Christ? Is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ?

## 1 Corinthians 10:17

Because there is one loaf, we who are many are one body; for we all partake of the one loaf.

## 1 Corinthians 10:18

Reflect on the people of Israel; are not those who eat the sacrifices sharers in the altar?

## 1 Corinthians 10:19

What am I implying then? That food offered to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?

## 1 Corinthians 10:20

No, but I say that what the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God; and I do not want you to be participants with demons.

## 1 Corinthians 10:21

You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons; you cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons.

## 1 Corinthians 10:22

Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? We are not stronger than He, are we?

## 1 Corinthians 10:23

“All things are permissible,” but not all things are beneficial. “All things are permissible,” but not all things build up.

## 1 Corinthians 10:24

Let no one seek their own good, but rather that of their neighbour.

## 1 Corinthians 10:25

Consume whatever is sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience;

## 1 Corinthians 10:26

For the earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it.

## 1 Corinthians 10:27

If an unbeliever invites you and you wish to go, eat whatever is set before you without raising questions of conscience.

## 1 Corinthians 10:28

However, if someone tells you, “This has been offered in sacrifice,” then do not eat it, for the sake of the one who informed you, and for the sake of conscience;

## 1 Corinthians 10:29

I do not mean your own conscience, but the other person’s; for why should my freedom be judged by another’s conscience?

## 1 Corinthians 10:30

If I partake with gratitude, why am I criticised for something I give thanks for?

## 1 Corinthians 10:31

So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do everything for the glory of God.

## 1 Corinthians 10:32

Give no offence to Jews or Greeks, or to the church of God;

## 1 Corinthians 10:33

Just as I try to please everyone in all things, not seeking my own advantage but that of many, so that they may be saved.
