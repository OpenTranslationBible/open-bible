# 1 Corinthians Chapter 4

## 1 Corinthians 4:1

This is how one should regard us: as servants of Christ and caretakers of the mysteries of God.

## 1 Corinthians 4:2

In this regard, it is expected of caretakers that they be found faithful.

## 1 Corinthians 4:3

But to me it is of little importance that I am judged by you, or by any human court; indeed, I do not even judge myself.

## 1 Corinthians 4:4

For I am not conscious of anything against myself; however, this does not justify me, but the one who judges me is the Lord.

## 1 Corinthians 4:5

Therefore do not continue passing judgement before the time, but wait until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the things hidden in the darkness and disclose the motives of human hearts; and then praise will come to each person from God.

## 1 Corinthians 4:6

Now these things, brothers and sisters, I have figuratively applied to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that in us you may learn not to exceed what is written, so that no one of you will become arrogant in favour of one against another.

## 1 Corinthians 4:7

For who considers you as superior? And what do you have that you did not receive? But if you did receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?

## 1 Corinthians 4:8

You are already satisfied, you have already become wealthy, you have become rulers without us; and indeed, I wish that you had become rulers so that we also might reign with you.

## 1 Corinthians 4:9

For, I think, God has displayed us, the apostles, last of all, as those destined to die, because we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to humanity.

## 1 Corinthians 4:10

We are fools for the sake of Christ, but you are wise in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are honoured, but we are without honour.

## 1 Corinthians 4:11

Up to this present moment we are both hungry and thirsty, and are poorly clothed, mistreated, and homeless;

## 1 Corinthians 4:12

And we labour, working with our own hands; when we are verbally abused, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure it;

## 1 Corinthians 4:13

When we are slandered, we respond as friends; we have become like the refuse of the world, the dregs of all things, even until now.

## 1 Corinthians 4:14

I do not write these things to embarrass you, but to advise you as my beloved children.

## 1 Corinthians 4:15

For if you were to have countless guides in Christ, yet you would not have many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.

## 1 Corinthians 4:16

Therefore I encourage you, be imitators of me.

## 1 Corinthians 4:17

For this reason I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, and he will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, just as I teach everywhere in every church.

## 1 Corinthians 4:18

Now some have become conceited, as though I were not coming to you.

## 1 Corinthians 4:19

But I will come to you soon, if the Lord allows, and I shall find out, not the words of those who are conceited, but their power.

## 1 Corinthians 4:20

For the kingdom of God is not about mere words, but is demonstrated through power.

## 1 Corinthians 4:21

What do you prefer? That I come to you with a rod, or with love and a spirit of gentleness?
