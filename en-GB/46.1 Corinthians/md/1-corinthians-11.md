# 1 Corinthians Chapter 11

## 1 Corinthians 11:1

Be imitators of me, just as I also am of Christ.

## 1 Corinthians 11:2

Now I praise you because you remember me in everything, and hold firmly to the traditions, just as I delivered them to you.

## 1 Corinthians 11:3

But I want you to understand that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of a woman, and God is the head of Christ.

## 1 Corinthians 11:4

Every man who has something on his head while praying or prophesying disgraces his head.

## 1 Corinthians 11:5

But every woman who has her head uncovered while praying or prophesying disgraces her head, for she is one and the same as the woman whose head is shaved.

## 1 Corinthians 11:6

For if a woman does not cover her head, have her also cut off her hair; but if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, have her cover her head.

## 1 Corinthians 11:7

For a man should not have his head covered, since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man.

## 1 Corinthians 11:8

For man does not originate from woman, but woman from man;

## 1 Corinthians 11:9

For indeed man was not created for the woman’s sake, but woman for the man’s sake.

## 1 Corinthians 11:10

Therefore the woman should have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels.

## 1 Corinthians 11:11

However, in the Lord, neither is woman independent of man, nor is man independent of woman.

## 1 Corinthians 11:12

For as the woman originates from the man, so also the man has his birth through the woman; and all things originate from God.

## 1 Corinthians 11:13

Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?

## 1 Corinthians 11:14

Does even nature itself not teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonour to him,

## 1 Corinthians 11:15

But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her? For her hair is given to her as a covering.

## 1 Corinthians 11:16

But if anyone is inclined to be contentious, we have no such practice, nor have the churches of God.

## 1 Corinthians 11:17

Now in giving this next instruction I do not praise you, because you come together not for the better but for the worse.

## 1 Corinthians 11:18

For, in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and in part I believe it.

## 1 Corinthians 11:19

For there also have to be factions among you, so that those who are approved may become evident among you.

## 1 Corinthians 11:20

Therefore when you come together, it is not to eat the Lord’s Supper,

## 1 Corinthians 11:21

For when you eat, each one takes his own supper first; and one goes hungry while another gets drunk.

## 1 Corinthians 11:22

What! Do you not have houses in which to eat and drink? Or do you despise the church of God and shame those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? In this I do not praise you.

## 1 Corinthians 11:23

For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus, on the night when He was betrayed, took bread;

## 1 Corinthians 11:24

And when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, “This is My body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of Me.”

## 1 Corinthians 11:25

In the same way He also took the cup after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.”

## 1 Corinthians 11:26

For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes.

## 1 Corinthians 11:27

Therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy way shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.

## 1 Corinthians 11:28

But a person must examine himself, and in so doing he is to eat of the bread and drink of the cup.

## 1 Corinthians 11:29

For the one who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgement to himself if he does not properly recognise the body.

## 1 Corinthians 11:30

For this reason many among you are weak and sick, and a number are asleep.

## 1 Corinthians 11:31

But if we judged ourselves rightly, we would not be judged.

## 1 Corinthians 11:32

But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord so that we will not be condemned along with the world.

## 1 Corinthians 11:33

So then, my brothers and sisters, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.

## 1 Corinthians 11:34

If anyone is hungry, have him eat at home, so that you do not come together for judgement. As to the remaining matters, I will give instructions when I come.
