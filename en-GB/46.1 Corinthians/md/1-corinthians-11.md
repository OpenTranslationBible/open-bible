# 1 Corinthians Chapter 11

## 1 Corinthians 11:1

Imitate me therefore, just as I imitate Christ.

## 1 Corinthians 11:2

I commend you for remembering me in all things and for holding firmly to the traditions as I passed them on to you.

## 1 Corinthians 11:3

I wish for you to understand that Christ is the leader of every man, the man is the leader of a woman, and God is the leader of Christ.

## 1 Corinthians 11:4

Any man who covers his head while praying or prophesying brings dishonour to his head.

## 1 Corinthians 11:5

But any woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered brings dishonour to her head, for she is like one whose head is shaved.

## 1 Corinthians 11:6

For if a woman does not cover her head, she should also cut off her hair; but if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, she should cover her head.

## 1 Corinthians 11:7

A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man.

## 1 Corinthians 11:8

For man does not come from woman, but woman comes from man;

## 1 Corinthians 11:9

For indeed man was not created for the benefit of woman, but woman for the benefit of man.

## 1 Corinthians 11:10

Therefore, a woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head, because of the angels.

## 1 Corinthians 11:11

However, in the Lord, woman is not separate from man, nor is man separate from woman.

## 1 Corinthians 11:12

For just as the woman comes from the man, so also the man is born through the woman; and all things come from God.

## 1 Corinthians 11:13

Consider this for yourself: is it appropriate for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?

## 1 Corinthians 11:14

Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonour to him,

## 1 Corinthians 11:15

but if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For her hair is given to her as a covering.

## 1 Corinthians 11:16

But if anyone wishes to be argumentative, we have no other practice, nor do the churches of God.

## 1 Corinthians 11:17

In giving this next instruction, I cannot commend you, because your gatherings do more harm than good.

## 1 Corinthians 11:18

To begin with, when you come together as a church, I hear that there are divisions among you; and to some extent, I believe it.

## 1 Corinthians 11:19

Indeed, there must be differences among you to show which of you have God's approval.

## 1 Corinthians 11:20

When you gather together, it is not truly to eat the Lord’s Supper,

## 1 Corinthians 11:21

for when you eat, each one goes ahead with their own meal; one remains hungry while another becomes drunk.

## 1 Corinthians 11:22

What! Do you not have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I commend you? In this matter, I do not commend you.

## 1 Corinthians 11:23

For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: that the Lord Jesus, on the night He was betrayed, took bread;

## 1 Corinthians 11:24

And after giving thanks, He broke it and said, “This is My body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of Me.”

## 1 Corinthians 11:25

Similarly, after the meal, He took the cup, saying, “This cup represents the new covenant in My blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of Me.”

## 1 Corinthians 11:26

For every time you eat this bread and drink from this cup, you announce the Lord’s death until He returns.

## 1 Corinthians 11:27

Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord.

## 1 Corinthians 11:28

Each person should reflect on themselves before they partake of the bread and drink from the cup.

## 1 Corinthians 11:29

For those who eat and drink without discerning the body of Christ eat and drink judgement on themselves.

## 1 Corinthians 11:30

This is the reason many among you are weak and ill, and several have passed away.

## 1 Corinthians 11:31

But if we were more discerning with regard to ourselves, we would not come under such judgement.

## 1 Corinthians 11:32

Yet, when we are judged in this manner by the Lord, we are being corrected so that we will not be finally condemned with the world.

## 1 Corinthians 11:33

Therefore, my brothers and sisters, when you gather to eat, you should all partake together.

## 1 Corinthians 11:34

If anyone is hungry, they should eat at home, so that when you meet together it may not result in judgement. And when I come, I will give further directions.
