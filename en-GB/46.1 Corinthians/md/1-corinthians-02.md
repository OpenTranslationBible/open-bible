# 1 Corinthians Chapter 2

## 1 Corinthians 2:1

When I came to you, brothers and sisters, I did not arrive with superior speaking skills or wisdom, as I shared with you the testimony of God.

## 1 Corinthians 2:2

For I decided to focus on nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and Him crucified.

## 1 Corinthians 2:3

I also was with you in weakness, and fear, and in much trembling,

## 1 Corinthians 2:4

And my message and my preaching were not with persuasive words of wisdom, but with a demonstration of the Spirit and of power,

## 1 Corinthians 2:5

So that your faith would not rely on human wisdom, but on the power of God.

## 1 Corinthians 2:6

Yet we do speak wisdom among those who are mature—a wisdom, however, not of this age nor of the rulers of this age, who are passing away;

## 1 Corinthians 2:7

But we speak of God’s wisdom in a mystery, the hidden wisdom which God determined before the ages for our glory;

## 1 Corinthians 2:8

This wisdom was not understood by any of the rulers of this age; for if they had comprehended it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.

## 1 Corinthians 2:9

But just as it is written:

> “Things which the eye has not seen and the ear has not heard,  
> And which have not been conceived in the human heart,  
> Are all that God has prepared for those who love Him.”

## 1 Corinthians 2:10

For God revealed these things to us through the Spirit; for the Spirit explores all things, even the depths of God.

## 1 Corinthians 2:11

For who among people knows the thoughts of a person except the spirit of the person within? In the same way, the thoughts of God are known by no one except the Spirit of God.

## 1 Corinthians 2:12

Now we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may understand the things freely given to us by God.

## 1 Corinthians 2:13

We also express these things, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, uniting spiritual thoughts with spiritual words.

## 1 Corinthians 2:14

But a natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they seem foolish to him; and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.

## 1 Corinthians 2:15

But the one who is spiritual evaluates all things, yet he himself is evaluated by no one.

## 1 Corinthians 2:16

For

> who has known the mind of the Lord, that he will instruct Him?

But we have the mind of Christ.
