# 1 Corinthians Chapter 16

## 1 Corinthians 16:1

Regarding the collection for the believers, as I instructed the churches of Galatia, you should do likewise.

## 1 Corinthians 16:2

On the first day of every week, each of you is to set aside and save, as he may prosper, so that no collections need to be made when I come.

## 1 Corinthians 16:3

When I arrive, those whom you approve, I will send with letters to deliver your gift to Jerusalem;

## 1 Corinthians 16:4

And if it seems suitable for me to go also, they will accompany me.

## 1 Corinthians 16:5

I will come to you after passing through Macedonia, for I am travelling through Macedonia;

## 1 Corinthians 16:6

And it is possible that I will stay with you, or even spend the winter, so that you may assist me on my journey, wherever I go.

## 1 Corinthians 16:7

For I do not wish to see you now only briefly; I hope to remain with you for some time, if the Lord allows.

## 1 Corinthians 16:8

However, I plan to remain in Ephesus until Pentecost;

## 1 Corinthians 16:9

For a great opportunity for effective work has opened to me, and there are many opponents.

## 1 Corinthians 16:10

Now if Timothy comes, ensure that he has nothing to fear while he is with you, for he is doing the Lordâ€™s work, as I also am.

## 1 Corinthians 16:11

So do not look down on him. But send him on his way in peace, so that he may come to me; for I expect him with the brothers.

## 1 Corinthians 16:12

Now concerning our brother Apollos, I strongly encouraged him to come to you with the brothers; and it was not at all his desire to come now, but he will come when he has opportunity.

## 1 Corinthians 16:13

Be watchful, stand firm in the faith, be courageous, be strong.

## 1 Corinthians 16:14

Ensure everything you do is done in love.

## 1 Corinthians 16:15

Now I urge you, brothers and sisters: you know the household of Stephanas, that they are the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints,

## 1 Corinthians 16:16

That you also be in subjection to such people and to everyone who helps in the work and labours.

## 1 Corinthians 16:17

I am glad about the arrival of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus, because they have supplied what was lacking on your part.

## 1 Corinthians 16:18

For they have refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore, recognise such individuals.

## 1 Corinthians 16:19

The churches of Asia send you greetings. Aquila and Prisca warmly greet you in the Lord, along with the church that meets in their house.

## 1 Corinthians 16:20

All the believers send you greetings. Embrace one another with a holy kiss.

## 1 Corinthians 16:21

See this greeting is written by me, Paul, by my own hand.

## 1 Corinthians 16:22

If anyone does not love the Lord, let them be under a curse. Maranatha!

## 1 Corinthians 16:23

May the grace of the Lord Jesus remain with you.

## 1 Corinthians 16:24

My love is with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
