# 1 Corinthians Chapter 12

## 1 Corinthians 12:1

Now, regarding spiritual gifts, dear friends, I do not want you to be uninformed.

## 1 Corinthians 12:2

You are aware that when you were non-believers, you were misled to the silent idols, however you were guided.

## 1 Corinthians 12:3

Therefore, I declare to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus is cursed,” and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit.

## 1 Corinthians 12:4

Now there are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit.

## 1 Corinthians 12:5

And there are different kinds of ministries, but the same Lord.

## 1 Corinthians 12:6

There are different kinds of workings, but it is the same God who accomplishes all things in everyone.

## 1 Corinthians 12:7

But to each person is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the benefit of all.

## 1 Corinthians 12:8

For to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, and to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;

## 1 Corinthians 12:9

To another, faith through the same Spirit; and to another, gifts of healing through the one Spirit,

## 1 Corinthians 12:10

And to another the working of miracles, and to another prophecy, and to another the discernment of spirits, to another various kinds of languages, and to another the interpretation of languages.

## 1 Corinthians 12:11

But one and the same Spirit is active in all these, distributing to each person individually as He chooses.

## 1 Corinthians 12:12

For just as the body is one and has many parts, and all the parts of the body, though numerous, are one body, so also is Christ.

## 1 Corinthians 12:13

For by one Spirit we were all baptised into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to partake of one Spirit.

## 1 Corinthians 12:14

For the body is not composed of one part, but of many.

## 1 Corinthians 12:15

If the foot says, “Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,” it is not for this reason any less a part of the body.

## 1 Corinthians 12:16

And if the ear says, “Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,” it is not for this reason any less a part of the body.

## 1 Corinthians 12:17

If the whole body were an eye, what would happen to the hearing? If the whole were hearing, what would become of the sense of smell?

## 1 Corinthians 12:18

But now God has placed the parts, each one of them in the body, just as He intended.

## 1 Corinthians 12:19

If all were a single part, where would the body be?

## 1 Corinthians 12:20

Yet, as it stands, there are many parts, but one body.

## 1 Corinthians 12:21

And the eye cannot say to the hand, “I do not need you”; nor again can the head say to the feet, “I do not need you.”

## 1 Corinthians 12:22

On the contrary, it is much more the case that the parts of the body which seem to be weaker are indispensable;

## 1 Corinthians 12:23

And those parts of the body which we consider less honourable, on these we bestow greater honour, and our less presentable parts are treated with greater decorum,

## 1 Corinthians 12:24

Whereas our more presentable parts have no need of it. But God has so composed the body, giving more abundant honour to that part which lacked,

## 1 Corinthians 12:25

So that there may be no division in the body, but that the parts may have equal concern for one another.

## 1 Corinthians 12:26

And if one part of the body suffers, all the parts suffer with it; if a part is honoured, all the parts rejoice with it.

## 1 Corinthians 12:27

Now you are the body of Christ, and individually parts of it.

## 1 Corinthians 12:28

And God has appointed in the church, first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, and various kinds of languages.

## 1 Corinthians 12:29

All are not apostles, are they? All are not prophets, are they? All are not teachers? All are not workers of miracles?

## 1 Corinthians 12:30

Not all have gifts of healing, do they? Not all speak in languages, do they? Not all interpret, do they?

## 1 Corinthians 12:31

But earnestly desire the greater gifts. And yet, I am going to show you a much better way.
