# 1 Corinthians Chapter 15

## 1 Corinthians 15:1

Now I make known to you, brothers and sisters, the gospel which I preached to you, which you also received, in which you also stand,

## 1 Corinthians 15:2

By which you also are saved, if you hold firmly to the word which I preached to you, unless you believed in vain.

## 1 Corinthians 15:3

For I handed down to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,

## 1 Corinthians 15:4

And that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,

## 1 Corinthians 15:5

And that He appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.

## 1 Corinthians 15:6

After that, He appeared to more than five hundred brothers and sisters at one time, most of whom remain until now, but some have fallen asleep.

## 1 Corinthians 15:7

Then He appeared to James, then to all the apostles;

## 1 Corinthians 15:8

And last of all, as to one untimely born, He appeared to me also.

## 1 Corinthians 15:9

For I am the least of the apostles, and not fit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.

## 1 Corinthians 15:10

But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me did not prove vain; but I laboured even more than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God with me.

## 1 Corinthians 15:11

Whether then it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed.

## 1 Corinthians 15:12

Now if Christ is preached, that He has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?

## 1 Corinthians 15:13

But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised;

## 1 Corinthians 15:14

And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain, your faith also is in vain.

## 1 Corinthians 15:15

Moreover, we are even found to be false witnesses of God, because we testified against God that He raised Christ, whom He did not raise, if in fact the dead are not raised.

## 1 Corinthians 15:16

For if the dead are not raised, then not even Christ has been raised;

## 1 Corinthians 15:17

And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless; you are still in your sins.

## 1 Corinthians 15:18

Then also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.

## 1 Corinthians 15:19

If we have hoped in Christ only in this life, we are of all people most to be pitied.

## 1 Corinthians 15:20

But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who are asleep.

## 1 Corinthians 15:21

For since by a man death came, by a man also came the resurrection of the dead.

## 1 Corinthians 15:22

For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.

## 1 Corinthians 15:23

But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, after that those who are Christ’s at His coming,

## 1 Corinthians 15:24

Then comes the end, when He hands over the kingdom to our God and Father, when He has abolished all rule and all authority and power.

## 1 Corinthians 15:25

For He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet.

## 1 Corinthians 15:26

The last enemy that will be abolished is death.

## 1 Corinthians 15:27

For He has put all things in subjection under His feet. But when He says, “All things are put in subjection,” it is clear that this excludes the One who put all things in subjection to Him.

## 1 Corinthians 15:28

When all things are subjected to Him, then the Son Himself will also be subjected to the One who subjected all things to Him, so that God may be all in all.

## 1 Corinthians 15:29

For otherwise, what will those do who are baptised for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why then are they baptised for them?

## 1 Corinthians 15:30

Why are we also in danger every hour?

## 1 Corinthians 15:31

I affirm, brothers and sisters, by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, that I die daily.

## 1 Corinthians 15:32

If from human motives I fought with wild beasts at Ephesus, what good is it to me? If the dead are not raised,

> “Let’s eat and drink,
> for tomorrow we die.”

## 1 Corinthians 15:33

Do not be deceived: “Bad company corrupts good morals.”

## 1 Corinthians 15:34

Sober up morally and stop sinning, for some have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame.

## 1 Corinthians 15:35

But someone will say, “How are the dead raised? And with what kind of body do they come?”

## 1 Corinthians 15:36

You fool! That which you sow does not come to life unless it dies;

## 1 Corinthians 15:37

And that which you sow, you do not sow the body which is to be, but a bare grain, perhaps of wheat or something else.

## 1 Corinthians 15:38

But God gives it a body just as He wished, and to each of the seeds a body of its own.

## 1 Corinthians 15:39

All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one flesh of mankind, another flesh of animals, another of birds, and another of fish.

## 1 Corinthians 15:40

There are also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the glory of the heavenly is one, and the glory of the earthly is another.

## 1 Corinthians 15:41

There is one glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.

## 1 Corinthians 15:42

So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown a perishable body, it is raised an imperishable body;

## 1 Corinthians 15:43

It is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;

## 1 Corinthians 15:44

It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.

## 1 Corinthians 15:45

So also it is written: “The first man, Adam, became a living person.” The last Adam became a life-giving spirit.

## 1 Corinthians 15:46

However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural; then the spiritual.

## 1 Corinthians 15:47

The first man is from the earth, earthy; the second man is from heaven.

## 1 Corinthians 15:48

As is the earthy one, so also are those who are earthy; and as is the heavenly one, so also are those who are heavenly.

## 1 Corinthians 15:49

Just as we have borne the image of the earthy, we will also bear the image of the heavenly.

## 1 Corinthians 15:50

Now I say this, brothers and sisters, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.

## 1 Corinthians 15:51

Behold, I am telling you a mystery; we will not all sleep, but we will all be changed,

## 1 Corinthians 15:52

In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.

## 1 Corinthians 15:53

For this perishable must put on the imperishable, and this mortal must put on immortality.

## 1 Corinthians 15:54

But when this perishable puts on the imperishable, and this mortal puts on immortality, then will come about the saying that is written:  
“Death has been swallowed up in victory.

## 1 Corinthians 15:55

> Where, O death, is your victory?  
> Where, O death, is your sting?”

## 1 Corinthians 15:56

The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the Law;

## 1 Corinthians 15:57

But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

## 1 Corinthians 15:58

Therefore, my beloved brothers and sisters, be firm, immovable, always excelling in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.
