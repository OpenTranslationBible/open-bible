# 1 Corinthians Chapter 15

## 1 Corinthians 15:1

Now I declare to you, dear friends, the gospel I preached to you, which you accepted and in which you stand firm,

## 1 Corinthians 15:2

Through which you are also saved, if you hold firmly to the message I preached to you, unless your belief was without purpose.

## 1 Corinthians 15:3

For I passed on to you as of utmost importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,

## 1 Corinthians 15:4

and that He was laid to rest, and on the third day He was raised, as foretold by the Scriptures,

## 1 Corinthians 15:5

For He appeared to Cephas, and then to the Twelve.

## 1 Corinthians 15:6

Following that, He appeared to more than five hundred believers at one time, most of whom are still living, though some have passed away;

## 1 Corinthians 15:7

Afterwards, He appeared to James, and then to all the apostles;

## 1 Corinthians 15:8

And finally, as to one born at the wrong time, He appeared to me as well.

## 1 Corinthians 15:9

For I am the least of the apostles, and unworthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.

## 1 Corinthians 15:10

But by the grace of God, I am what I am, and His grace towards me was not without effect; but I worked harder than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God with me.

## 1 Corinthians 15:11

Whether then it was I or they, this is what we preach and this is what you believed.

## 1 Corinthians 15:12

Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?

## 1 Corinthians 15:13

But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ Himself has not been raised;

## 1 Corinthians 15:14

And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is without purpose, and your faith is also without purpose.

## 1 Corinthians 15:15

Furthermore, we are even found to be false witnesses about God, because we have testified about God that He raised Christ, whom He did not raise if indeed the dead are not raised.

## 1 Corinthians 15:16

For if the dead are not brought back to life, then not even Christ has been raised;

## 1 Corinthians 15:17

And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is in vain; you remain in your sins.

## 1 Corinthians 15:18

Then also those who have passed away in Christ have perished.

## 1 Corinthians 15:19

If we have hoped in Christ only for this life, we are of all people most to be pitied.

## 1 Corinthians 15:20

But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have passed away.

## 1 Corinthians 15:21

For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead also comes through a human.

## 1 Corinthians 15:22

For just as all die in Adam, so in Christ all will be brought to life.

## 1 Corinthians 15:23

But each in their own order: Christ the first fruits, then those who belong to Christ at His coming,

## 1 Corinthians 15:24

Then comes the end, when He hands over the kingdom to our God and Father, after He has abolished all rule and all authority and power.

## 1 Corinthians 15:25

For He must reign until He has placed all His enemies under His feet.

## 1 Corinthians 15:26

The final enemy to be abolished is death.

## 1 Corinthians 15:27

For He has put all things in subjection under His feet. But when He says, “All things are put in subjection,” it is evident that this excludes the One who put all things in subjection to Him.

## 1 Corinthians 15:28

When all things are subjected to Him, then the Son Himself will also be subject to the One who subjected all things to Him, so that God may be all in all.

## 1 Corinthians 15:29

Otherwise, what will those do who are baptised for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why then are they baptised for them?

## 1 Corinthians 15:30

Why do we face danger every hour?

## 1 Corinthians 15:31

I declare, dear friends, by the pride I have in you in Christ Jesus our Lord, that I face death every day.

## 1 Corinthians 15:32

If from human motives I fought with wild beasts at Ephesus, what benefit is it to me? If the dead are not raised,

> “Let’s eat and drink,  
> for tomorrow we die.”

## 1 Corinthians 15:33

Do not be misled: “Bad company corrupts good morals.”

## 1 Corinthians 15:34

Awaken to righteousness and cease sinning, for some have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame.

## 1 Corinthians 15:35

But someone will ask, “How are the dead raised? And with what kind of body do they come?”

## 1 Corinthians 15:36

Foolish one! What you plant does not come to life unless it dies;

## 1 Corinthians 15:37

And what you sow, you do not sow the body that will be, but a bare grain, perhaps of wheat or something else.

## 1 Corinthians 15:38

But God gives it a body as He desires, and to each of the seeds a body of its own.

## 1 Corinthians 15:39

Not all flesh is the same: there is one kind for humans, another for animals, another for birds, and another for fish.

## 1 Corinthians 15:40

There are also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the splendour of the heavenly is one kind, and the splendour of the earthly is another.

## 1 Corinthians 15:41

There is one splendour of the sun, another splendour of the moon, and another splendour of the stars; for star differs from star in splendour.

## 1 Corinthians 15:42

So it is with the resurrection of the dead. The body is planted perishable, it is raised imperishable;

## 1 Corinthians 15:43

Though it is planted without honour, it is raised in glory; though it is planted in weakness, it is raised in power;

## 1 Corinthians 15:44

Though it is planted as a natural body, it is raised as a spiritual body. If there exists a natural body, there too is a spiritual body.

## 1 Corinthians 15:45

As it is written: “The first man, Adam, became alive.” and the last Adam became a life-giving spirit.

## 1 Corinthians 15:46

However, the spiritual did not come first, but the natural, and then the spiritual.

## 1 Corinthians 15:47

The first man was of the earth, formed from dust; the second man is of heaven.

## 1 Corinthians 15:48

As was the man of dust, so also are those who are of the dust; and as is the heavenly man, so also are those who are of heaven.

## 1 Corinthians 15:49

Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we will also bear the image of the heavenly man.

## 1 Corinthians 15:50

Now I declare this, dear friends, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.

## 1 Corinthians 15:51

Listen, I tell you a mystery; we will not all sleep, but we will all be transformed,

## 1 Corinthians 15:52

In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be transformed.

## 1 Corinthians 15:53

For this perishable must be clothed with the imperishable, and this mortal with immortality.

## 1 Corinthians 15:54

But when this perishable is clothed with the imperishable, and this mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true:  
“Death has been swallowed up in victory.

## 1 Corinthians 15:55

> Where, O death, is your victory?  
> Where, O death, is your sting?”

## 1 Corinthians 15:56

Fot the sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the Law;

## 1 Corinthians 15:57

So, thanks be to God, who grants us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

## 1 Corinthians 15:58

Therefore, my beloved friends, be steadfast, immovable, always excelling in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.
