# 1 Corinthians Chapter 6

## 1 Corinthians 6:1

Does any one of you, when he has a case against another, dare to go to law before the unrighteous and not before the saints?

## 1 Corinthians 6:2

Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world? If the world is judged by you, are you not competent to judge trivial cases?

## 1 Corinthians 6:3

Are you not aware that we will have authority over angels? How much more should we be able to handle matters of this life?

## 1 Corinthians 6:4

So if you have law cases dealing with matters of this life, do you appoint them as judges who are of no account in the church?

## 1 Corinthians 6:5

I say this to your shame. Is it really the case that there is not one wise person among you who will be able to decide between his brothers or sisters?

## 1 Corinthians 6:6

Yet, one brother takes another to court, and this before those who do not believe!

## 1 Corinthians 6:7

In fact, it is already a loss for you that you have lawsuits with one another. Would it not be better to be wronged? Would it not be better to be cheated?

## 1 Corinthians 6:8

Instead, you yourselves commit wrongs and cheat, and you do this to your own brothers and sisters!

## 1 Corinthians 6:9

Or do you not know that those who act unjustly will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be misled; neither those who are sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor those who engage in practices contrary to nature,

## 1 Corinthians 6:10

nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor those who are habitually drunk, nor those who speak abusively, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God.

## 1 Corinthians 6:11

Some of you were like this; but you were cleansed, you were made holy, you were declared righteous in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.

## 1 Corinthians 6:12

All things are permitted for me, but not all things are beneficial. All things are permitted for me, but I will not be mastered by anything.

## 1 Corinthians 6:13

Food is for the stomach and the stomach is for food, however God will do away with both of them. Yet the body is not for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body.

## 1 Corinthians 6:14

God not only raised the Lord, but will also raise us up through His power.

## 1 Corinthians 6:15

Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take away the members of Christ and unite them with a prostitute? Certainly not!

## 1 Corinthians 6:16

Or are you not aware that the one who unites himself with a prostitute becomes one body with her? For it is said, “The two shall become one flesh.”

## 1 Corinthians 6:17

But the one who unites himself with the Lord is one spirit with Him.

## 1 Corinthians 6:18

Avoid sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the one who is sexually immoral sins against his own body.

## 1 Corinthians 6:19

Or are you not aware that your body is a sanctuary of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have received from God, and that you do not belong to yourself?

## 1 Corinthians 6:20

For you have been bought at a price: therefore honour God with your body.
