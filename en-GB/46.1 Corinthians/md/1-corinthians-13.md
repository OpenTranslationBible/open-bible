# 1 Corinthians Chapter 13

## 1 Corinthians 13:1

If I speak in the languages of humans and angels, but lack love, I am like a resounding gong or a clashing cymbal.

## 1 Corinthians 13:2

If I possess the gift of prophecy, understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have complete faith to move mountains, but lack love, I am nothing.

## 1 Corinthians 13:3

And if I give away all my possessions to charity, and if I surrender my body so that I may boast, but do not have love, it does me no good.

## 1 Corinthians 13:4

Love is patient and kind; it is not envious, it does not boast, it is not proud.

## 1 Corinthians 13:5

It does not behave rudely, it does not seek its own advantage; it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs,

## 1 Corinthians 13:6

It does not delight in wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth;

## 1 Corinthians 13:7

It consistently protects, trusts, hopes, and perseveres.

## 1 Corinthians 13:8

Love never fails; yet where there are prophecies, they will come to an end; where there are tongues, they will be silenced; where there is knowledge, it will fade away.

## 1 Corinthians 13:9

For we know partially and prophesy partially;

## 1 Corinthians 13:10

But when completeness comes, what is partial will disappear.

## 1 Corinthians 13:11

When I was a child, I spoke like a child, thought like a child, reasoned like a child; when I became an adult, I put away childish ways.

## 1 Corinthians 13:12

For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror, then we shall see face to face; now I know in part, but then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.

## 1 Corinthians 13:13

And now these three endure: faith, hope, and love. Yet the greatest of these is love.
