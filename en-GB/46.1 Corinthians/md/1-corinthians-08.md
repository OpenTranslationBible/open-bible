# 1 Corinthians Chapter 8

## 1 Corinthians 8:1

Now concerning food sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge makes one conceited, but love edifies.

## 1 Corinthians 8:2

If anyone believes he possesses knowledge, he does not yet know as he should;

## 1 Corinthians 8:3

But if anyone loves God, he is known by Him.

## 1 Corinthians 8:4

Therefore, regarding the eating of food offered to idols, we understand that an idol is insignificant in the world, and that there is no God but one.

## 1 Corinthians 8:5

For even if there are those called ‘gods’, whether in heaven or on earth, as indeed there are many ‘gods’ and many ‘lords’,

## 1 Corinthians 8:6

Yet for us there is only one God, the Father, from whom are all things, and we exist for Him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we exist through Him.

## 1 Corinthians 8:7

Nevertheless, not everyone possesses this understanding; some, being accustomed to the idol until now, eat food as if it were offered to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.

## 1 Corinthians 8:8

Food does not bring us closer to God; we are neither worse off if we do not eat, nor better if we do eat.

## 1 Corinthians 8:9

But be careful that this freedom of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to those who are weak.

## 1 Corinthians 8:10

For if someone sees you, the one who has knowledge, dining in an idol’s temple, will his conscience, if he is weak, not be encouraged to eat things sacrificed to idols?

## 1 Corinthians 8:11

For through your knowledge the one who is weak is harmed, the brother or sister for whom Christ died.

## 1 Corinthians 8:12

Thus, by sinning against the brothers and sisters and injuring their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.

## 1 Corinthians 8:13

Therefore, if food leads my brother to stumble, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause my brother to fall.
