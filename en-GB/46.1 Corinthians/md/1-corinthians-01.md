# 1 Corinthians Chapter 1

## 1 Corinthians 1:1

Paul, appointed as an apostle of Jesus Christ by God's will, and Sosthenes our brother,

## 1 Corinthians 1:2

To the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, called as saints, with all who in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours:

## 1 Corinthians 1:3

May you receive grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

## 1 Corinthians 1:4

I continually thank my God for you because of the grace of God given to you in Christ Jesus,

## 1 Corinthians 1:5

That in every respect you were enriched in Him, in all speech and all knowledge,

## 1 Corinthians 1:6

Just as the testimony about Christ was confirmed among you,

## 1 Corinthians 1:7

So that you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly await the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ,

## 1 Corinthians 1:8

Who will also sustain you to the end, blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.

## 1 Corinthians 1:9

God, who is faithful, has called you into fellowship with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.

## 1 Corinthians 1:10

Now I urge you, brothers and sisters, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all agree and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be made complete in the same mind and in the same judgement.

## 1 Corinthians 1:11

For I have been informed about you, my brothers and sisters, by Chloe’s people, that there are quarrels among you.

## 1 Corinthians 1:12

Now I mean this, that each one of you is saying, “I am with Paul,” and “I am with Apollos,” and “I am with Cephas,” and “I am with Christ.”

## 1 Corinthians 1:13

Has Christ been divided? Paul was not crucified for you, was he? Or were you baptised in the name of Paul?

## 1 Corinthians 1:14

I thank God that I baptised none of you except Crispus and Gaius,

## 1 Corinthians 1:15

So that no one would say you were baptised in my name.

## 1 Corinthians 1:16

But I did baptise the household of Stephanas also; beyond that, I do not know whether I baptised anyone else.

## 1 Corinthians 1:17

For Christ did not send me to baptise, but to preach the gospel, not with eloquent wisdom, so that the cross of Christ would not be made void.

## 1 Corinthians 1:18

For the message of the cross seems like foolishness to the lost, but to us who are being saved, it is the power of God.

## 1 Corinthians 1:19

For scripture says:

> “I will bring to nothing the wisdom of the wise,  
> And the understanding of the discerning I will thwart.”

## 1 Corinthians 1:20

Where is the wise person? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has God not shown the wisdom of the world to be foolish?

## 1 Corinthians 1:21

For since in God's wisdom the world through its wisdom did not come to know God, God was pleased through the perceived foolishness of the message preached to save those who believe.

## 1 Corinthians 1:22

For indeed Jews ask for signs, and Greeks seek wisdom;

## 1 Corinthians 1:23

But we declare Christ crucified, an obstacle to Jews and folly to Gentiles,

## 1 Corinthians 1:24

But to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power and wisdom of God.

## 1 Corinthians 1:25

For what seems foolish in God is wiser than human wisdom, and what seems weak in God is stronger than human strength.

## 1 Corinthians 1:26

For consider your calling, brothers and sisters, that there were not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble;

## 1 Corinthians 1:27

But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to shame the things that are strong,

## 1 Corinthians 1:28

And the insignificant things of the world and the despised God has chosen, the things that are not, so that He may nullify the things that are,

## 1 Corinthians 1:29

So that no human may boast before God.

## 1 Corinthians 1:30

But it is due to Him that you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification and redemption,

## 1 Corinthians 1:31

Therefore, as scripture says: “Let he who boasts, boast in the Lord.”
