# 1 Corinthians Chapter 7

## 1 Corinthians 7:1

Now regarding the matters you wrote about: it is commendable for a man to refrain from intimate relations with a woman.

## 1 Corinthians 7:2

But because of sexual immorality, each man is to have his own wife, and each woman is to have her own husband.

## 1 Corinthians 7:3

The husband should meet his obligations to his wife, and likewise the wife to her husband.

## 1 Corinthians 7:4

The wife does not have sole authority over her own body, but the husband shares it; and likewise, the husband does not have sole authority over his own body, but the wife shares it.

## 1 Corinthians 7:5

Do not withhold yourselves from one another, except by mutual consent for a time, so that you may dedicate yourselves to prayer, and then come together again so that Satan will not tempt you due to your lack of self-control.

## 1 Corinthians 7:6

I say this as a suggestion, not as a directive.

## 1 Corinthians 7:7

I wish that all people were as I am. However, each person has their own gift from God, one of one kind and one of another.

## 1 Corinthians 7:8

But I say to the unmarried and to widows that it is good for them if they remain as I am.

## 1 Corinthians 7:9

But if they cannot exercise self-control, they should marry; for it is better to marry than to be consumed with passion.

## 1 Corinthians 7:10

To the married, I give this instruction, not I, but the Lord: a wife should not separate from her husband

## 1 Corinthians 7:11

(But if she does separate, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband), and a husband should not divorce his wife.

## 1 Corinthians 7:12

To the rest I say, not the Lord, that if any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him, he should not divorce her.

## 1 Corinthians 7:13

And if any woman has a husband who is not a believer, and he is willing to live with her, she should not divorce her husband.

## 1 Corinthians 7:14

For the unbelieving husband is consecrated through his wife, and the unbelieving wife is consecrated through the believing husband; otherwise, your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.

## 1 Corinthians 7:15

If the unbelieving partner chooses to leave, let them do so; the brother or sister is not bound in such circumstances, but God has called us to live in peace.

## 1 Corinthians 7:16

For how can you be certain, wife, whether you will lead your husband to salvation? Or you, husband, whether you will lead your wife to the same?

## 1 Corinthians 7:17

Nevertheless, as the Lord has assigned to each one, as God has called each, let them live in this way. This is my rule in all the churches.

## 1 Corinthians 7:18

Was anyone called while circumcised? He should not seek to remove the marks of circumcision. Was anyone called while uncircumcised? He should not seek circumcision.

## 1 Corinthians 7:19

The physical state of circumcision or uncircumcision is of no consequence, but what truly matters is keeping the commandments of God.

## 1 Corinthians 7:20

Each person should remain in the state in which they were called.

## 1 Corinthians 7:21

Were you called as a slave? Do not let it trouble you. But if you can gain your freedom, take the opportunity.

## 1 Corinthians 7:22

For the one who was called in the Lord while a slave is the Lord’s freed person; similarly, the one who was called while free is Christ’s servant.

## 1 Corinthians 7:23

You were purchased at a cost; therefore, do not become enslaved by people.

## 1 Corinthians 7:24

Brothers and sisters, each one should remain with God in the state in which they were called.

## 1 Corinthians 7:25

Now regarding those who are unmarried, I have no command from the Lord, but I offer my opinion as one who, by the Lord’s mercy, is trustworthy.

## 1 Corinthians 7:26

I think, then, that it is good, in view of the present crisis, for a person to remain as they are.

## 1 Corinthians 7:27

Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be released. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife.

## 1 Corinthians 7:28

But if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. However, such individuals will face difficulties in this life, and I wish to spare you that.

## 1 Corinthians 7:29

But this I say, brothers and sisters: the time is short, so that from now on those who have wives should live as though they had none,

## 1 Corinthians 7:30

And those who mourn, as though they did not mourn; and those who are joyful, as though they were not; and those who buy, as though they did not own anything;

## 1 Corinthians 7:31

And those who use the world, as though they did not fully engage with it; for the present form of this world is passing away.

## 1 Corinthians 7:32

I want you to be free from concerns. The unmarried man is focused on the Lord’s affairs, how he may please the Lord;

## 1 Corinthians 7:33

But the married man is concerned about worldly matters, how he may please his wife,

## 1 Corinthians 7:34

And his interests are divided. The unmarried woman, and the virgin, is focused on the Lord’s affairs, that she may be holy in both body and spirit; but the married woman is concerned about worldly matters, how she may please her husband.

## 1 Corinthians 7:35

I say this for your own benefit, not to impose a restriction on you, but to promote what is proper and to secure undistracted devotion to the Lord.

## 1 Corinthians 7:36

But if anyone thinks he is not behaving properly towards his betrothed, if she is past the age of marriage and it seems necessary, let him do as he wishes, he is not sinning; they should marry.

## 1 Corinthians 7:37

But the one who stands firm in his heart, not under compulsion, but has control over his own will, and has decided in his own heart to keep his betrothed, will do well.

## 1 Corinthians 7:38

So then, the one who gives his betrothed in marriage does well, and the one who does not give her in marriage will do even better.

## 1 Corinthians 7:39

A wife is committed to her husband as long as he lives; but if her husband passes away, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, only in the Lord.

## 1 Corinthians 7:40

In my opinion, she is happier if she remains as she is; and I believe that I also have the Spirit of God.
