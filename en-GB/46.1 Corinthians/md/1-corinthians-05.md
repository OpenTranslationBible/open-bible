# 1 Corinthians Chapter 5

## 1 Corinthians 5:1

It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and sexual immorality of such a kind as does not even exist among the Gentiles, namely, that someone has his father’s wife.

## 1 Corinthians 5:2

You have become proud and have not mourned instead, so that the one who has done this deed would be removed from your midst.

## 1 Corinthians 5:3

For I, on my part, though absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged him who has committed this, as though I were present.

## 1 Corinthians 5:4

By the authority of our Lord Jesus, when you are gathered together, and I am with you in spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus,

## 1 Corinthians 5:5

I have decided to turn such a person over to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, so that his spirit may be saved on the day of the Lord.

## 1 Corinthians 5:6

Your boasting is not beneficial. Do you not know that a little leaven affects the whole batch of dough?

## 1 Corinthians 5:7

Remove the old leaven so that you may be a new batch, just as you are in fact unleavened. For Christ our Passover also has been sacrificed.

## 1 Corinthians 5:8

Therefore, let us keep the festival, not with the old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.

## 1 Corinthians 5:9

I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people;

## 1 Corinthians 5:10

I did not mean at all with the sexually immoral people of this world, or with the greedy and swindlers, or with idolaters, for then you would have to leave the world.

## 1 Corinthians 5:11

But actually, I wrote to you not to associate with any so-called brother if he is a sexually immoral person, or greedy, or an idolater, or verbally abusive, or a drunkard, or a swindler—not even to eat with such a person.

## 1 Corinthians 5:12

For what concern is it of mine to judge those outside? Do you not judge those who are within the church?

## 1 Corinthians 5:13

But those who are outside, God will judge. Expel the wicked person from among yourselves.
