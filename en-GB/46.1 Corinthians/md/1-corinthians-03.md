# 1 Corinthians Chapter 3

## 1 Corinthians 3:1

And I, brothers and sisters, could not address you as spiritual individuals, but as those who are worldly, like infants in Christ.

## 1 Corinthians 3:2

I provided you with milk, not solid food, because you were not yet ready for it. Even now, you are still not ready,

## 1 Corinthians 3:3

For you are still worldly. Since there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not worldly, behaving like ordinary people?

## 1 Corinthians 3:4

For when one says, “I am with Paul,” and another, “I am with Apollos,” are you not acting like mere humans?

## 1 Corinthians 3:5

What is Apollos? What is Paul? They are servants through whom you came to believe, as the Lord assigned to each.

## 1 Corinthians 3:6

I planted, Apollos watered, but it was God who caused the growth.

## 1 Corinthians 3:7

So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is of significance, but only God, who brings about the growth.

## 1 Corinthians 3:8

Now the one who plants and the one who waters have one purpose, and each will be rewarded according to their own labour.

## 1 Corinthians 3:9

For we are fellow workers in God’s service; you are God’s field, God’s building.

## 1 Corinthians 3:10

By the grace of God given to me, I laid a foundation as a wise builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one should build with care.

## 1 Corinthians 3:11

For no one can establish any foundation other than the one already established, which is Jesus Christ.

## 1 Corinthians 3:12

If anyone builds on this foundation using gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw,

## 1 Corinthians 3:13

Their work will be revealed for what it truly is, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be disclosed with fire, and the fire will assess the quality of each person’s work.

## 1 Corinthians 3:14

If what has been constructed endures, the builder will receive a reward.

## 1 Corinthians 3:15

If it is consumed, the builder will suffer loss but will still be saved—though only as one escaping through the flames.

## 1 Corinthians 3:16

Are you not aware that you are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit resides in you?

## 1 Corinthians 3:17

If anyone harms God’s temple, God will bring ruin upon that person; for God’s temple is sacred, and you collectively are that temple.

## 1 Corinthians 3:18

Let no one deceive themselves. If any of you think you are wise by the standards of this age, you should become “fools” so that you may become wise.

## 1 Corinthians 3:19

For the wisdom of this world is seen as foolishness in God’s sight. As it is written: “He catches the wise in their craftiness”;

## 1 Corinthians 3:20

Moreover, it is said, “The Lord is aware that the thoughts of the wise are in vain.”

## 1 Corinthians 3:21

So then, let there be no more boasting about human leaders! All things are yours,

## 1 Corinthians 3:22

Whether it be Paul, Apollos, Cephas, the world, life, death, the present, or the future—all are yours,

## 1 Corinthians 3:23

And you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God.
