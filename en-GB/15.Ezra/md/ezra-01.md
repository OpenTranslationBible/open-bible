## Ezra 1:1

In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, to fulfil the word of the Lord spoken by Jeremiah, the Lord stirred the heart of Cyrus king of Persia to issue a proclamation throughout his realm and also to put it in writing:

## Ezra 1:2

“This is what Cyrus king of Persia says: ‘The Lord, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and has appointed me to build a house for Him in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.

## Ezra 1:3

Any among you who are His people, may their God be with them, and let them go up to Jerusalem in Judah and build the house of the Lord, the God of Israel, who is in Jerusalem.

## Ezra 1:4

And in any place where survivors may now reside, the people are to support them with silver and gold, with goods and livestock, along with freewill offerings for the house of God in Jerusalem.’”

---

## Ezra 1:5

Then the heads of the families of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests and Levites—everyone whose spirit God had moved—prepared to go up and build the house of the Lord in Jerusalem.

## Ezra 1:6

All their neighbours assisted them with articles of silver and gold, with goods and livestock, and with valuable gifts, besides all the freewill offerings.

## Ezra 1:7

Moreover, King Cyrus brought out the articles belonging to the house of the Lord, which Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from Jerusalem and placed in the house of his gods.

## Ezra 1:8

Cyrus king of Persia had them brought out by Mithredath the treasurer, who counted them out to Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah.

## Ezra 1:9

This was the inventory:

> thirty gold dishes,
> a thousand silver dishes,
> and twenty-nine silver pans;

## Ezra 1:10

> thirty gold bowls,
> four hundred and ten matching silver bowls,
> and a thousand other articles.

## Ezra 1:11

In total, there were 5,400 articles of gold and silver. Sheshbazzar brought all these along with the exiles when they came up from Babylon to Jerusalem.
