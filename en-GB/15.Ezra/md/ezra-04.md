# Ezra Chapter 4

## Ezra 4:1

Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the exiles were building a temple to the Lord, the God of Israel,

## Ezra 4:2

they approached Zerubbabel and the heads of the fathers' households, saying, “Let us build with you, for like you, we seek your God and have been offering sacrifices to Him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who brought us here.”

---

## Ezra 4:3

But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of the fathers' households of Israel said to them, “You have no part with us in building a house to our God; we alone will build for the Lord, the God of Israel, as King Cyrus, the king of Persia, has commanded us.”

## Ezra 4:4

Then the people of the land discouraged the people of Judah and made them afraid to continue building,

## Ezra 4:5

and hired counsellors against them to frustrate their plans all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.

## Ezra 4:6

At the beginning of the reign of Ahasuerus, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.

## Ezra 4:7

And in the days of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their associates wrote to Artaxerxes king of Persia; the letter was written in Aramaic and translated.

## Ezra 4:8

Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe composed a letter concerning Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes, stating:

## Ezra 4:9

Rehum the commander, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their associates—the judges, the lesser governors, the officials, the secretaries, the men of Persia, Uruk, and Babylon, the men of Susa, that is, the Elamites,

## Ezra 4:10

and the rest of the nations whom the great and honourable Osnappar deported and settled in the city of Samaria and in the rest of the region beyond the River.

## Ezra 4:11

(This is a copy of the letter they sent to him.) “To King Artaxerxes, from your servants, the men of the region beyond the River: And now,

## Ezra 4:12

let it be known to the king that the Jews who came up from you have come to us at Jerusalem; they are rebuilding the rebellious and wicked city, and are finishing the walls and repairing the foundations.

---

## Ezra 4:13

Now let it be known to the king that if this city is rebuilt and the walls are finished, they will not pay tribute, custom, or toll, and it will be detrimental to the royal revenue.

## Ezra 4:14

Now because we are in the service of the palace, and it is not fitting for us to see the king’s dishonour, we have sent and informed the king,

## Ezra 4:15

so that a search may be made in the record books of your predecessors. You will find in the records that this city is a rebellious city, harmful to kings and provinces, and has a history of revolt. That is why this city was destroyed.

## Ezra 4:16

We inform the king that if this city is rebuilt and the walls finished, you will have no possession in the province beyond the River.”

## Ezra 4:17

The king sent this reply: “To Rehum the commander, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their associates who live in Samaria and the rest of the province beyond the River: Peace. And now,

## Ezra 4:18

the document you sent to us has been translated and read before me.

## Ezra 4:19

I issued a decree and a search was made, and it was found that this city has a long history of revolt against kings and has been a place of rebellion and sedition.

## Ezra 4:20

Jerusalem has had powerful kings ruling over the whole of the province beyond the River, and tribute, custom, and toll were paid to them.

## Ezra 4:21

Now issue a decree to make these men stop work, so that this city will not be rebuilt until a decree is issued by me.

## Ezra 4:22

Take care not to be negligent in this matter. Why should damage increase to the detriment of the kings?”

## Ezra 4:23

Then, as soon as the copy of King Artaxerxes’ letter was read before Rehum, Shimshai the scribe, and their associates, they went in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews and stopped them by force of arms.

## Ezra 4:24

Thus the work on the house of God in Jerusalem ceased, and it was stopped until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.
