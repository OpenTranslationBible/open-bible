## Ezra 7:1

After these events, during the reign of Artaxerxes, king of Persia, Ezra went up to Jerusalem. He was the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,

## Ezra 7:2

descendant of Shallum, descendant of Zadok, descendant of Ahitub,

## Ezra 7:3

descendant of Amariah, descendant of Azariah, descendant of Meraioth,

descendant of Zerahiah, descendant of Uzzi, descendant of Bukki,

## Ezra 7:5

descendant of Abishua, descendant of Phinehas, descendant of Eleazar, descendant of Aaron the chief priest.

## Ezra 7:6

This Ezra came up from Babylon. He was a scribe skilled in the Law of Moses, which the Lord, the God of Israel, had given. The king granted him all he requested, for the hand of the Lord his God was upon him.

## Ezra 7:7

Some of the Israelites, including priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, and temple servants, went up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes.

## Ezra 7:8

Ezra arrived in Jerusalem in the fifth month, during the seventh year of the king.

---

## Ezra 7:9

On the first day of the first month, he began his journey from Babylon, and he arrived in Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month, because the good hand of his God was upon him.

## Ezra 7:10

For Ezra had set his heart to study the Law of the Lord, to practice it, and to teach its statutes and ordinances in Israel.

## Ezra 7:11

This is a copy of the letter King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, a scribe learned in the words of the commandments of the Lord and His statutes for Israel:

## Ezra 7:12

“Artaxerxes, king of kings, to Ezra the priest, scribe of the Law of the God of heaven: Perfect peace. And now

## Ezra 7:13

I have issued a decree that any of the people of Israel, including priests and Levites, in my kingdom who are willing to go to Jerusalem, may go with you.

## Ezra 7:14

You are sent by the king and his seven advisers to inquire about Judah and Jerusalem with respect to the Law of your God, which is in your hand.

## Ezra 7:15

Moreover, you are to carry the silver and gold which the king and his advisers have voluntarily given to the God of Israel, whose dwelling is in Jerusalem,

## Ezra 7:16

along with all the silver and gold you find in the province of Babylon, together with the freewill offerings of the people and priests for the house of their God in Jerusalem.

## Ezra 7:17

With this money, be sure to buy bulls, rams, and lambs, along with their grain offerings and drink offerings, and offer them on the altar of the house of your God in Jerusalem.

## Ezra 7:18

You and your fellow Israelites may then do whatever seems best with the rest of the silver and gold, according to the will of your God.

## Ezra 7:19

Deliver all the articles entrusted to you for the service of the house of your God to the God of Jerusalem.

## Ezra 7:20

And the rest of the needs for the house of your God, which you may have to provide, you may supply from the royal treasury.

## Ezra 7:21

“I, King Artaxerxes, issue a decree to all the treasurers in the provinces beyond the Euphrates River, that whatever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the Law of the God of heaven, requires of you, it shall be done diligently,

## Ezra 7:22

up to one hundred talents of silver, one hundred cors of wheat, one hundred baths of wine, one hundred baths of olive oil, and salt without measure.

## Ezra 7:23

Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven must be done with zeal for the house of the God of heaven, so that there will not be wrath against the kingdom of the king and his sons.

## Ezra 7:24

We also inform you that it is not permitted to impose tax, tribute, or toll on any of the priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, temple servants, or other workers of this house of God.

## Ezra 7:25

“And you, Ezra, according to the wisdom of your God which you possess, appoint magistrates and judges to judge all the people in the province beyond the Euphrates—all who know the laws of your God. And you are to teach anyone who is ignorant of them.

## Ezra 7:26

Whoever does not obey the law of your God and the law of the king is to be punished by death, banishment, confiscation of property, or imprisonment as deemed necessary.”

## Ezra 7:27

Blessed be the Lord, the God of our ancestors, who has put such a thing as this in the king’s heart, to glorify the house of the Lord in Jerusalem,

## Ezra 7:28

and who has extended His favour to me before the king and his counsellors and all the king’s mighty officials. Because the hand of the Lord my God was upon me, I took courage and gathered leading men from Israel to go up with me.
