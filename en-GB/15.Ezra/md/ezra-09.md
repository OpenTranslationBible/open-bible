# Ezra Chapter 9

## Ezra 9:1

After these matters were completed, the officials approached me and said, “The people of Israel, including the priests and the Levites, have not kept themselves distinct from the neighbouring peoples and their abominations, such as those of the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians, and Amorites.

## Ezra 9:2

They have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and their sons, thus mingling the holy lineage with the peoples of the lands. Indeed, the leaders and officials have been foremost in this unfaithfulness.”

## Ezra 9:3

Upon hearing this, I tore my garment and cloak, pulled hair from my head and beard, and sat down utterly appalled.

## Ezra 9:4

Then all who trembled at the words of the God of Israel, on account of the exiles' unfaithfulness, gathered around me, and I remained appalled until the evening sacrifice.

## Ezra 9:5

At the time of the evening offering, I arose from my self-abasement, with my garment and cloak torn, and fell on my knees, spreading out my hands to the Lord my God;

## Ezra 9:6

and I prayed, “O my God, I am too ashamed and humiliated to lift up my face to You, my God, for our iniquities have risen above our heads, and our guilt has reached up to the heavens.

## Ezra 9:7

From the days of our ancestors to this very day, our guilt has been great. Because of our sins, we, our kings, and our priests have been delivered into the hands of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, to plunder, and to disgrace, as is the case today.

## Ezra 9:8

But now, for a brief moment, the Lord our God has shown us grace by leaving us a remnant and giving us a secure foothold in His holy place, so that our God may enlighten our eyes and grant us a little relief in our bondage.

## Ezra 9:9

For though we are slaves, our God has not abandoned us in our bondage. He has extended kindness to us in the sight of the kings of Persia, granting us new life to rebuild the house of our God and restore its ruins, and has given us a wall of protection in Judah and Jerusalem.

## Ezra 9:10

“And now, our God, what can we say after this? For we have indeed forsaken Your commandments,

## Ezra 9:11

which You gave through Your servants the prophets, saying, ‘The land you are entering to possess is a land defiled by the impurity of the peoples of the lands, with their abominations filling it from one end to the other.

## Ezra 9:12

Therefore, do not give your daughters in marriage to their sons nor take their daughters for your sons. Never seek their peace or prosperity, that you may be strong and eat the good of the land and leave it as an everlasting inheritance to your children.’

## Ezra 9:13

After all that has come upon us for our evil deeds and great guilt, since You, our God, have punished us less than our sins deserved and have given us such a remnant as this,

## Ezra 9:14

shall we again break Your commandments and intermarry with the peoples who practise such abominations? Would You not be angry with us to the point of destruction, leaving us no remnant or survivor?

## Ezra 9:15

O Lord, God of Israel, You are righteous! We are left this day as a remnant. Here we stand before You in our guilt, and because of it, none of us can stand in Your presence.”
