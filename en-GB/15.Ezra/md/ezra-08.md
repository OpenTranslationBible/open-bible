# Ezra Chapter 8

## Ezra 8:1
These are the heads of the families and the genealogical records of those who went up with me from Babylon during the reign of King Artaxerxes:

## Ezra 8:2
of the descendants of Phinehas, Gershom; of the descendants of Ithamar, Daniel; of the descendants of David, Hattush;

## Ezra 8:3
of the descendants of Shekaniah, who was of the descendants of Parosh, Zechariah, and with him were listed 150 males;

## Ezra 8:4
of the descendants of Pahath-Moab, Eliehoenai son of Zerahiah, and with him 200 males;

## Ezra 8:5
of the descendants of Zattu, Shekaniah son of Jahaziel, and with him 300 males;

## Ezra 8:6
of the descendants of Adin, Ebed son of Jonathan, and with him 50 males;

## Ezra 8:7
of the descendants of Elam, Jeshaiah son of Athaliah, and with him 70 males;

## Ezra 8:8
of the descendants of Shephatiah, Zebadiah son of Michael, and with him 80 males;

## Ezra 8:9
of the descendants of Joab, Obadiah son of Jehiel, and with him 218 males;

## Ezra 8:10
of the descendants of Bani, Shelomith son of Josiphiah, and with him 160 males;

## Ezra 8:11
of the descendants of Bebai, Zechariah son of Bebai, and with him 28 males;

## Ezra 8:12
of the descendants of Azgad, Johanan son of Hakkatan, and with him 110 males;

## Ezra 8:13
of the descendants of Adonikam, the last ones, whose names were Eliphelet, Jeuel, and Shemaiah, and with them 60 males;

## Ezra 8:14
of the descendants of Bigvai, Uthai and Zakkur, and with them 70 males.

## Ezra 8:15
I assembled them at the river that flows towards Ahava, and we camped there for three days. When I reviewed the people and the priests, I found no Levites there.

## Ezra 8:16
So I summoned Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, who were leading men, and Joiarib and Elnathan, who were teachers.

## Ezra 8:17
I sent them to Iddo, the leader in Casiphia, instructing them what to say to Iddo and his fellow Levites, the temple servants in Casiphia, to bring us ministers for the house of our God.

## Ezra 8:18
Because the good hand of our God was upon us, they brought us Sherebiah, a man of insight, from the descendants of Mahli, son of Levi, son of Israel, and Sherebiah’s sons and brothers, 18 in total;

## Ezra 8:19
and Hashabiah, along with Jeshaiah from the descendants of Merari, and his brothers and their sons, 20 in total.

## Ezra 8:20
They also brought 220 of the temple servants, whom David and the officials had appointed to assist the Levites, all registered by name.

## Ezra 8:21
There, by the river Ahava, I proclaimed a fast, that we might humble ourselves before our God and seek from Him a safe journey for us, our children, and all our possessions.

## Ezra 8:22
I was embarrassed to request soldiers and horsemen from the king to protect us from enemies on the road, because we had told the king, “The hand of our God is favourably disposed to all who seek Him, but His power and anger are against all who forsake Him.”

## Ezra 8:23
So we fasted and entreated our God about this, and He listened to our plea.

## Ezra 8:24
Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests: Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and with them ten of their brothers.

## Ezra 8:25
I weighed out to them the silver, the gold, and the articles, the offering for the house of our God that the king, his advisers, his officials, and all Israel present had contributed.

## Ezra 8:26
I weighed out to them 650 talents of silver, silver articles weighing 100 talents, and 100 talents of gold,

## Ezra 8:27
20 gold bowls valued at 1,000 darics, and two fine articles of polished bronze, as precious as gold.

## Ezra 8:28
I said to them, “You are holy to the Lord, and the articles are holy; the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to the Lord, the God of your ancestors.

## Ezra 8:29
Guard them carefully until you weigh them out in the chambers of the house of the Lord in Jerusalem before the leading priests, the Levites, and the family heads of Israel.”

## Ezra 8:30
So the priests and the Levites received the silver, the gold, and the sacred articles that had been weighed out to be taken to the house of our God in Jerusalem.

## Ezra 8:31
On the twelfth day of the first month, we set out from the river Ahava to go to Jerusalem. The hand of our God was upon us, and He protected us from enemies and ambushes along the way.

## Ezra 8:32
So we arrived in Jerusalem and stayed there for three days.

## Ezra 8:33
On the fourth day, in the house of our God, we weighed out the silver, the gold, and the sacred articles into the hands of Meremoth son of Uriah, the priest. Eleazar son of Phinehas was with him, and so were the Levites Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui.

## Ezra 8:34
Everything was accounted for by number and weight, and the entire weight was recorded at that time.

## Ezra 8:35
Then the exiles who had returned from captivity offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel: twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven male lambs, and twelve male goats as a sin offering. All this was a burnt offering to the Lord.

## Ezra 8:36
They also delivered the king’s orders to the king’s satraps and the governors of the provinces beyond the Euphrates, who then supported the people and the house of God.
