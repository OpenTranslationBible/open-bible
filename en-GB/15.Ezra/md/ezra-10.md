# Ezra Chapter 10

## Ezra 10:1

While Ezra was praying and making confession, weeping and lying prostrate before the house of God, a very large assembly of Israelites—men, women, and children—gathered around him, for the people wept bitterly.

## Ezra 10:2

Then Shecaniah son of Jehiel, one of the descendants of Elam, said to Ezra, “We have been unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women from the peoples of the land. Yet there is hope for Israel despite this.

## Ezra 10:3

Let us now make a covenant with our God to send away all these women and their children, following the advice of my lord and those who tremble at the commandment of our God. Let it be done according to the Law.

## Ezra 10:4

Arise, for this matter is your responsibility. We will support you, so be courageous and act.”

## Ezra 10:5

So Ezra rose and made the leading priests, the Levites, and all Israel take an oath to do what had been proposed. And they took the oath.

## Ezra 10:6

Then Ezra withdrew from before the house of God and went to the chamber of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. He did not eat bread or drink water there, for he was mourning over the unfaithfulness of the exiles.

## Ezra 10:7

A proclamation was issued throughout Judah and Jerusalem for all the exiles to assemble in Jerusalem.

## Ezra 10:8

Anyone who did not appear within three days would forfeit all his property, in accordance with the decision of the leaders and elders, and would be excluded from the assembly of the exiles.

## Ezra 10:9

Within the three days, all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered in Jerusalem. On the twentieth day of the ninth month, all the people sat in the square before the house of God, trembling because of this matter and the heavy rain.

## Ezra 10:10

Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, “You have been unfaithful by marrying foreign women, adding to the guilt of Israel.

## Ezra 10:11

Now make confession to the Lord, the God of your ancestors, and do His will. Separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from your foreign wives.”

## Ezra 10:12

The whole assembly responded with a loud voice, “It is our duty to do as you have said.

## Ezra 10:13

However, there are many people here, and it is the rainy season; we cannot stand outside. Besides, this matter cannot be resolved in a day or two, for we have sinned greatly in this thing.

## Ezra 10:14

Let our leaders act on behalf of the whole assembly, and let everyone in our towns who has married a foreign woman come at appointed times, along with the elders and judges of each town, until the fierce anger of our God in this matter is turned away from us.”

## Ezra 10:15

Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah were the only ones who opposed this, with Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite supporting them.

## Ezra 10:16

So the exiles did as proposed. Ezra the priest selected men who were heads of families, one from each family division, all of them designated by name. They convened on the first day of the tenth month to investigate the matter,
