## Ezra 3:8

In the second year of their arrival at the house of God in Jerusalem, in the second month, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Jeshua son of Jozadak, and the rest of their brothers—the priests, the Levites, and all who had returned from the captivity to Jerusalem—began the work. They appointed Levites twenty years old and upwards to oversee the building of the house of the Lord.

When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the Lord, the priests stood in their vestments with trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise the Lord, as directed by King David of Israel.

## Ezra 3:11

With praise and thanksgiving, they sang to the Lord: “He is good; his love towards Israel endures forever.” And all the people gave a great shout of joy to the Lord, because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid.

## Ezra 3:12

However, many of the older priests, Levites, and family heads, who had seen the former temple, wept aloud when they saw the foundation of this temple being laid, while many others shouted for joy.

## Ezra 3:13

No one could distinguish the sound of the joyful shouts from the sound of weeping, because the people made so much noise, and the sound was heard far away.
