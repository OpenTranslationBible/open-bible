## Ezra 6:3

In the first year of King Cyrus, Cyrus the king issued a decree:

‘Concerning the house of God in Jerusalem, let that house, the place where sacrifices are offered, be rebuilt,  
and its foundations be retained, its height being sixty cubits and its width sixty cubits;

## Ezra 6:4

with three layers of large stones and one layer of timber.  
And let the cost be paid from the royal treasury.

## Ezra 6:5

Also, let the gold and silver utensils of the house of God,  
which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon,  
be returned and brought to their places in the temple in Jerusalem;  
and you shall put them in the house of God.’

## Ezra 6:6

Now therefore, Tattenai, governor of the province beyond the Euphrates River,  
Shethar-bozenai, and your colleagues, the officials of that province, stay away from there.

Leave that work on the house of God alone;  
let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews rebuild that house of God on its site.

## Ezra 6:8

Moreover, I issue a decree as to what you are to do for these elders of Judah in the rebuilding of that house of God:

The full cost is to be paid to these people from the royal treasury out of the taxes of the provinces beyond the Euphrates River,  
and that without interruption.

## Ezra 6:9

And whatever is needed—bulls, rams, and lambs for a burnt offering to the God of heaven,  
wheat, salt, wine, and anointing oil, as the priests in Jerusalem request—  
it is to be given to them daily without fail,

## Ezra 6:10

so that they may offer acceptable sacrifices to the God of heaven  
and pray for the lives of the king and his sons.

## Ezra 6:11

And I issued a decree that any person who violates this decree,  
a timber shall be pulled out of his house and he shall be impaled on it,  
and his house shall be turned into a refuse heap as a result.

## Ezra 6:12

And may the God who has made His name dwell there overthrow any king or people  
who attempts to change it, so as to destroy that house of God in Jerusalem.

I, Darius, have issued this decree; let it be carried out with all diligence!”

## Ezra 6:13

Then Tattenai, the governor of the province beyond the Euphrates River,  
Shethar-bozenai and their colleagues carried out the decree with all diligence, just as King Darius had sent.

## Ezra 6:14

And the elders of the Jews were successful in building through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo.

The exiles observed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.

## Ezra 6:20

## Ezra 6:21

Then the sons of Israel who returned from exile,  
and all those who had separated themselves from the impurity of the nations of the land to join them,  
to seek the Lord God of Israel, ate the Passover.

And they celebrated the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with joy,  
because the Lord had made them joyful,  
and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria toward them  
to encourage them in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.
