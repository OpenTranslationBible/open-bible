Now, Tattenai, governor of the province beyond the River, Shethar-Bozenai, and your colleagues, the officials of that region, stay away from there.

Whatever is needed—bulls, rams, and lambs for burnt offerings to the God of heaven, and wheat, salt, wine, and olive oil, as requested by the priests in Jerusalem—must be provided to them daily without fail,

so that they may offer sacrifices to the God of heaven and seek the well-being of the king and his sons.

## Ezra 6:11

I also decree that if anyone violates this edict, a beam is to be pulled from their house and they are to be impaled on it, and their house is to be made a refuse heap for this offence.

## Ezra 6:12

May the God who has caused His name to dwell there overthrow any king or people who attempts to alter this decree or destroy this house of God in Jerusalem. I, Darius, have issued this decree; let it be executed with diligence.

They appointed the priests in their divisions and the Levites in their groups for the service of God in Jerusalem, as it is written in the Book of Moses.

## Ezra 6:19

On the fourteenth day of the first month, the exiles observed the Passover.

The priests and Levites had purified themselves together; all of them were ceremonially clean. The Levites slaughtered the Passover lamb for all the exiles, for their brothers the priests, and for themselves.

## Ezra 6:21

So the Israelites who had returned from exile ate it, along with all who had separated themselves from the impurity of the nations to seek the Lord, the God of Israel.

## Ezra 6:22

For seven days they celebrated with joy the Festival of Unleavened Bread, because the Lord had filled them with joy by changing the heart of the king of Assyria towards them, to encourage them in the work on the house of God, the God of Israel.
