## Ezra 5:3

During this period, Tattenai, the governor of the region beyond the Euphrates, along with Shethar-Bozenai and their colleagues, approached them and inquired, “Who has given you the authority to rebuild this temple and complete this structure?”

## Ezra 5:4

They also inquired about the names of the individuals who were involved in the construction of this building.

## Ezra 5:5

However, the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, and they were not hindered until the matter could be reported to Darius and a response was received.

## Ezra 5:6

Here is a copy of the letter that Tattenai, the governor of the region beyond the Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai and their associates, the officials of that region, sent to King Darius.

## Ezra 5:7

The report they dispatched to him was written as follows:
“To King Darius:

All peace.

## Ezra 5:8

We wish to inform the king that we visited the province of Judah, to the temple of the great God. The building is being constructed with large stones, and timber is being laid in the walls. The work is progressing diligently and is advancing successfully under their supervision.

## Ezra 5:9

We questioned the elders, asking them, ‘Who authorised you to rebuild this temple and complete this structure?’

## Ezra 5:10

We also requested their names to inform you, so that we might record the names of the leaders for your knowledge.

## Ezra 5:11

Their response to us was: ‘We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the temple that was constructed many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and completed.

## Ezra 5:12

But because our forefathers angered the God of heaven, He delivered them into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar, the Chaldean king of Babylon, who destroyed this temple and exiled the people to Babylon.

## Ezra 5:13

Nevertheless, in the first year of Cyrus, king of Babylon, King Cyrus issued a decree to rebuild this house of God.

## Ezra 5:14

Moreover, the gold and silver articles of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to the temple in Babylon, King Cyrus retrieved from the temple of Babylon and entrusted to a man named Sheshbazzar, whom he had appointed governor.

## Ezra 5:15

He instructed him, “Take these articles and deposit them in the temple in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be rebuilt on its original site.”

## Ezra 5:16

Thus, Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of the house of God in Jerusalem; and from that time until now, it has been under construction, although it is not yet completed.’

## Ezra 5:17

Therefore, if it pleases the king, let a search be conducted in the royal archives there in Babylon to determine whether a decree was indeed issued by King Cyrus to rebuild this house of God in Jerusalem; and let the king send us his decision regarding this matter.”
