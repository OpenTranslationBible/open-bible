## Nahum 1:1

A pronouncement regarding Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.

## Nahum 1:2

> The Lord is a jealous and avenging God;
> He is filled with wrath
> and takes vengeance on His adversaries.
> The Lord reserves His wrath for His enemies.

## Nahum 1:3

> The Lord is slow to anger and mighty in power;
> He will not leave the guilty unpunished.
> His path is in the whirlwind and storm,
> and clouds are the dust beneath His feet.

## Nahum 1:4

> He rebukes the sea and dries it up;
> He dries up all the rivers.
> Bashan and Carmel wither,
> and the blossoms of Lebanon fade.

## Nahum 1:5

> The mountains quake before Him,
> and the hills melt away.
> The earth trembles at His presence,
> the world and all its inhabitants.

## Nahum 1:6

> Who can withstand His indignation?
> Who can endure the burning of His anger?
> His wrath is poured out like fire,
> and the rocks are shattered before Him.

## Nahum 1:7

> The Lord is good,
> a stronghold in times of trouble;
> He knows those who seek refuge in Him.

## Nahum 1:8

> But with an overwhelming flood,
> He will make an end of its place
> and pursue His foes into darkness.

## Nahum 1:9

> Whatever is devised against the Lord,
> He will bring to an end;
> distress will not arise a second time.

## Nahum 1:10

> They will be entangled among thorns
> and drunk from their wine;
> they will be consumed
> like dry stubble.

## Nahum 1:11

> From you, Nineveh, has come forth
> one who plots evil against the Lord,
> a wicked counsellor.

## Nahum 1:12

This is what the Lord says:

> “Though they are at full strength and numerous,
> they will be cut off and pass away.
> Though I have afflicted you, Judah,
> I will afflict you no more.

## Nahum 1:13

> Now I will break their yoke from your neck
> and tear your shackles apart.”

## Nahum 1:14

> The Lord has given a command concerning you, Nineveh:

> “Your name will no longer be perpetuated.
> I will destroy the carved images
> and idols in the temple of your gods.
> I will prepare your grave,
> for you are contemptible.”

## Nahum 1:15

> Behold, on the mountains, the feet of one who brings good news,
> who proclaims peace! Celebrate your festivals, Judah,
> and fulfil your vows.
> Never again will the wicked invade you;
> they are completely destroyed.
