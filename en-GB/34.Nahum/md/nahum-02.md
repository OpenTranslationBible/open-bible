# Nahum Chapter 2

## Nahum 2:1

> The one who scatters has come up against you.  
> Keep watch over the fortress,  
> Watch the road;  
> Strengthen your back,  
> Summon all your strength.

## Nahum 2:2

> For the Lord will restore the splendour of Jacob  
> Like the splendour of Israel,  
> Even though destroyers have laid waste to them  
> And ruined their vines.

## Nahum 2:3

> The shields of his warriors are dyed red,  
> The warriors are dressed in scarlet,  
> The chariots are fitted with flashing steel  
> When he is prepared to march,  
> And the juniper spears are brandished.

## Nahum 2:4

> The chariots race madly in the streets,  
> They rush wildly in the public squares;  
> Their appearance is like torches,  
> They dash to and fro like lightning flashes.

## Nahum 2:5

> He remembers his nobles;  
> They stumble in their march,  
> They hurry to her wall,  
> And the mantelet is prepared.

## Nahum 2:6

> The gates of the rivers are opened,  
> And the palace sways back and forth.

## Nahum 2:7

> It is determined:  
> She has been stripped, she has been carried away,  
> And her slave women are moaning like the sound of doves,  
> Beating their breasts.

## Nahum 2:8

> Though Nineveh was like a pool of water throughout her days,  
> Now they are fleeing;  
> “Stop, stop,”  
> But no one turns back.

## Nahum 2:9

> Plunder the silver,  
> Plunder the gold!  
> For there is no end to the treasure—  
> Wealth from every kind of desirable object.

## Nahum 2:10

> She is emptied! Yes, she is desolate and waste!  
> Hearts are melting and knees are wobbling!  
> Trembling is in all loins!  
> All faces have turned pale!

## Nahum 2:11

> Where is the den of the lions  
> And the feeding place of the young lions,  
> Where the lion, lioness, and lion’s cub prowled,  
> With nothing to disturb them?

## Nahum 2:12

> The lion tore enough for his cubs,  
> Killed enough for his lionesses,  
> And filled his lairs with prey  
> And his dens with torn flesh.

## Nahum 2:13

> “Behold, I am against you,” declares the Lord of armies.  
> “I will burn up her chariots in smoke,  
> A sword will devour your young lions;  
> I will eliminate your prey from the land,  
> And no longer will the voice of your messengers be heard.”
