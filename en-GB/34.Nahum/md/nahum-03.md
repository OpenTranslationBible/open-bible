# Nahum Chapter 3

## Nahum 3:1

> Alas for the city of bloodshed, filled with deceit and plunder;  
> Her prey never departs.

## Nahum 3:2

> The sound of the whip,  
> The sound of the roaring of the wheel,  
> Galloping horses  
> And bounding chariots!

## Nahum 3:3

> Horsemen charging,  
> Swords flashing, spears gleaming,  
> Many slain, a mass of corpses,  
> And there is no end to the dead bodies—  
> They stumble over the dead bodies!

## Nahum 3:4

> All because of the many acts of prostitution of the prostitute,  
> The charming one, the mistress of sorceries,  
> Who sells nations by her prostitution,  
> And families by her sorceries.

## Nahum 3:5

> “Behold, I am against you,” declares the Lord of armies;  
> “And I will lift up your skirts over your face,  
> And display your nakedness to the nations,  
> And your shame to the kingdoms.

## Nahum 3:6

> I will heap disgrace upon you  
> And make you contemptible,  
> And set you up as a spectacle.

## Nahum 3:7

> And it will come about that all who see you  
> Will shrink from you and say,  
> ‘Nineveh is devastated!  
> Who will show sympathy to her?’  
> Where shall I seek comforters for you?”

## Nahum 3:8

> Are you better than No-amon,  
> Which was situated by the canals of the Nile,  
> Surrounded by waters,  
> Whose rampart was the sea,  
> Whose wall consisted of the sea?

## Nahum 3:9

> Cush was her strength, also Egypt without limits.  
> Put and Lubim were among her helpers.

## Nahum 3:10

> Yet she became an exile,  
> She went into captivity;  
> Also her small children were smashed to pieces  
> At the head of every street;  
> They cast lots for her honourable men,  
> And all her great men were bound with shackles.

## Nahum 3:11

> You too will be overcome,  
> You will be concealed.  
> You too will seek shelter from the enemy.

## Nahum 3:12

> All your fortifications are like fig trees with ripe fruit—  
> When shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater.

## Nahum 3:13

> Behold, your people are defenceless within you!  
> The gates of your land are opened wide to your enemies;  
> Fire consumes your gate bars.

## Nahum 3:14

> Draw water for yourself for the siege!  
> Strengthen your fortifications!  
> Go into the clay and tread the mortar!  
> Take hold of the brick mould!

## Nahum 3:15

> There fire will consume you,  
> The sword will cut you down;  
> It will consume you like the locust.  
> Multiply yourself like the creeping locust,  
> Multiply yourself like the migratory locust.

## Nahum 3:16

> You have made your traders more numerous than the stars of the sky—  
> The creeping locust sheds its skin and flies away.

## Nahum 3:17

> Your courtiers are like the locusts,  
> Your officials like the swarm of locusts  
> That encamp in the stone walls on a cold day—  
> The sun rises, and they flee,  
> And the place where they are is not known.

## Nahum 3:18

> Your shepherds are sleeping, king of Assyria;  
> Your nobles are lying down.  
> Your people are scattered on the mountains,  
> And there is no one to gather them.

## Nahum 3:19

> There is no relief for your collapse,  
> Your wound is incurable.  
> All who hear about you  
> Will clap their hands over you,  
> For upon whom has your evil not passed continually?
