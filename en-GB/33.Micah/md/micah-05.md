## Micah 5:1

> Now muster yourselves in troops, daughter of troops;  
> They have laid siege against us;  
> With a rod they will strike the judge of Israel  
> On the cheek.

## Micah 5:2

> “But as for you, Bethlehem Ephrathah,  
> Too little to be among the clans of Judah,  
> From you One will come forth for Me to be ruler in Israel.  
> His times of coming forth are from long ago,  
> From the days of eternity.”

## Micah 5:3

> Therefore He will give them up until the time  
> When she who is in labour has given birth.  
> Then the remainder of His kinsmen  
> Will return to the sons of Israel.

## Micah 5:4

> And He will arise and shepherd His flock  
> In the strength of the Lord,  
> In the majesty of the name of the Lord His God.  
> And they will remain,  
> Because at that time He will be great  
> To the ends of the earth.

## Micah 5:5

> And this One will be our peace.  
> When the Assyrian invades our land,  
> When he tramples on our citadels,  
> Then we will raise against him  
> Seven shepherds and eight leaders of people.

## Micah 5:6

> And they will shepherd the land of Assyria with the sword,  
> The land of Nimrod at its entrances;  
> And He will rescue us from the Assyrian  
> When he invades our land  
> And tramples our territory.

## Micah 5:7

> Then the remnant of Jacob  
> Will be among many peoples  
> Like dew from the Lord,  
> Like showers on vegetation  
> That do not wait for man,  
> Or delay for mankind.

## Micah 5:8

> The remnant of Jacob  
> Will be among the nations,  
> Among many peoples  
> Like a lion among the animals of the forest,  
> Like a young lion among flocks of sheep,  
> Which, if he passes through,  
> Tramples and tears,  
> And there is no rescuer.

## Micah 5:9

> Your hand will be raised against your adversaries,  
> And all your enemies will be eliminated.

## Micah 5:10

“And it will be on that day,” declares the Lord,

> “That I will eliminate your horses from among you  
> And destroy your chariots.

## Micah 5:11

> I will also eliminate the cities of your land  
> And tear down all your fortresses.

## Micah 5:12

> I will eliminate sorceries from your hand,  
> And you will have no fortune-tellers.

## Micah 5:13

> I will eliminate your carved images  
> And your memorial stones from among you,  
> So that you will no longer bow down  
> To the work of your hands.

## Micah 5:14

> I will uproot your Asherim from among you  
> And destroy your cities.

## Micah 5:15

> And I will execute vengeance in anger and wrath  
> On the nations that have not obeyed.”
