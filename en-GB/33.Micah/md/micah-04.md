# Micah Chapter 4

## Micah 4:1

And it shall come to pass in the latter days

> That the mountain of the house of the Lord  
> Will be established as the foremost of the mountains.  
> It will be elevated above the hills,  
> And the peoples will flow to it.

## Micah 4:2

And many nations will come and say,

> “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord  
> And to the house of the God of Jacob,  
> So that He may teach us about His ways,  
> And that we may walk in His paths.”  
> For from Zion will go forth the law,  
> And the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.

## Micah 4:3

> And He will judge between many peoples  
> And render decisions for mighty, distant nations.  
> Then they will beat their swords into ploughshares,  
> And their spears into pruning hooks;  
> Nation will not lift up a sword against nation,  
> And never again will they train for war.

## Micah 4:4

> Each one will sit under their vine  
> And under their fig tree,  
> With no one to make them afraid,  
> For the mouth of the Lord of hosts has spoken.

## Micah 4:5

> Although all the peoples walk,  
> Each in the name of their own god,  
> We will walk  
> In the name of the Lord our God forever and ever.

## Micah 4:6

“At that time,” declares the Lord,

> “I will gather those who are lame  
> And collect the dispersed,  
> Those whom I have brought low.

## Micah 4:7

> I will make those who are lame a remnant,  
> And those who have wandered a mighty nation,  
> And the Lord will reign over them on Mount Zion  
> From this time forth and forevermore.

## Micah 4:8

> As for you, tower of the flock,  
> Hill of the daughter of Zion,  
> To you it shall come—  
> Indeed, the former dominion will return,  
> The kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.

## Micah 4:9

> Now, why do you cry out loudly?  
> Is there no king among you,  
> Or has your counsellor perished,  
> That agony has gripped you like a woman in childbirth?

## Micah 4:10

> Writhe and cry out, daughter of Zion,  
> Like a woman in childbirth;  
> For now you will leave the city,  
> Dwell in the field,  
> And go to Babylon.  
> There you will be delivered,  
> There the Lord will redeem you  
> From the hand of your enemies.

## Micah 4:11

> And now many nations have gathered against you  
> Who say, “Let her be defiled,  
> And let our eyes gloat over Zion!”

## Micah 4:12

> But they do not know the intentions of the Lord,  
> And they do not understand His purpose;  
> For He has brought them together like sheaves to the threshing floor.

## Micah 4:13

> Arise and thresh, daughter of Zion,  
> For I will make your horn iron,  
> And I will make your hooves bronze,  
> So that you may crush many peoples,  
> And dedicate to the Lord their unjust gain,  
> And their wealth to the Lord of the whole earth.
