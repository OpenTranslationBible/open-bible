The word of the Lord which came to Micah of Moresheth in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw regarding Samaria and Jerusalem.

## Micah 1:2

> Hear, you peoples, all of you;  
> Listen carefully, earth and all it contains,  
> And may the Lord God be a witness against you,  
> The Lord from His holy temple.

## Micah 1:3

> For behold, the Lord is coming out of His place.  
> He will come down and tread on the high places of the earth.

## Micah 1:4

> The mountains will melt under Him,  
> And the valleys will split like wax before the fire,  
> Like water poured down a steep place.

## Micah 1:5

> All this is due to the wrongdoing of Jacob  
> And the sins of the house of Israel.  
> What is the wrongdoing of Jacob? Is it not Samaria?  
> What is the high place of Judah? Is it not Jerusalem?

## Micah 1:6

> For I will make Samaria a heap of ruins in the open country,  
> Planting places for a vineyard.  
> And I will hurl her stones into the valley,  
> And lay bare her foundations.

## Micah 1:7

> All of her idols will be smashed,  
> All of her earnings will be burned with fire,  
> And all of her images I will make desolate;  
> For she collected them from a prostitute’s earnings,  
> And to the earnings of a prostitute they will return.

## Micah 1:8

> Because of this I must mourn and wail,  
> I must go barefoot and naked;  
> I must do mourning like the jackals,  
> And a mourning like ostriches.

## Micah 1:9

> For her wounds are incurable,  
> For it has come to Judah;  
> It has reached the gate of My people,  
> Even to Jerusalem.

## Micah 1:10

> Do not tell it in Gath,  
> Do not weep at all.  
> At Beth-le-aphrah roll yourself in the dust.

## Micah 1:11

> Go on your way, inhabitant of Shaphir, in shameful nakedness.  
> The inhabitant of Zaanan does not escape.  
> The mourning of Beth-ezel: “He will take its support from you.”

## Micah 1:12

> For the inhabitant of Maroth  
> Waits for good, but disaster has come down from the Lord  
> To the gate of Jerusalem.

## Micah 1:13

> Harness the chariot to the team of horses,  
> You inhabitant of Lachish—  
> She was the beginning of sin  
> To the daughter of Zion—  
> Because in you were found  
> The rebellious acts of Israel.

## Micah 1:14

> Therefore you will give parting gifts  
> On behalf of Moresheth-gath;  
> The houses of Achzib will become a deception  
> To the kings of Israel.

## Micah 1:15

> Moreover, I will bring on you  
> The one who takes possession,  
> You inhabitant of Mareshah.  
> The glory of Israel will enter Adullam.

## Micah 1:16

> Shave yourself bald, cut off your hair,  
> For the children of your delight;  
> Extend your baldness like the eagle,  
> For they will go from you into exile.
