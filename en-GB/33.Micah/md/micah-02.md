# Micah Chapter 2

## Micah 2:1

> Alas for those who plan mischief,  
> Who engage in wrongdoing while in bed!  
> When dawn arrives, they carry it out,  
> Because it is within their power to do so.

## Micah 2:2

> They covet fields and then seize them,  
> And houses, and take them;  
> They exploit a man and his house,  
> A person and his inheritance.

## Micah 2:3

> Therefore, this is what the Lord says:  
> “Behold, I am planning against this family a disaster  
> From which you cannot remove your necks;  
> And you will not walk with haughtiness,  
> For it will be an evil time.

## Micah 2:4

> On that day they will take up against you a song of mocking  
> And utter a song of mourning and say,  
> ‘We are completely destroyed!  
> He exchanges the portion of my people;  
> How He removes it from me!  
> To the apostate He apportions our fields.’

## Micah 2:5

> Therefore you will have no one who apportions land by lot  
> In the assembly of the Lord.

## Micah 2:6

> ‘Do not prophesy,’ they say.  
> Yet if they refrain from prophesying about these matters,  
> Insults will not be turned back.”

## Micah 2:7

> Is it being said, house of Jacob:  
> “Is the Spirit of the Lord impatient?  
> Are these His deeds?”  
> Do My words not do good  
> For the one walking rightly?

## Micah 2:8

> Lately, My people have risen as adversaries—  
> You remove the robe from the garment  
> Of unsuspecting passers-by,  
> From those returned from war.

## Micah 2:9

> You evict the women of My people  
> From their pleasant houses.  
> From their children you take My splendour  
> Forever.

## Micah 2:10

> Arise and go,  
> For this is no place of rest  
> Because of the uncleanness that brings destruction,  
> A painful destruction.

## Micah 2:11

> If someone pursuing emptiness and deceit were to lie and say,  
> “I will prophesy to you about wine and strong drink,”  
> He would become a prophet to this people.

## Micah 2:12

> I will certainly gather all of you, Jacob,  
> I will certainly gather the remnant of Israel.  
> I will put them together like sheep in the fold;  
> Like a flock in the midst of its pasture  
> They will be noisy with people.

## Micah 2:13

> The one who opens the way goes up before them;  
> They break through, pass through the gate, and go out by it.  
> So their king advances before them,  
> And the Lord leads them.”
