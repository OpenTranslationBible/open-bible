# Micah Chapter 2

## Micah 2:1

> Woe to those who devise wrongdoing,  
> Who practice evil on their beds!  
> When morning comes, they do it,  
> Because it is in the power of their hands.

## Micah 2:2

> They covet fields and then seize them,  
> And houses, and take them;  
> They exploit a man and his house,  
> A person and his inheritance.

## Micah 2:3

> Therefore, this is what the Lord says:  
> “Behold, I am planning against this family a disaster  
> From which you cannot remove your necks;  
> And you will not walk with haughtiness,  
> For it will be an evil time.

## Micah 2:4

> On that day they will take up against you a song of mocking  
> And utter a song of mourning and say,  
> ‘We are completely destroyed!  
> He exchanges the portion of my people;  
> How He removes it from me!  
> To the apostate He apportions our fields.’

## Micah 2:5

> Therefore you will have no one who apportions land by lot  
> In the assembly of the Lord.

## Micah 2:6

> ‘Do not prophesy,’ so they prophesy.  
> But if they do not prophesy about these things,  
> Insults will not be turned back.”

## Micah 2:7

> Is it being said, house of Jacob:  
> “Is the Spirit of the Lord impatient?  
> Are these His deeds?”  
> Do My words not do good  
> For the one walking rightly?

## Micah 2:8

> Recently My people have arisen as an enemy—  
> You strip the robe off the garment  
> From unsuspecting passers-by,  
> From those returned from war.

## Micah 2:9

> You evict the women of My people  
> From their pleasant houses.  
> From their children you take My splendour  
> Forever.

## Micah 2:10

> Arise and go,  
> For this is no place of rest  
> Because of the uncleanness that brings destruction,  
> A painful destruction.

## Micah 2:11

> If someone walking after wind and falsehood had lied and said,  
> “I will prophesy to you about wine and liquor,”  
> He would become a prophet to this people.

## Micah 2:12

> I will certainly gather all of you, Jacob,  
> I will certainly gather the remnant of Israel.  
> I will put them together like sheep in the fold;  
> Like a flock in the midst of its pasture  
> They will be noisy with people.

## Micah 2:13

> The one who breaks through goes up before them;  
> They break through, pass through the gate, and go out by it.  
> So their king passes on before them,  
> And the Lord at their head.
