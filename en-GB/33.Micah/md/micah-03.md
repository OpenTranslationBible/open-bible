# Micah Chapter 3

## Micah 3:1

> And I said,  
> “Hear now, you heads of Jacob  
> And rulers of the house of Israel.  
> Is it not for you to know justice?

## Micah 3:2

> You who detest goodness and embrace wickedness,  
> Who strip away their skin  
> And their flesh from their bones,

## Micah 3:3

> Who eat the flesh of my people,  
> Strip off their skin from them,  
> Crush their bones,  
> And chop them up as for the pot  
> And as meat in a cauldron!”

## Micah 3:4

> Then they will call out to the Lord,  
> But He will not respond to them.  
> Instead, He will turn His face away from them at that time  
> Because they have engaged in evil actions.

## Micah 3:5

> This is what the Lord says concerning the prophets who lead my people astray:  
> When they have something to bite with their teeth,  
> They call out, “Peace,”  
> But against the one who does not put anything in their mouths  
> They declare holy war.

## Micah 3:6

> Therefore it will be night for you—without vision,  
> And darkness for you—without divination.  
> The sun will set on the prophets,  
> And the day will become dark over them.

## Micah 3:7

> The seers will be put to shame,  
> And the diviners will be ashamed.  
> Indeed, they will all cover their mouths  
> Because there is no answer from God.

## Micah 3:8

> On the other hand, I am filled with power—  
> With the Spirit of the Lord—  
> And with justice and courage  
> To declare to Jacob his wrongdoing,  
> And to Israel his sin.

## Micah 3:9

> Now listen to this, you heads of the house of Jacob  
> And rulers of the house of Israel,  
> Who scorn justice  
> And distort what is upright,

## Micah 3:10

> Who construct Zion with violence,  
> And Jerusalem with iniquity.

## Micah 3:11

> Her leaders pronounce judgement for a bribe,  
> Her priests teach for pay,  
> And her prophets divine for money.  
> Yet they lean on the Lord, saying,  
> “Is the Lord not in our midst?  
> Catastrophe will not come upon us.”

## Micah 3:12

> Therefore, on account of you  
> Zion will be ploughed like a field,  
> Jerusalem will become a heap of ruins,  
> And the mountain of the temple will become high places of a forest.
