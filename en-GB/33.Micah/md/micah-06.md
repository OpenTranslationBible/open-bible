# Micah Chapter 6

## Micah 6:1

Hear now what the Lord is saying:

> “Arise, plead your case before the mountains,  
> And have the hills hear your voice.”

## Micah 6:2

> Pay attention, you mountains, to the Lord's charge,  
> And you everlasting foundations of the earth,  
> For the Lord has a grievance with His people,  
> And He will contend with Israel.

## Micah 6:3

> My people, what have I done to you,  
> And in what way have I burdened you? Respond to Me.

## Micah 6:4

> Truly, I brought you up from the land of Egypt,  
> I freed you from the house of bondage,  
> And I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.

## Micah 6:5

> My people, recall now  
> What Balak king of Moab devised,  
> And how Balaam son of Beor responded to him,  
> And what occurred from Shittim to Gilgal,  
> So that you might understand the righteous deeds of the Lord.”

## Micah 6:6

> With what shall I approach the Lord  
> And bow myself before the God on high?  
> Shall I come to Him with burnt offerings,  
> With year-old calves?

## Micah 6:7

> Does the Lord delight in thousands of rams,  
> In ten thousand rivers of oil?  
> Shall I offer my firstborn for my transgression,  
> The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?

## Micah 6:8

> He has shown you, mortal one, what is good;  
> And what does the Lord ask of you  
> But to act justly, to love mercy,  
> And to walk humbly with your God?

## Micah 6:9

> The voice of the Lord will call to the city—  
> And it is wise to revere Your name:  
> “Listen, you tribe. Who has appointed its time?

## Micah 6:10

> Is there still someone in the wicked house,  
> With treasures of iniquity,  
> And a short measure that is cursed?

## Micah 6:11

> Can I tolerate dishonest scales,  
> And a bag of deceitful weights?

## Micah 6:12

> For the wealthy of the city are full of violence,  
> Her inhabitants speak falsehoods,  
> And their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.

## Micah 6:13

> Therefore I will make you ill, striking you down,  
> Rendering you desolate because of your sins.

## Micah 6:14

> You will eat, but you will not be satisfied,  
> And your emptiness will remain within you.  
> You will try to secure valuables,  
> But you will not save them all,  
> And what you do save I will hand over to the sword.

## Micah 6:15

> You will sow, but you will not reap.  
> You will tread the olive press, but will not anoint yourself with oil;  
> And tread grapes, but you will not drink wine.

## Micah 6:16

> The decrees of Omri  
> And all the practices of the house of Ahab are upheld,  
> And you follow their counsels.  
> Therefore I will deliver you to ruin,  
> And your inhabitants to scorn,  
> And you will endure the mockery of My people.”
