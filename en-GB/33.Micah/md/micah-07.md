# Micah Chapter 7

## Micah 7:1

> Woe to me! For I am  
> Like harvests of summer fruit, like gleanings of the grape harvest:  
> There is not a cluster of grapes to eat,  
> Nor a ripe fig that I crave.

## Micah 7:2

> The godly person has perished from the land,  
> And there is no one upright among mankind.  
> All of them lie in wait for bloodshed;  
> Each of them hunts the other with a net.

## Micah 7:3

> As for evil, both hands do it well.  
> The leader asks for a bribe,  
> Also the judge, and the great man speaks the desire of his soul—  
> So they plot it together.

## Micah 7:4

> The best of them is like a thorn bush,  
> The most upright like a thorn hedge.  
> The day when you post your watchmen,  
> Your punishment is coming.  
> Then their confusion will occur.

## Micah 7:5

> Do not trust in a neighbour;  
> Do not have confidence in a close friend.  
> Guard the doors of your mouth  
> From her who lies in your arms.

## Micah 7:6

> To set a son against his father,  
> a daughter against her mother,  
> and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;  
> A person’s enemies are the people of his own household.

## Micah 7:7

> But as for me, I will watch expectantly for the Lord;  
> I will wait for the God of my salvation.  
> My God will hear me.

## Micah 7:8

> Do not rejoice over me, enemy of mine.  
> Though I fall I will rise;  
> Though I live in darkness, the Lord is a light for me.

## Micah 7:9

> I will endure the indignation of the Lord  
> Because I have sinned against Him,  
> Until He pleads my case and executes justice for me.  
> He will bring me out to the light,  
> And I will look at His righteousness.

## Micah 7:10

> Then my enemy will see,  
> And shame will cover her who said to me,  
> “Where is the Lord your God?”  
> My eyes will look at her;  
> At that time she will be trampled down  
> Like mud of the streets.

## Micah 7:11

> It will be a day for building your walls.  
> On that day your boundary will be extended.

## Micah 7:12

> It will be a day when people will come to you  
> From Assyria and the cities of Egypt,  
> From Egypt even to the Euphrates,  
> Even from sea to sea and mountain to mountain.

## Micah 7:13

> And the earth will become a wasteland because of her inhabitants,  
> On account of the fruit of their deeds.

## Micah 7:14

> Shepherd Your people with Your sceptre,  
> The flock of Your possession  
> Which lives by itself in the woodland,  
> In the midst of a fruitful field.  
> Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead  
> As in the days of old.

## Micah 7:15

> As in the days when you went out from the land of Egypt,  
> I will show you miracles.

## Micah 7:16

> Nations will see and be ashamed  
> Of all their might.  
> They will put their hand on their mouth,  
> Their ears will become deaf.

## Micah 7:17

> They will lick the dust like a snake,  
> Like reptiles of the earth.  
> They will come trembling out of their fortresses;  
> To the Lord our God they will come in trepidation,  
> And they will be afraid of You.

## Micah 7:18

> Who is a God like You,  
> Who pardons wrongdoing  
> And passes over a rebellious act of the remnant of His possession?  
> He does not retain His anger forever,  
> Because He delights in mercy.

## Micah 7:19

> He will again take pity on us;  
> He will trample on our wrongdoings.  
> Yes, You will cast all their sins  
> Into the depths of the sea.

## Micah 7:20

> You will give truth to Jacob  
> And favour to Abraham,  
> Which You swore to our forefathers  
> From the days of old.
