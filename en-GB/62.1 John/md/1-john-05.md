# 1 John Chapter 5

## 1 John 5:1

Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the Father loves the child born of Him.

## 1 John 5:2

By this we know that we love the children of God: when we love God and follow His commandments.

## 1 John 5:3

For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments; and His commandments are not burdensome.

## 1 John 5:4

For whoever has been born of God overcomes the world; and this is the victory that has overcome the world: our faith.

## 1 John 5:5

Who is the one who overcomes the world, but the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?

## 1 John 5:6

This is the One who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ; not with the water only, but with the water and the blood. It is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.

## 1 John 5:7

For there are three that testify:

## 1 John 5:8

the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and the three are in agreement.

## 1 John 5:9

If we accept the testimony of people, the testimony of God is greater; for the testimony of God is this, that He has testified concerning His Son.

## 1 John 5:10

The one who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself; the one who does not believe God has made Him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given concerning His Son.

## 1 John 5:11

And the testimony is this, that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son.

## 1 John 5:12

The one who has the Son has the life; the one who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.

## 1 John 5:13

These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life.

## 1 John 5:14

This is the confidence which we have before Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us.

## 1 John 5:15

And if we know that He hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests which we have asked from Him.

## 1 John 5:16

If anyone sees his brother or sister committing a sin not leading to death, he shall ask and God will, for him, give life to those who commit sin not leading to death. There is sin leading to death; I am not saying that he should make request for that.

## 1 John 5:17

All unrighteousness is sin, and there is sin not leading to death.

## 1 John 5:18

We know that no one who has been born of God sins continually; but He who was born of God keeps him, and the evil one does not touch him.

## 1 John 5:19

We know that we are of God, and that the whole world lies in the power of the evil one.

## 1 John 5:20

And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life.

## 1 John 5:21

Little children, guard yourselves from idols.
