# 1 John Chapter 5

## 1 John 5:1

Anyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and whoever loves the Father loves the child born of Him.

## 1 John 5:2

This is how we know that we love the children of God: when we love God and obey His commandments.

## 1 John 5:3

For this is how we demonstrate our love of God: by keeping His commandments; and His commandments are not burdensome.

## 1 John 5:4

For anyone born of God triumphs over the world; and our faith is the victory that has conquered the world.

## 1 John 5:5

Who is it that triumphs over the world, but the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?

## 1 John 5:6

This is the One who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ; not with the water only, but with the water and the blood. It is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.

## 1 John 5:7

For there are three that bear witness:

## 1 John 5:8

the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and the three are in harmony.

## 1 John 5:9

If we accept the testimony of people, the testimony of God is greater; for the testimony of God is this, that He has testified concerning His Son.

## 1 John 5:10

The believer in the Son of God has the testimony within; the one who does not believe God has made Him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has provided concerning His Son.

## 1 John 5:11

And this is the testimony: God has granted us eternal life, and this life is in His Son.

## 1 John 5:12

Those who have the Son possess life; those who do not have the Son of God do not possess life.

## 1 John 5:13

I have written these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you possess eternal life.

## 1 John 5:14

This is the assurance we have before Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He listens to us.

## 1 John 5:15

And if we know that He listens to us in whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests we have made of Him.

## 1 John 5:16

If anyone sees his brother or sister committing a sin not leading to death, he shall ask and God will, for him, grant life to those who commit sin not leading to death. There is sin leading to death; I am not saying that he should make request for that.

## 1 John 5:17

All wrongdoing is sin, and there is sin not leading to death.

## 1 John 5:18

We know that no one born of God continues to sin; but He who was born of God keeps him, and the evil one does not touch him.

## 1 John 5:19

We know that we belong to God, and that the whole world is under the sway of the evil one.

## 1 John 5:20

And we are aware that the Son of God has come and has provided us with understanding, so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life.

## 1 John 5:21

Dear children, keep yourselves from idols.
