# 1 John Chapter 1

## 1 John 1:1

What existed from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we have observed and touched with our hands, concerning the Word of Life—

## 1 John 1:2

and the life was made known, and we have seen and testify and declare to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was made known to us—

## 1 John 1:3

what we have seen and heard we declare to you also, so that you too may share in fellowship with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ.

## 1 John 1:4

We write these things, so that our joy may be complete.

## 1 John 1:5

This is the message we have received from Him and declare to you, that God is Light, and in Him there is no darkness at all.

## 1 John 1:6

If we claim to have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we are not truthful and do not practice the truth;

## 1 John 1:7

but if we walk in the Light as He Himself is in the Light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son purifies us from all sin.

## 1 John 1:8

If we claim to be without sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us.

## 1 John 1:9

If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just, so that He will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.

## 1 John 1:10

If we claim we have not sinned, we make Him a liar and His word is not in us.
