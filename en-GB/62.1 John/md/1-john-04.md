# 1 John Chapter 4

## 1 John 4:1

Dear friends, do not trust every spirit, but examine the spirits to determine if they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world.

## 1 John 4:2

This is how you can recognise the Spirit of God: every spirit that acknowledges Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God;

## 1 John 4:3

and every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God; this is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming, and now it is already in the world.

## 1 John 4:4

You belong to God, dear children, and have overcome them; because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world.

## 1 John 4:5

They originate from the world; therefore they speak from the world's perspective, and the world listens to them.

## 1 John 4:6

We are of God. Whoever knows God listens to us; whoever is not from God does not listen to us. By this we recognise the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.

## 1 John 4:7

Dear friends, let us love each other, for love is from God; and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God.

## 1 John 4:8

Anyone who does not love has not come to know God, because God is love.

## 1 John 4:9

This is how the love of God was revealed among us: God sent His only Son into the world so that we might live through Him.

## 1 John 4:10

This is love: not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins.

## 1 John 4:11

Dear beloved, since God has loved us in such a way, we should also love one another.

## 1 John 4:12

No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God lives in us, and His love is made complete in us.

## 1 John 4:13

By this we know that we live in Him and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit.

## 1 John 4:14

We have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.

## 1 John 4:15

Whoever acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in him, and he in God.

## 1 John 4:16

We have come to know and believe the love that God has for us. God is love, and whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.

## 1 John 4:17

By this, love is made complete among us, so that we may have confidence on the day of judgement, because as He is, so are we in this world.

## 1 John 4:18

There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves punishment, and the one who fears is not made perfect in love.

## 1 John 4:19

We love because He first loved us.

## 1 John 4:20

If someone says, “I love God,” and yet hates his brother or sister, he is a liar; for the one who does not love his brother or sister whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen.

## 1 John 4:21

And this is the commandment we have from Him: that the one who loves God must also love his brother and sister.
