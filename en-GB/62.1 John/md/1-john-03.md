# 1 John Chapter 3

## 1 John 3:1

Observe the wonderful love the Father has bestowed upon us, that we should be called children of God; and indeed we are. This is why the world does not recognise us: because it did not recognise Him.

## 1 John 3:2

Dear friends, now we are children of God, and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be. We know that when He is revealed, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He truly is.

## 1 John 3:3

And everyone who holds this hope in Him strives for purity, just as He is pure.

## 1 John 3:4

Everyone who commits sin also commits lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness.

## 1 John 3:5

You are aware that He appeared to take away sins; and in Him there is no sin.

## 1 John 3:6

No one who abides in Him continues to sin; no one who continues to sin has seen Him or knows Him.

## 1 John 3:7

Little children, let no one lead you astray; the one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous;

## 1 John 3:8

the one who commits sin is of the devil; for the devil has been sinning from the start. The Son of God appeared for this reason, to undo the works of the devil.

## 1 John 3:9

No one who is born of God continues to sin, because His seed abides in him; and he cannot continue to sin, because he is born of God.

## 1 John 3:10

By this the children of God and the children of the devil are evident: anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who does not love his brother or sister.

## 1 John 3:11

For this is the message you have heard right from the start: that we should love one another;

## 1 John 3:12

not like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and killed his brother. And why did he kill him? Because his own actions were evil, while his brotherâ€™s were righteous.

## 1 John 3:13

Do not be astonished, brothers and sisters, if the world hates you.

## 1 John 3:14

We know that we have transitioned from death to life, because we love our brothers and sisters. Whoever does not love remains in death.

## 1 John 3:15

Everyone who hates his brother or sister is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.

## 1 John 3:16

We understand love by this, that He laid down His life for us; and we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters.

## 1 John 3:17

But whoever has material possessions and sees his brother or sister in need, and closes his heart against them, how can the love of God abide in him?

## 1 John 3:18

Little children, let us not love with words or speech, but with actions and in truth.

## 1 John 3:19

By this we shall know that we are of the truth, and shall reassure our hearts before Him,

## 1 John 3:20

that if our hearts condemn us, God is greater than our hearts, and He knows all things.

## 1 John 3:21

Dear friends, if our hearts are at peace, we have confidence before God;

## 1 John 3:22

and whatever we ask, we receive from Him, because we follow His commandments and do what is pleasing to Him.

## 1 John 3:23

This is His commandment, that we believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, just as He instructed us.

## 1 John 3:24

The one who observes His commandments remains in Him, and He in him. We know by this that He remains in us, by the Spirit whom He has given us.
