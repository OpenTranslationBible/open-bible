# Philemon Chapter 1

## Philemon 1:1
Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved friend and fellow worker—

## Philemon 1:2
to Apphia our sister, and Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church that meets in your house:

## Philemon 1:3
Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

## Philemon 1:4
I always thank my God, making mention of you in my prayers,

## Philemon 1:5
because I hear of your love and faith which you have towards the Lord Jesus and all the saints.

## Philemon 1:6
I pray that the fellowship of your faith may become effective through the understanding of every good thing we share for the sake of Christ.

## Philemon 1:7
Your love has brought me great joy and comfort, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the saints.

## Philemon 1:8
Therefore, although I have enough confidence in Christ to command you to do what is proper,

## Philemon 1:9
yet for love’s sake I prefer to appeal to you—being such a one as Paul, an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus—

## Philemon 1:10
I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my imprisonment.

## Philemon 1:11
He was formerly useless to you, but now he is useful both to you and to me.

## Philemon 1:12
I am sending him back to you, sending my very heart.

## Philemon 1:13
I would have liked to keep him with me, so that he might serve me on your behalf during my imprisonment for the gospel.

## Philemon 1:14
But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that your goodness would not be by compulsion but of your own free will.

## Philemon 1:15
Perhaps for this reason he was separated from you for a while, that you might have him back forever—

## Philemon 1:16
no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.

## Philemon 1:17
If you consider me a partner, accept him as you would accept me.

## Philemon 1:18
If he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge it to me.

## Philemon 1:19
I, Paul, write this with my own hand—I will repay it—not to mention that you owe me even your own self.

## Philemon 1:20
Yes, brother, let me have some benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ.

## Philemon 1:21
Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask.

## Philemon 1:22
At the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope to be restored to you through your prayers.

## Philemon 1:23
Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings.

## Philemon 1:24
As do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.

## Philemon 1:25
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
