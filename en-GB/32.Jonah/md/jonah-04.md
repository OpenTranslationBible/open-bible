# Jonah Chapter 4

## Jonah 4:1

But it greatly displeased Jonah, and he became angry.

## Jonah 4:2

Then he prayed to the Lord and said,  
“Please Lord, was this not what I said when I was still in my own country?  
Therefore, in anticipation of this I fled to Tarshish,  
Since I knew that You are a gracious and compassionate God,  
Slow to anger and abundant in mercy,  
And one who relents of disaster.

## Jonah 4:3

So now, Lord, please take my life from me,  
For death is better to me than life.”

## Jonah 4:4

But the Lord said,  
“Do you have a good reason to be angry?”

## Jonah 4:5

Then Jonah left the city and sat down east of it. There he made a shelter for himself and sat under it in the shade until he could see what would happen in the city.

## Jonah 4:6

So the Lord God designated a plant, and it grew up over Jonah to be a shade over his head, to relieve him of his discomfort. And Jonah was overjoyed about the plant.

## Jonah 4:7

But God designated a worm when dawn came the next day, and it attacked the plant and it withered.

## Jonah 4:8

And when the sun came up God designated a scorching east wind, and the sun beat down on Jonah’s head so that he became faint, and he begged with all his soul to die, saying,  
“Death is better to me than life!”

## Jonah 4:9

But God said to Jonah,  
“Do you have a good reason to be angry about the plant?”  
And he said,  
“I have good reason to be angry, even to the point of death!”

## Jonah 4:10

Then the Lord said,  
“You had compassion on the plant for which you did not work,  
And which you did not cause to grow,  
Which came up overnight and perished overnight.

## Jonah 4:11

Should I not also have compassion on Nineveh, the great city,  
In which there are more than 120,000 people  
Who do not know the difference between their right and left hand,  
As well as many animals?”
