# Jonah Chapter 4

## Jonah 4:1
But Jonah found this very displeasing, and he became angry.

## Jonah 4:2
He prayed to the Lord, “Is this not what I said, Lord, when I was still in my own country? That is why I tried to prevent it by fleeing to Tarshish. I knew that you are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to anger and rich in love, a God who relents from sending disaster.

## Jonah 4:3
Now, Lord, please take my life from me, for I would rather die than live.”

## Jonah 4:4
But the Lord asked, “Is it right for you to be angry?”

## Jonah 4:5
Jonah went out and sat down at a place east of the city. There he made himself a shelter, sat in its shade, and waited to see what would happen to the city.

## Jonah 4:6
Then the Lord God provided a plant, and it grew up over Jonah to give shade for his head to ease his discomfort, and Jonah was delighted with the plant.

## Jonah 4:7
But at dawn the next day, God provided a worm, which attacked the plant so that it withered.

## Jonah 4:8
When the sun rose, God provided a scorching east wind, and the sun beat down on Jonah’s head so that he became faint. He wished to die, saying, “I would rather die than live.”

## Jonah 4:9
But God said to Jonah, “Is it right for you to be angry about the plant?” “It is,” he replied. “I am so angry I could die.”

## Jonah 4:10
But the Lord said, “You have been concerned about this plant, though you did not labour for it or make it grow. It sprang up overnight and perished overnight.

## Jonah 4:11
And should I not have concern for the great city of Nineveh, where there are more than 120,000 people who cannot tell their right hand from their left, and also many animals?”
