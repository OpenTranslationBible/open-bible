# Jonah Chapter 3

## Jonah 3:1
The word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time, saying,

## Jonah 3:2
“Arise, go to the great city of Nineveh and deliver to it the message that I will give you.”

## Jonah 3:3
Jonah arose and went to Nineveh in accordance with the word of the Lord. Now Nineveh was an exceedingly large city, requiring three days to traverse it.

## Jonah 3:4
Jonah began to enter the city, travelling a day's journey, and he proclaimed, “In forty days Nineveh will be overthrown.”

## Jonah 3:5
The people of Nineveh believed God. They proclaimed a fast and donned sackcloth, from the greatest of them to the least.

## Jonah 3:6
When the news reached the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, removed his royal robe, covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in the dust.

## Jonah 3:7
He issued a proclamation in Nineveh: “By the decree of the king and his nobles: No person or animal, herd or flock, is to taste anything; they must not eat or drink.

## Jonah 3:8
But let every person and animal be covered with sackcloth, and let everyone call upon God earnestly. Let them turn from their evil ways and the violence in their hands.

## Jonah 3:9
Who knows? God may turn and relent, and withdraw His fierce anger, so that we do not perish.”

## Jonah 3:10
When God saw their actions, how they turned from their evil ways, He relented and did not bring upon them the disaster He had threatened.
