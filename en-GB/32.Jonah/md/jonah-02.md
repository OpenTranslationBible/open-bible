# Jonah Chapter 2

## Jonah 2:1

Jonah prayed to the Lord his God from within the belly of the fish,

## Jonah 2:2

saying,

> “In my distress I called to the Lord,
> and He responded to me. From the depths of Sheol
> I cried for help,
> and You heard my voice.

## Jonah 2:3

> You cast me into the deep,
> into the heart of the seas,
> and the currents surrounded me;
> all Your waves and breakers swept over me.

## Jonah 2:4

> I thought, ‘I am driven away from Your sight;
> yet I will look once more toward Your holy temple.’

## Jonah 2:5

> The waters engulfed me to the brink of death,
> the deep encircled me;
> seaweed was wrapped around my head.

## Jonah 2:6

> I sank to the roots of the mountains;
> the earth with its bars closed upon me forever.
> Yet You, Lord my God, brought my life up from the pit.

## Jonah 2:7

> As my life was fading away,
> I remembered the Lord,
> and my prayer reached You,
> into Your holy temple.

## Jonah 2:8

> Those who cling to worthless idols
> forsake their loyalty,

## Jonah 2:9

> but I, with a voice of thanksgiving,
> will sacrifice to You.
> What I have vowed I will fulfil.
> Salvation is from the Lord.”

## Jonah 2:10

Then the Lord spoke to the fish, and it released Jonah onto dry land.
