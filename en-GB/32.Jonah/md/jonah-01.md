# Jonah Chapter 1

## Jonah 1:1

The word of the Lord came to Jonah son of Amittai, saying,

## Jonah 1:2

> “Arise, go to the great city of Nineveh and proclaim against it,
> for their wickedness has come up before me.”

## Jonah 1:3

But Jonah set out to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the Lord. He went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish. After paying the fare, he boarded it to sail with them to Tarshish, away from the presence of the Lord.

## Jonah 1:4

But the Lord sent a mighty wind upon the sea, and there was a violent storm on the sea, so that the ship was in danger of breaking apart.

## Jonah 1:5

The sailors were afraid and each cried out to his own god. They threw the cargo into the sea to lighten the ship. Meanwhile, Jonah had gone down into the stern of the ship, where he lay down and fell into a deep sleep.

## Jonah 1:6

The captain went to him and said,
“How can you sleep? Get up, call on your god! Perhaps your god will notice us so that we will not perish.”

## Jonah 1:7

The sailors said to each other, “Come, let us cast lots to discover who is responsible for this calamity.” They cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah.

## Jonah 1:8

So they asked him, “Tell us, who is responsible for this disaster? What is your occupation? Where do you come from? What is your country? From what people are you?”

## Jonah 1:9

He replied, “I am a Hebrew and I fear the Lord, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land.”

## Jonah 1:10

This terrified them, and they asked, “What have you done?” For they knew he was fleeing from the presence of the Lord, because he had told them.

## Jonah 1:11

The sea was growing more tempestuous. So they asked him, “What should we do to you to make the sea calm down for us?”

## Jonah 1:12

He answered, “Pick me up and throw me into the sea, and it will become calm. I know that it is because of me this great storm has come upon you.”

## Jonah 1:13

Nevertheless, the men rowed hard to return to land, but they could not, for the sea grew even more tempestuous against them.

## Jonah 1:14

Then they cried out to the Lord, “We beseech you, O Lord, do not let us perish for this man’s life, and do not hold us accountable for innocent blood; for you, Lord, have done as you pleased.”

## Jonah 1:15

So they picked up Jonah and threw him into the sea, and the sea ceased its raging.

## Jonah 1:16

Then the men greatly feared the Lord, and they offered a sacrifice to the Lord and made vows.

## Jonah 1:17

The Lord appointed a great fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was in the belly of the fish for three days and three nights.
