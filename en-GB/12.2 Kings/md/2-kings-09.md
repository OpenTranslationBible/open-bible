# 2 Kings Chapter 9

## 2 Kings 9:1

Now Elisha the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets and said to him,  
“Prepare yourself, take this flask of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead.

## 2 Kings 9:2

When you arrive there, look for Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi,  
and go in and have him rise from among his brothers, and bring him to an inner room.

## 2 Kings 9:3

Then take the flask of oil and pour it on his head, and say,  
‘This is what the Lord says: I have anointed you king over Israel.’  
Then open the door and flee, and do not delay.”

## 2 Kings 9:4

So the young man, the servant of the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead.

## 2 Kings 9:5

When he arrived, behold, the commanders of the army were sitting, and he said,  
“I have a message for you, commander.”  
And Jehu said, “For which one of us?”  
And he said, “For you, commander.”

## 2 Kings 9:6

So he got up and went into the house, and the young man poured the oil on his head and said to him,  
“This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says:  
‘I have anointed you king over the people of the Lord, over Israel.

## 2 Kings 9:7

You shall strike the house of your master Ahab,  
so that I may avenge the blood of My servants the prophets,  
and the blood of all the servants of the Lord, at the hand of Jezebel.

## 2 Kings 9:8

For the entire house of Ahab shall perish,  
and I will eliminate from Ahab every male person, both slave and free in Israel.

## 2 Kings 9:9

I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,  
and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah.

## 2 Kings 9:10

The dogs will eat Jezebel in the territory of Jezreel,  
and no one will bury her.’”  
Then he opened the door and fled.

## 2 Kings 9:11

Now Jehu went out to the servants of his master, and one said to him,  
“Is everything well? Why did this madman come to you?”  
And he said to them, “You know the man and his talk.”

## 2 Kings 9:12

But they said, “It is a lie! Tell us now.”  
And he said, “This is what he said to me:  
‘This is what the Lord says: I have anointed you king over Israel.’”

## 2 Kings 9:13

Then they hurried, and each man took his garment and put it under him on the bare steps,  
and blew the trumpet, saying, “Jehu is king!”

## 2 Kings 9:14

So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram.  
Now Joram was keeping guard at Ramoth-gilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Aram.

## 2 Kings 9:15

But King Joram had returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds  
which the Arameans had inflicted on him when he fought against Hazael king of Aram.  
So Jehu said, “If this is your decision,  
then let no one escape or leave the city to go tell it in Jezreel.”

## 2 Kings 9:16

Then Jehu rode in a chariot and went to Jezreel,  
for Joram was lying there recovering.  
And Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram.

## 2 Kings 9:17

Now the watchman was standing on the tower in Jezreel and saw the company of Jehu as he came,  
and he said, “I see a company.”  
And Joram said, “Take a horseman and send him to meet them, and have him say, ‘Is it peace?’”

## 2 Kings 9:18

So a horseman went to meet him and said, “Thus says the king, ‘Is it peace?’”  
And Jehu said, “What have you to do with peace? Turn behind me.”  
And the watchman reported, “The messenger came to them, but he did not return.”

## 2 Kings 9:19

Then he sent out a second horseman, who came to them and said,  
“Thus says the king, ‘Is it peace?’”  
And Jehu answered, “What have you to do with peace? Turn behind me.”

## 2 Kings 9:20

And the watchman reported, “He came up to them, but he did not return.  
And the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi, for he drives furiously.”

---

## 2 Kings 9:21

Then Joram said, “Get ready.” And they made his chariot ready.  
And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot,  
and they went out to meet Jehu and found him in the property of Naboth the Jezreelite.

## 2 Kings 9:22

When Joram saw Jehu, he said, “Is it peace, Jehu?”  
And he answered, “What peace,  
so long as the harlotries of your mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?”

## 2 Kings 9:23

So Joram turned the reins and fled, and said to Ahaziah, “There is treachery, Ahaziah!”

## 2 Kings 9:24

Then Jehu drew his bow with full strength and shot Joram between his arms;  
and the arrow went through his heart, and he sank in his chariot.

## 2 Kings 9:25

And Jehu said to Bidkar his officer,  
“Take him up and throw him into the field of Naboth the Jezreelite,  
for remember, when you and I were riding together behind Ahab his father,  
the Lord pronounced this sentence against him:

## 2 Kings 9:26

‘Certainly I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons,’ declares the Lord,  
‘and I will repay you in this property,’ declares the Lord.  
So now, take him and throw him into the property, in accordance with the word of the Lord.”

---

## 2 Kings 9:27

Now when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the road to Beth-haggan.  
But Jehu pursued him and said, “Strike him down, too, in the chariot.”  
So they struck him on the ascent to Gur, which is at Ibleam.  
But he fled to Megiddo and died there.

## 2 Kings 9:28

Then his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem  
and buried him in his grave with his fathers in the city of David.

## 2 Kings 9:29

Now in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab, Ahaziah became king over Judah.

## 2 Kings 9:30

Now when Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel heard about it.  
And she put makeup on her eyes and adorned her head and looked out through the window.

## 2 Kings 9:31

As Jehu entered the gate, she said,  
“Is it well, Zimri, your master’s murderer?”

## 2 Kings 9:32

Then he raised his face toward the window and said,  
“Who is on my side? Who?”  
And two or three officials looked down at him.

## 2 Kings 9:33

And he said, “Throw her down.”  
So they threw her down, and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall and on the horses,  
and he trampled her underfoot.

## 2 Kings 9:34

Then he went in and ate and drank, and he said,  
“See now to this cursed woman and bury her, for she is a king’s daughter.”

## 2 Kings 9:35

So they went to bury her,  
but they found nothing more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands.

## 2 Kings 9:36

Therefore they returned and informed him.  
And he said,  
“This is the word of the Lord, which He spoke by His servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying,  
‘In the property of Jezreel the dogs shall eat the flesh of Jezebel;

## 2 Kings 9:37

and the corpse of Jezebel will be like dung on the face of the field in the property of Jezreel,  
so they cannot say, “This is Jezebel.”’”
