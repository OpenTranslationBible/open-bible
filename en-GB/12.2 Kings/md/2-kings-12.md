# 2 Kings Chapter 12

## 2 Kings 12:1

In the seventh year of Jehu, Jehoash began his reign,  
and he ruled for forty years in Jerusalem.  
His mother was Zibiah from Beersheba.

## 2 Kings 12:2

Jehoash did what was right in the sight of the Lord all his days,  
in which Jehoiada the priest instructed him.

## 2 Kings 12:3

However, the high places were not removed;  
the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense on them.

## 2 Kings 12:4

Then Jehoash said to the priests,  
“All the money of the sacred offerings which is brought into the house of the Lord,  
in current money—both the money for each person's assessment and all the money which anyone’s heart prompts him to bring into the house of the Lord—

## 2 Kings 12:5

Let the priests take it for themselves, each from his own acquaintance;  
and let them repair the damages of the house wherever any damage is found.”

## 2 Kings 12:6

But it came about that in the twenty-third year of King Jehoash,  
the priests had not repaired the damage to the house.

## 2 Kings 12:7

Then King Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest and for the other priests, and said to them,  
“Why have you not repaired the damage to the house?  
Now, do not take any more money from your acquaintances,  
but hand it over for the repair of the house.”

## 2 Kings 12:8

So the priests agreed that they would not take any more money from the people,  
nor repair the damage to the house themselves.

## 2 Kings 12:9

But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, bored a hole in its lid,  
and placed it beside the altar, on the right side as one comes into the house of the Lord;  
and the priests who guarded the threshold put in it all the money which was brought into the house of the Lord.

## 2 Kings 12:10

When they saw that there was much money in the chest,  
the king’s scribe and the high priest came up,  
and they put the money in bags and counted the money found in the house of the Lord.

## 2 Kings 12:11

Then they gave the money, which had been counted,  
into the hands of those who did the work,  
who had the oversight of the house of the Lord;  
and they paid it out to the carpenters and builders who worked on the house of the Lord,

## 2 Kings 12:12

and to the masons and the stonecutters,  
and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the damage to the house of the Lord,  
and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it.

## 2 Kings 12:13

However, there were not made for the house of the Lord silver cups, snuffers, bowls, trumpets,  
any vessels of gold or silver, from the money that was brought into the house of the Lord;

## 2 Kings 12:14

for they allocated it to the workmen, who used it to restore the house of the Lord.

## 2 Kings 12:15

Moreover, they did not require an accounting from the men into whose hand they gave the money to pay the workmen,  
for they dealt faithfully.

## 2 Kings 12:16

The money from the guilt offerings and the money from the sin offerings  
was not brought into the house of the Lord; it was kept by the priests.

## 2 Kings 12:17

Then Hazael king of Aram advanced and fought against Gath and captured it,  
and Hazael prepared to go up to Jerusalem.

## 2 Kings 12:18

So Jehoash king of Judah took all the sacred things  
that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated,  
and his own sacred things, and all the gold that was found among the treasuries of the house of the Lord and of the king’s house,  
and sent them to Hazael king of Aram. Then he withdrew from Jerusalem.

## 2 Kings 12:19

As for the other events of Joash's reign and all he accomplished,  
are they not recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?

## 2 Kings 12:20

And his servants arose and formed a conspiracy,  
and struck Joash at the house of Millo, on the way down to Silla.

## 2 Kings 12:21

For Jozacar the son of Shimeath and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, struck him and he died.  
And they buried him with his fathers in the city of David,  
and Amaziah his son succeeded him as king.
