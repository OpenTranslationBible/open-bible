# 2 Kings Chapter 6

## 2 Kings 6:1

The sons of the prophets approached Elisha, saying,  
“See now, the place where we dwell under your guidance is too cramped for us.

## 2 Kings 6:2

Allow us to go to the Jordan, and each of us will take a beam from there,  
and let us construct a place there for ourselves where we may reside.”  
So he said, “Go.”

## 2 Kings 6:3

Then one of them said, “Please accompany your servants.”  
And he replied, “I shall go.”

## 2 Kings 6:4

So he went with them;  
and upon reaching the Jordan, they began cutting down trees.

## 2 Kings 6:5

But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water.  
And he cried out and said, “Oh, my master! It was borrowed!”

## 2 Kings 6:6

The man of God asked, “Where did it fall?”  
And when he showed him the spot,  
he cut off a stick and threw it there, causing the iron to float.

## 2 Kings 6:7

And he said, “Pick it up for yourself.”  
So he reached out his hand and took it.

## 2 Kings 6:8

The king of Aram was warring against Israel,  
and he consulted with his servants, saying,  
“At such and such a place shall be my camp.”

## 2 Kings 6:9

But the man of God sent word to the king of Israel, saying,  
“Be careful not to pass by this place, for the Arameans are coming down there.”

## 2 Kings 6:10

So the king of Israel sent someone to the place about which the man of God had told him.  
Thus he warned him, so that he guarded himself there more than once or twice.

## 2 Kings 6:11

The heart of the king of Aram was enraged over this matter;  
and he called his servants and said to them,  
“Will you not tell me which of us is for the king of Israel?”

## 2 Kings 6:12

One of his servants replied,  
“No, my lord the king; but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel,  
informs the king of Israel of the words you speak in your bedroom.”

## 2 Kings 6:13

So he said, “Go and see where he is, so that I may send men to capture him.”  
And it was reported to him, saying, “Behold, he is in Dothan.”

## 2 Kings 6:14

So he dispatched horses, chariots, and a substantial army there,  
and they arrived by night and surrounded the city.

## 2 Kings 6:15

When the attendant of the man of God rose early and went out,  
behold, an army with horses and chariots was encircling the city.  
And his servant said to him,  
“Alas, my master! What are we to do?”

## 2 Kings 6:16

So he said,  
“Do not be afraid, for those who are with us are greater than those who are with them.”

## 2 Kings 6:17

Then Elisha prayed and said,  
“Lord, kindly open his eyes, so that he may see.”  
And the Lord opened the servant’s eyes, and he saw;  
and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.

## 2 Kings 6:18

When they came down to him, Elisha prayed to the Lord and said,  
“Strike this people with blindness, I pray.”  
So He struck them with blindness in accordance with the word of Elisha.

## 2 Kings 6:19

Then Elisha said to them,  
“This is not the way, nor is this the city. Follow me, and I will lead you to the man whom you seek.”  
And he guided them to Samaria.

## 2 Kings 6:20

When they had come into Samaria, Elisha said,  
“O Lord, open the eyes of these men, so that they may see.”  
So the Lord opened their eyes, and they saw;  
and behold, they were in the middle of Samaria.

## 2 Kings 6:21

Then the king of Israel, when he saw them, said to Elisha,  
“Shall I kill them? Shall I kill them, my father?”

## 2 Kings 6:22

But he said,  
“You shall not kill them. Would you kill those you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow?  
Set bread and water before them, so that they may eat and drink and return to their master.”

## 2 Kings 6:23

So he prepared a great feast for them; and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away,  
and they returned to their master.  
And the marauding bands of Arameans did not come again into the land of Israel.

## 2 Kings 6:24

After this, Ben-hadad king of Aram gathered all his army,  
and went up and besieged Samaria.

## 2 Kings 6:25

There was a severe famine in Samaria;  
and behold, they kept besieging it until a donkey’s head was sold for eighty shekels of silver,  
and a fourth of a kab of dove’s dung for five shekels of silver.

## 2 Kings 6:26

As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried out to him, saying,  
“Help, my lord the king!”

## 2 Kings 6:27

But he said,  
“If the Lord does not help you, from where am I to help you?  
From the threshing floor, or from the winepress?”

## 2 Kings 6:28

Then the king said to her, “What is the matter with you?”  
And she answered,  
“This woman said to me, ‘Give your son so that we may eat him today,  
and we will eat my son tomorrow.’

## 2 Kings 6:29

So we cooked my son and ate him;  
and I said to her the next day, ‘Give your son, so that we may eat him’;  
but she has hidden her son.”

---

## 2 Kings 6:30

When the king heard the words of the woman, he tore his clothes—  
and as he was passing by on the wall, the people looked,  
and behold, he had sackcloth underneath on his body.

## 2 Kings 6:31

Then he said,  
“May God do so to me and more as well,  
if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat remains on him today!”

## 2 Kings 6:32

Now Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him.  
And the king sent a man ahead of him, but before the messenger came to him,  
he said to the elders,  
“Do you see how this son of a murderer has sent someone to remove my head?  
Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door and hold it shut against him.  
Is not the sound of his master’s feet behind him?”

## 2 Kings 6:33

While he was still speaking with them, behold, the messenger came down to him and said,  
“Behold, this evil is from the Lord; why should I wait for the Lord any longer?”
