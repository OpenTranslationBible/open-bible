# 2 Kings Chapter 19

## 2 Kings 19:1

Now when King Hezekiah heard this, he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth,  
and entered the house of the Lord.

## 2 Kings 19:2

Then he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebnah the scribe,  
and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth,  
to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz.

## 2 Kings 19:3

They said to him,  
“This is what Hezekiah says: ‘This day is a day of distress, rebuke, and humiliation;  
for children have come to the point of birth, and there is no strength to deliver them.

## 2 Kings 19:4

Perhaps the Lord your God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh,  
whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to taunt the living God,  
and will rebuke the words which the Lord your God has heard.  
Therefore, offer a prayer for the remnant that is left.’”

## 2 Kings 19:5

So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.

## 2 Kings 19:6

And Isaiah said to them,  
“Say this to your master: ‘This is what the Lord says:  
Do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard,  
with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me.

## 2 Kings 19:7

Behold, I am going to put a spirit in him,  
so that he will hear a rumour and return to his own land.  
And I will make him fall by the sword in his own land.’”

## 2 Kings 19:8

Then Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah,  
for he had heard that the king had left Lachish.

## 2 Kings 19:9

When he heard them say regarding Tirhakah king of Cush,  
“Behold, he has come out to fight against you,”  
he again sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,

## 2 Kings 19:10

“Say this to Hezekiah king of Judah:  
‘Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying,  
“Jerusalem will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.”

## 2 Kings 19:11

Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands, destroying them completely.  
So will you be saved?

## 2 Kings 19:12

Did the gods of the nations whom my fathers destroyed save them—  
Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the sons of Eden who were in Telassar?

## 2 Kings 19:13

Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad,  
the king of the city of Sepharvaim, and of Hena and Ivvah?’”

## 2 Kings 19:14

Then Hezekiah took the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it,  
and he went up to the house of the Lord and spread it out before the Lord.

## 2 Kings 19:15

And Hezekiah prayed before the Lord and said,  
“Lord, God of Israel, enthroned above the cherubim,  
You are the God, You alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth.  
You made the heavens and the earth.

## 2 Kings 19:16

Incline Your ear, Lord, and hear;  
open Your eyes, Lord, and see;  
and hear the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to taunt the living God.

## 2 Kings 19:17

Truly, Lord, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands,

## 2 Kings 19:18

and have thrown their gods into the fire,  
for they were not gods but only the work of human hands, wood and stone.  
So they have destroyed them.

## 2 Kings 19:19

But now Lord our God, please save us from his hand,  
so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You alone, Lord, are God.”

## 2 Kings 19:20

Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent word to Hezekiah, saying,  
“This is what the Lord, the God of Israel says:  
‘Because you have prayed to Me about Sennacherib king of Assyria, I have heard you.’

## 2 Kings 19:21

This is the word that the Lord has spoken against him:

> ‘She has despised you and mocked you,  
> The virgin daughter of Zion;  
> She has shaken her head behind you,  
> The daughter of Jerusalem!

## 2 Kings 19:22

> Whom have you taunted and blasphemed?  
> And against whom have you raised your voice,  
> And haughtily raised your eyes?  
> Against the Holy One of Israel!

## 2 Kings 19:23

> Through your messengers you have taunted the Lord, and you have said,  
> “With my many chariots I came up to the heights of the mountains,  
> To the remotest parts of Lebanon;  
> And I cut down its tall cedars and its choice junipers.  
> And I entered its farthest resting place, its thickest forest.

## 2 Kings 19:24

> I dug wells and drank foreign waters,  
> And with the soles of my feet I dried up  
> All the streams of Egypt.”’

## 2 Kings 19:25

> Have you not heard?  
> Long ago I did it,  
> From ancient times I planned it.  
> Now I have brought it about,  
> That you would turn fortified cities into ruinous heaps.

## 2 Kings 19:26

> So their inhabitants were powerless,  
> They were shattered and put to shame.  
> They were like the vegetation of the field and the green herb,  
> Like grass on the rooftops that is scorched before it has grown.

## 2 Kings 19:27

> But I know your sitting down,  
> Your going out and your coming in,  
> And your raging against Me.

## 2 Kings 19:28

> Because of your raging against Me,  
> And because your arrogance has come up to My ears,  
> I will put My hook in your nose  
> And My bridle in your lips,  
> And I will turn you back by the way that you came.

## 2 Kings 19:29

Then this shall be the sign for you:

> you will eat this year what grows of itself,  
> in the second year what springs from the same,  
> and in the third year sow, reap,  
> plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.

## 2 Kings 19:30

> And the survivors that are left of the house of Judah  
> will again take root downward and bear fruit upward.

## 2 Kings 19:31

> For out of Jerusalem a remnant will go,  
> and survivors out of Mount Zion.  
> The zeal of the Lord will perform this.

## 2 Kings 19:32

Therefore this is what the Lord says about the king of Assyria:

> ‘He will not come to this city,  
> Nor shoot an arrow there;  
> Nor come before it with a shield,  
> Nor throw up a siege ramp against it.

## 2 Kings 19:33

> By the way that he came, by the same he will return,  
> And he shall not come to this city,’ declares the Lord.

## 2 Kings 19:34

> ‘For I will protect this city to save it,  
> For My own sake, and for My servant David’s sake.’”

## 2 Kings 19:35

Then it happened that night that the angel of the Lord went out  
and struck 185,000 in the camp of the Assyrians;  
and when the people got up in the morning, behold, all of them were dead bodies.

## 2 Kings 19:36

So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and returned home,  
and lived in Nineveh.

## 2 Kings 19:37

And it came about, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god,  
that Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with the sword,  
and they escaped to the land of Ararat.  
And his son Esarhaddon became king in his place.
