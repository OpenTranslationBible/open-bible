Then the king sent messengers,  
and they gathered to him all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.

And the king went up to the house of the Lord,  
and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him,  
along with the priests, the prophets, and all the people, from the least to the greatest;  
and he read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant  
which had been found in the house of the Lord.

## 2 Kings 23:3

Then the king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the Lord,  
to walk after the Lord, and to keep His commandments, His testimonies, and His statutes with all his heart and all his soul,  
to carry out the words of this covenant that were written in this book.  
And all the people confirmed the covenant.

## 2 Kings 23:4

Then the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest,  
and the priests of the second order,  
and the doorkeepers,  
to bring out of the temple of the Lord all the utensils made for Baal,  
for Asherah, and for all the host of heaven;  
and he burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron,  
and carried their ashes to Bethel.

## 2 Kings 23:5

He also did away with the idolatrous priests  
whom the kings of Judah had appointed to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah and in the areas surrounding Jerusalem,  
also those who burned incense to Baal, to the sun, the moon, the constellations, and to all the host of heaven.

## 2 Kings 23:6

He brought out the Asherah from the house of the Lord to the outside of Jerusalem, to the brook Kidron,  
and burned it at the brook Kidron,  
and ground it to dust,  
and threw its dust on the graves of the common people.

## 2 Kings 23:7

He also tore down the houses of the male cult prostitutes which were in the house of the Lord,  
where the women were weaving hangings for the Asherah.

## 2 Kings 23:8

Then he brought all the priests from the cities of Judah,  
and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense,  
from Geba to Beersheba.  
And he tore down the high places of the gates  
which were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city,  
which were on one’s left at the city gate.

## 2 Kings 23:9

Nevertheless, the priests of the high places did not go up to the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem,  
but they ate unleavened bread among their brothers.

## 2 Kings 23:10

He also defiled Topheth, which is in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom,  
so that no one would make his son or his daughter pass through the fire for Molech.

## 2 Kings 23:11

And he removed the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun,  
at the entrance of the house of the Lord,  
by the chamber of Nathan-melech the official, which was in the annex;  
and he burned the chariots of the sun with fire.

## 2 Kings 23:12

The altars which were on the roof,  
the upper chamber of Ahaz,  
which the kings of Judah had made,  
and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courtyards of the house of the Lord,  
the king tore down;  
and he smashed them there and threw their dust into the brook Kidron.

## 2 Kings 23:13

The high places which were before Jerusalem,  
which were on the right of the mount of destruction which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians,  
for Chemosh the abomination of Moab,  
and for Milcom the abomination of the sons of Ammon,  
the king defiled.

## 2 Kings 23:14

He also smashed the memorial stones, cut down the Asherim,  
and filled their places with human bones.

---

## 2 Kings 23:15

Furthermore, the altar which was at Bethel and the high place  
which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who misled Israel into sin, had made,  
even that altar and the high place he tore down.  
Then he demolished its stones, ground them to dust, and burned the Asherah.

## 2 Kings 23:16

Now when Josiah turned,  
he saw the graves that were there on the mountain,  
and he sent men and took the bones from the graves  
and burned them on the altar, and defiled it,  
in accordance with the word of the Lord which the man of God had proclaimed,  
who had proclaimed these things.

## 2 Kings 23:17

Then he said,  
“What is this monument that I see?”  
And the men of the city told him,  
“It is the grave of the man of God who came from Judah,  
and proclaimed these things which you have done against the altar at Bethel.”

## 2 Kings 23:18

And he said,  
“Leave it alone, no one is to disturb his bones.”  
So they left his bones undisturbed,  
with the bones of the prophet who came from Samaria.

## 2 Kings 23:19

Then Josiah also removed all the shrines of the high places  
which were in the cities of Samaria,  
which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the Lord to anger;  
and he did to them just as he had done in Bethel.

## 2 Kings 23:20

And he slaughtered on the altars all the priests of the high places who were there,  
and burned human bones on them;  
then he returned to Jerusalem.

---

## 2 Kings 23:21

Then the king commanded all the people, saying,  
“Celebrate the Passover to the Lord your God  
as it is written in this Book of the Covenant.”

## 2 Kings 23:22

For such a Passover had not been celebrated  
since the days of the judges who judged Israel,  
nor in all the days of the kings of Israel and the kings of Judah.

## 2 Kings 23:23

But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah,  
this Passover was celebrated to the Lord in Jerusalem.

---

## 2 Kings 23:24

Moreover, Josiah removed the mediums, the spiritists, the household idols, the idols,  
and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem,  
so that he might confirm the words of the Law  
which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the Lord.

## 2 Kings 23:25

Before him there was no king like him  
who turned to the Lord with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his might,  
in accordance with all the Law of Moses;  
nor did any like him arise after him.

---

## 2 Kings 23:26

However, the Lord did not turn away from the greatness of His wrath  
with which His anger burned against Judah,  
because of all the provocations with which Manasseh had provoked Him.

## 2 Kings 23:27

And the Lord said,  
“I will also remove Judah from My sight,  
as I have removed Israel.  
And I will reject Jerusalem, this city which I have chosen,  
and the temple of which I said, ‘My name shall be there.’”

---

## 2 Kings 23:28

Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and all that he did,  
are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?

## 2 Kings 23:29

In his days Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt went up to the king of Assyria to the Euphrates River.  
And King Josiah went to meet him,  
but when Pharaoh Neco saw him he killed him at Megiddo.

## 2 Kings 23:30

His servants carried his body in a chariot from Megiddo,  
and brought him to Jerusalem,  
and buried him in his own tomb.  
Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz son of Josiah,  
anointed him, and made him king in place of his father.

---

## 2 Kings 23:31

Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king,  
and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.  
And his mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.

## 2 Kings 23:32

He did evil in the sight of the Lord,  
in accordance with all that his fathers had done.

## 2 Kings 23:33

And Pharaoh Neco imprisoned him at Riblah in the land of Hamath,  
so that he would not reign in Jerusalem;  
and he imposed on the land a fine of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.

## 2 Kings 23:34

Then Pharaoh Neco made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in place of his father Josiah,  
and changed his name to Jehoiakim.  
But he took Jehoahaz and brought him to Egypt, and he died there.

## 2 Kings 23:35

So Jehoiakim gave the silver and gold to Pharaoh,  
but he taxed the land to give the money at the command of Pharaoh.  
He exacted the silver and gold from the people of the land, each according to his assessment,  
to give it to Pharaoh Neco.

---

## 2 Kings 23:36

Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king,  
and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.  
And his mother’s name was Zebidah the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.

## 2 Kings 23:37

He did evil in the sight of the Lord,  
in accordance with all that his fathers had done.
