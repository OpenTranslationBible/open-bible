# 2 Kings Chapter 13

## 2 Kings 13:1

In the twenty-third year of Joash the son of Ahaziah, king of Judah,  
Jehoahaz the son of Jehu became king over Israel at Samaria, and he reigned seventeen years.

## 2 Kings 13:2

He did evil in the sight of the Lord, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,  
who made Israel sin; he did not turn away from them.

## 2 Kings 13:3

So the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel,  
and He continually handed them over to the hand of Hazael king of Aram,  
and to the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael.

## 2 Kings 13:4

Then Jehoahaz pleaded for the favour of the Lord,  
and the Lord listened to him;  
for He saw the oppression of Israel, how the king of Aram oppressed them.

## 2 Kings 13:5

And the Lord gave Israel a deliverer,  
so that they escaped from under the hand of the Arameans;  
and the sons of Israel lived in their tents as previously.

## 2 Kings 13:6

Nevertheless, they did not turn away from the sins of the house of Jeroboam,  
which he caused Israel to commit, but walked in them;  
and the Asherah also remained standing in Samaria.

## 2 Kings 13:7

For he left to Jehoahaz no more of the army than fifty horsemen, ten chariots, and ten thousand foot soldiers,  
for the king of Aram had destroyed them and made them like the dust at threshing.

## 2 Kings 13:8

Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz and all that he did and his might,  
are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

## 2 Kings 13:9

And Jehoahaz lay down with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria;  
and his son Jehoash became king in his place.

## 2 Kings 13:10

In the thirty-seventh year of Joash king of Judah,  
Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz became king over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned sixteen years.

## 2 Kings 13:11

He did evil in the sight of the Lord;  
he did not turn away from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,  
who caused Israel to sin, but walked in them.

## 2 Kings 13:12

Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash and all that he did, and his might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah,  
are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

## 2 Kings 13:13

So Jehoash lay down with his fathers, and Jeroboam sat on his throne;  
and Jehoash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.

## 2 Kings 13:14

When Elisha became sick with the illness of which he was to die,  
Jehoash the king of Israel came down to him and wept over him and said,  
“My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!”

## 2 Kings 13:15

And Elisha said to him,  
“Take a bow and arrows.”  
So he took a bow and arrows for himself.

## 2 Kings 13:16

Then he said to the king of Israel,  
“Put your hand on the bow.”  
And he put his hand on it,  
and Elisha put his hands on the king’s hands.

## 2 Kings 13:17

And he said, “Open the window toward the east,” and he opened it.  
Then Elisha said, “Shoot!” and he shot.  
And he said,  
“The Lord’s arrow of victory, and the arrow of victory over Aram;  
for you will strike the Arameans at Aphek until you have destroyed them.”

## 2 Kings 13:18

Then he said, “Take the arrows,” and he took them.  
And he said to the king of Israel,  
“Strike the ground,” and he struck it three times and stopped.

## 2 Kings 13:19

Then the man of God was angry with him and said,  
“You should have struck five or six times;  
then you would have struck Aram until you had put an end to it.  
But now you shall strike Aram only three times.”

## 2 Kings 13:20

And Elisha died, and they buried him.  
Now bands of Moabites would invade the land in the spring of the year.

## 2 Kings 13:21

And as they were burying a man, behold, they saw a marauding band;  
and they threw the man into the grave of Elisha.  
And when the man touched the bones of Elisha, he revived and stood up on his feet.

## 2 Kings 13:22

Now Hazael king of Aram had oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.

## 2 Kings 13:23

But the Lord was gracious to them and had compassion on them and turned to them,  
because of His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,  
and would not destroy them or cast them from His presence until now.

## 2 Kings 13:24

When Hazael king of Aram died, his son Ben-hadad became king in his place.

## 2 Kings 13:25

Then Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again from the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael  
the cities which he had taken in war from the hand of his father Jehoahaz.  
Jehoash defeated him three times and recovered the cities of Israel.
