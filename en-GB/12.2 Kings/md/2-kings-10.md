# 2 Kings Chapter 10

## 2 Kings 10:1

Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria.  
So Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria,  
to the rulers of Jezreel, the elders, and the guardians of the sons of Ahab, saying,

## 2 Kings 10:2

“Now when this letter comes to you, since your master’s sons are with you,  
and you have chariots, horses, a fortified city, and weapons,

## 2 Kings 10:3

select the best and most capable of your master’s sons,  
set him on his father’s throne, and fight for your master’s house.”

## 2 Kings 10:4

But they were very afraid and said,  
“Behold, the two kings could not stand before him;  
how then can we stand?”

## 2 Kings 10:5

And the overseer of the house, and the overseer of the city,  
together with the elders and the guardians, sent word to Jehu, saying,  
“We are your servants; all that you say we will do.  
We will not make anyone king. Do what is good in your eyes.”

## 2 Kings 10:6

Then he wrote a letter to them a second time, saying,  
“If you are on my side, and will listen to my voice,  
take the heads of the men, your master’s sons,  
and come to me at Jezreel tomorrow at this time.”  
Now the king’s sons, seventy persons, were with the leaders of the city, who were raising them.

## 2 Kings 10:7

And when the letter came to them, they took the king’s sons and slaughtered them, seventy persons,  
and put their heads in baskets and sent them to him at Jezreel.

## 2 Kings 10:8

When the messenger came and told him, saying,  
“They have brought the heads of the king’s sons,”  
he said,  
“Put them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until morning.”

## 2 Kings 10:9

In the morning he went out and stood, and said to all the people,  
“You are righteous; behold, I conspired against my master and killed him.  
But who killed all these?

## 2 Kings 10:10

Know then that nothing shall fall to the ground of the word of the Lord,  
which the Lord spoke concerning the house of Ahab,  
for the Lord has done what He spoke through His servant Elijah.”

## 2 Kings 10:11

So Jehu struck down all who remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel,  
and all his great men, his acquaintances, and his priests,  
until he left him without a survivor.

## 2 Kings 10:12

Then he arose and departed, and went to Samaria.  
On the way, while he was at Beth-eked of the shepherds,

## 2 Kings 10:13

Jehu met the relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah and said,  
“Who are you?”  
And they answered,  
“We are the relatives of Ahaziah,  
and we have come down to greet the sons of the king and the sons of the queen mother.”

## 2 Kings 10:14

Then he said, “Take them alive.”  
So they took them alive and killed them at the well of Beth-eked, forty-two men,  
and he left none of them alive.

## 2 Kings 10:15

Now when he had departed from there, he met Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him;  
and he greeted him and said to him,  
“Is your heart right, as my heart is with your heart?”  
And Jehonadab answered, “It is.”  
Jehu said, “If it is, give me your hand.”  
And he gave him his hand, and he took him up to him into the chariot.

## 2 Kings 10:16

And he said,  
“Come with me and see my zeal for the Lord.”  
So he had him ride in his chariot.

## 2 Kings 10:17

When he came to Samaria, he struck down all who remained to Ahab in Samaria,  
until he had eliminated them, according to the word of the Lord which He spoke to Elijah.

## 2 Kings 10:18

Then Jehu gathered all the people and said to them,  
“Ahab served Baal a little; Jehu will serve him much.

## 2 Kings 10:19

Now, summon to me all the prophets of Baal, all his worshippers and all his priests;  
let no one be missing, for I have a great sacrifice for Baal; whoever is missing shall not live.”  
But Jehu was acting deceitfully, in order to eliminate the worshippers of Baal.

## 2 Kings 10:20

And Jehu said, “Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal.”  
So they proclaimed it.

## 2 Kings 10:21

Then Jehu sent word throughout Israel, and all the worshippers of Baal came,  
so that there was no one left who did not come.  
When they entered the house of Baal, the house of Baal was filled from one end to the other.

## 2 Kings 10:22

And he said to the one who was in charge of the wardrobe,  
“Bring out garments for all the worshippers of Baal.”  
So he brought out garments for them.

## 2 Kings 10:23

Then Jehu and Jehonadab the son of Rechab entered the house of Baal,  
and he said to the worshippers of Baal,  
“Search carefully and see that there is not here with you any of the servants of the Lord, but only the worshippers of Baal.”

## 2 Kings 10:24

Then they entered to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings.  
Now Jehu had stationed for himself eighty men outside,  
and he said,  
“The one who lets any of the men escape whom I bring into your hands shall give up his life in exchange.”

## 2 Kings 10:25

Then it came about, as soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering,  
that Jehu said to the guards and to the officers,  
“Go in, kill them; let no one come out.”  
So they struck them with the edge of the sword,  
and the guards and the officers threw them out, and went into the inner room of the house of Baal.

## 2 Kings 10:26

And they brought out the memorial stones of the house of Baal and burned them.

## 2 Kings 10:27

They also tore down the memorial stone of Baal and tore down the house of Baal,  
and made it a latrine to this day.

## 2 Kings 10:28

Thus Jehu eradicated Baal from Israel.

## 2 Kings 10:29

However, Jehu did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,  
who caused Israel to sin—specifically, the golden calves that were in Bethel and Dan.

## 2 Kings 10:30

And the Lord said to Jehu,  
“Because you have done well in carrying out what is right in My eyes,  
and have done to the house of Ahab in accordance with all that was in My heart,  
your sons to the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.”

## 2 Kings 10:31

But Jehu was not careful to walk in the Law of the Lord, the God of Israel, with all his heart;  
he did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, which he caused Israel to commit.

---

## 2 Kings 10:32

In those days the Lord began to cut off pieces from Israel;  
and Hazael defeated them throughout the territory of Israel:

## 2 Kings 10:33

from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead—  
the Gadites, the Reubenites, and the Manassites—  
from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.

## 2 Kings 10:34

Now the rest of the acts of Jehu and all that he did, and all his might,  
are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

## 2 Kings 10:35

And Jehu slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria;  
and Jehoahaz his son became king in his place.

## 2 Kings 10:36

Jehu's reign over Israel in Samaria lasted for twenty-eight years.
