# 2 Kings Chapter 4

## 2 Kings 4:1

Now a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha, saying,  
“Your servant, my husband, is dead, and you know that your servant feared the Lord.  
Now the creditor has come to take my two children to be his slaves.”

## 2 Kings 4:2

Elisha responded to her,  
“How can I assist you? Please tell me, what do you have in your house?”  
And she replied,  
“Your maidservant has nothing in the house except a jar of oil.”

## 2 Kings 4:3

Then he said,  
“Go, borrow containers elsewhere for yourself, from all your neighbours — empty vessels; do not get just a few.

## 2 Kings 4:4

Then go in and shut the door behind you and your sons, and pour the oil into all these containers;  
and you shall set aside each one when it is full.”

## 2 Kings 4:5

So she left him and shut the door behind her and her sons.  
They kept bringing the containers to her, and she kept pouring.

## 2 Kings 4:6

When the containers were full, she said to her son, “Bring me another container.”  
But he said to her, “There is not one more.”  
Then the oil stopped.

## 2 Kings 4:7

So she came and informed the man of God.  
And he instructed her,  
“Go, sell the oil and settle your debt, and you and your sons can live on the remainder.”

## 2 Kings 4:8

Now there came a day when Elisha went over to Shunem,  
where there was a prominent woman, and she urged him to eat food.  
So whenever he passed by, he would turn in there to eat.

## 2 Kings 4:9

And she said to her husband,  
“Behold now, I know that this is a holy man of God who passes by us continually.

## 2 Kings 4:10

Please, let us make a little walled upper room,  
and put a bed for him there, and a table, a chair, and a lampstand;  
and it shall be, when he comes to us, that he can turn in there.”

## 2 Kings 4:11

One day he came there and turned in to the upper room and lay down there.

## 2 Kings 4:12

And he said to Gehazi his servant,  
“Call this Shunammite woman.”  
So he called her, and she stood before him.

## 2 Kings 4:13

And he said to him, “Say now to her,  
‘Behold, you have taken all this trouble for us; what can I do for you?  
Should I speak for you to the king or to the commander of the army?’”  
But she answered, “I am living among my own people.”

## 2 Kings 4:14

So he said, “What then is to be done for her?”  
And Gehazi answered, “Well, she has no son, and her husband is old.”

## 2 Kings 4:15

Then he said, “Call her.”  
So he called her, and she stood in the doorway.

## 2 Kings 4:16

Then he said,  
“At this time next year, you are going to embrace a son.”  
But she said, “No, my lord, you man of God, do not lie to your servant.”

## 2 Kings 4:17

But the woman conceived and gave birth to a son at that season the next year,  
just as Elisha had told her.

## 2 Kings 4:18

Now the child grew.  
And it happened one day that he went out to his father, to the reapers.

## 2 Kings 4:19

And he said to his father, “My head, my head!”  
And he said to his servant, “Carry him to his mother.”

## 2 Kings 4:20

When he had carried him and brought him to his mother, he sat on her lap until noon,  
and then he passed away.

## 2 Kings 4:21

So she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God,  
and shut the door behind him and left.

## 2 Kings 4:22

She called to her husband and said,  
“Please send me one of the servants and one of the donkeys,  
so that I may run to the man of God and return.”

## 2 Kings 4:23

But he said,  
“Why are you going to him today? It is neither the new moon nor the Sabbath.”  
And she said, “It will be well.”

## 2 Kings 4:24

Then she saddled the donkey and said to her servant,  
“Drive on and do not slow down the pace for me unless I tell you.”

## 2 Kings 4:25

So she went and came to the man of God at Mount Carmel.  
When the man of God saw her at a distance, he said to Gehazi his servant,  
“Behold, there is the Shunammite woman.

## 2 Kings 4:26

Now please run to meet her and say to her,  
‘Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child?’”  
And she answered, “It is well.”

## 2 Kings 4:27

When she came to the man of God at the hill, she took hold of his feet.  
And Gehazi came up to push her away, but the man of God said,  
“Leave her alone, for her soul is troubled within her;  
and the Lord has hidden it from me and has not informed me.”

## 2 Kings 4:28

Then she said,  
“Did I ask for a son from my lord? Did I not say, ‘Do not mislead me’?”

## 2 Kings 4:29

Then he said to Gehazi,  
“Get ready, take my staff in your hand and go.  
If you meet anyone, do not greet him,  
and if anyone greets you, do not answer him.  
And lay my staff on the boy’s face.”

## 2 Kings 4:30

But the mother of the boy said,  
“As surely as the Lord lives and as you yourself live,  
I will not leave you.”  
So he got up and followed her.

## 2 Kings 4:31

Now Gehazi went on ahead of them and laid the staff on the boy’s face,  
but there was no sound or response.  
So he returned to meet him and told him, “The boy has not awakened.”

## 2 Kings 4:32

When Elisha came into the house,  
behold, the boy was dead and laid on his bed.

## 2 Kings 4:33

So he entered and shut the door behind the two of them, and prayed to the Lord.

## 2 Kings 4:34

Then he got up on the bed and lay on the child,  
putting his mouth on his mouth, his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands,  
and as he bent down on him, the flesh of the child became warm.

## 2 Kings 4:35

Then he returned and walked in the house once back and forth,  
and went up and bent down on him again;  
and the boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes.

## 2 Kings 4:36

And he called Gehazi and said, “Call this Shunammite.”  
So he called her, and when she came in to him, he said, “Pick up your son.”

## 2 Kings 4:37

Then she came in and fell at his feet and bowed to the ground.  
And she picked up her son and went out.

## 2 Kings 4:38

When Elisha returned to Gilgal, there was a famine in the land.  
As the sons of the prophets were sitting before him, he instructed his servant,  
“Put on the large pot and prepare stew for the sons of the prophets.”

## 2 Kings 4:39

Then one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine,  
and gathered from it a lapful of wild gourds, and came and sliced them into the pot of stew,  
though they did not know what they were.

## 2 Kings 4:40

So they served it to the men to eat.  
But as they were eating the stew, they cried out and said,  
“Man of God, there is death in the pot!”  
And they were unable to eat it.

## 2 Kings 4:41

Then he said, “Bring flour.”  
And he threw it into the pot and said,  
“Serve it to the people and let them eat.”  
And there was nothing harmful in the pot.

## 2 Kings 4:42

Now a man came from Baal-shalishah,  
and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits: twenty loaves of barley bread  
and fresh ears of grain in his sack.  
And Elisha said, “Give them to the people so that they may eat.”

## 2 Kings 4:43

But his attendant said,  
“How am I to set this before a hundred men?”  
Yet he said, “Give them to the people so that they may eat,  
for this is what the Lord says:  
‘They shall eat and have some left over.’”

## 2 Kings 4:44

So he set it before them, and they ate and had some remaining,  
according to the word of the Lord.
