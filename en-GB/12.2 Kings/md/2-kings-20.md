# 2 Kings Chapter 20

## 2 Kings 20:1

In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill.  
And Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, came to him and said to him,  
“This is what the Lord says: ‘Set your house in order, for you are going to die and not live.’”

## 2 Kings 20:2

At this, he turned towards the wall and prayed to the Lord, saying,

## 2 Kings 20:3

“Please, Lord, just remember how I have walked before You wholeheartedly and truthfully,  
and have done what is good in Your sight.”  
And Hezekiah wept bitterly.

## 2 Kings 20:4

Now even before Isaiah had gone out of the middle courtyard,  
the word of the Lord came to him, saying,

## 2 Kings 20:5

“Return and say to Hezekiah the leader of My people,  
‘This is what the Lord, the God of your father David, says:

> I have heard your prayer,  
> I have seen your tears;  
> behold, I am going to heal you.  
> On the third day you shall go up to the house of the Lord.

## 2 Kings 20:6

> And I will add fifteen years to your life,  
> and I will save you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria,  
> and I will protect this city for My own sake,  
> and for My servant David’s sake.’”

## 2 Kings 20:7

Then Isaiah said, “Take a cake of figs.”  
And they took it and laid it on the boil, and he recovered.

## 2 Kings 20:8

Now Hezekiah said to Isaiah,  
“What will be the sign that the Lord will heal me,  
and that I will go up to the house of the Lord on the third day?”

## 2 Kings 20:9

Isaiah said,  
“This shall be the sign to you from the Lord, that the Lord will do the thing that He has spoken:

> Shall the shadow go forward ten steps,  
> or shall it go back ten steps?”

## 2 Kings 20:10

So Hezekiah answered,  
“It is easy for the shadow to decline ten steps;  
no, but have it go back ten steps.”

## 2 Kings 20:11

Then Isaiah the prophet called out to the Lord,  
and He brought the shadow on the stairway back ten steps,  
by which it had gone down on the stairway of Ahaz.

## 2 Kings 20:12

At that time Berodach-baladan, a son of Baladan, king of Babylon,  
sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah, for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.

## 2 Kings 20:13

And Hezekiah listened to them, and showed them all his treasure house—  
the silver, the gold, the balsam oil, the scented oil, his armour, and everything that was found in his treasuries.  
There was nothing in his house, nor in all his realm, that Hezekiah did not show them.

## 2 Kings 20:14

Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and said to him,  
“What did these men say, and from where did they come to you?”  
And Hezekiah said, “They came from a far country, from Babylon.”

## 2 Kings 20:15

And he said, “What have they seen in your house?”  
So Hezekiah answered, “They have seen everything that is in my house;  
there is nothing among my treasuries that I have not shown them.”

## 2 Kings 20:16

Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah,  
“Hear the word of the Lord:

## 2 Kings 20:17

> ‘Behold, the days are coming when everything that is in your house,  
> and everything that your fathers have stored up to this day,  
> will be carried to Babylon; nothing will be left,’ says the Lord.

## 2 Kings 20:18

> ‘And some of your sons who will come from you,  
> whom you will father,  
> will be taken away,  
> and they will become officials in the palace of the king of Babylon.’”

## 2 Kings 20:19

Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah,  
“The word of the Lord which you have spoken is good.”  
For he thought, “Is it not good if there will be peace and truth in my days?”

## 2 Kings 20:20

Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and all his might,  
and how he made the pool and the conduit and brought water into the city,  
are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?

## 2 Kings 20:21

So Hezekiah lay down with his fathers,  
and his son Manasseh became king in his place.
