# 2 Kings Chapter 20

## 2 Kings 20:1

During that time, Hezekiah fell gravely ill.  
And Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, visited him and said,  
“This is what the Lord declares: ‘Prepare your affairs, for you will not recover; you shall die and pass away.’”

## 2 Kings 20:2

At this, he turned towards the wall and prayed to the Lord, saying,

## 2 Kings 20:3

“Please, Lord, just remember how I have walked before You wholeheartedly and truthfully,  
and have done what is good in Your sight.”  
And Hezekiah wept bitterly.

## 2 Kings 20:4

Now even before Isaiah had gone out of the middle courtyard,  
the word of the Lord came to him, saying,

## 2 Kings 20:5

“Return and tell Hezekiah, the leader of My people,  
‘This is what the Lord, the God of your ancestor David, declares:

> I have heard your prayer,  
> I have seen your tears;  
> behold, I will heal you.  
> On the third day you shall go up to the house of the Lord.

## 2 Kings 20:6

> And I will extend your life by fifteen years,  
> and I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria,  
> and I will protect this city for My own sake,  
> and for the sake of My servant David.’”

## 2 Kings 20:7

Then Isaiah said, “Take a cake of figs.”  
And they took it and laid it on the boil, and he recovered.

## 2 Kings 20:8

Hezekiah then asked Isaiah,  
“What will be the sign that the Lord will heal me,  
and that I will go up to the house of the Lord on the third day?”

## 2 Kings 20:9

Isaiah said,  
“This shall be the sign to you from the Lord, that the Lord will perform what He has promised:

> Shall the shadow advance ten steps,  
> or shall it go back ten steps?”

## 2 Kings 20:10

So Hezekiah answered,  
“It is easy for the shadow to decline ten steps;  
no, but have it go back ten steps.”

## 2 Kings 20:11

Then Isaiah the prophet called upon the Lord,  
and He caused the shadow on the stairway to move back ten steps,  
by which it had descended on the stairway of Ahaz.

## 2 Kings 20:12

Around that time, Berodach-baladan, a son of Baladan, king of Babylon,  
sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah, for he had heard of Hezekiah's illness.

## 2 Kings 20:13

And Hezekiah listened to them, and showed them all his treasure house—  
the silver, the gold, the balsam oil, the scented oil, his armour, and everything that was found in his treasuries.  
There was nothing in his house, nor in all his realm, that Hezekiah did not show them.

## 2 Kings 20:14

Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and said to him,  
“What did these men say, and from where did they come to you?”  
And Hezekiah said, “They came from a distant land, from Babylon.”

## 2 Kings 20:15

And he said, “What have they seen in your house?”  
So Hezekiah answered, “They have seen everything that is in my house;  
there is nothing among my treasuries that I have not shown them.”

## 2 Kings 20:16

Isaiah then addressed Hezekiah,  
“Hear the word of the Lord:

## 2 Kings 20:17

> ‘Behold, the days are coming when everything that is in your house,  
> and everything that your fathers have stored up to this day,  
> will be carried to Babylon; nothing will be left,’ says the Lord.

## 2 Kings 20:18

> ‘And some of your descendants, your own offspring,  
> will be taken away,  
> and they will serve as officials in the palace of the king of Babylon.’”

## 2 Kings 20:19

Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah,  
“The word of the Lord which you have spoken is good.”  
For he thought, “Is it not good if there will be peace and truth in my days?”

## 2 Kings 20:20

Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and all his achievements,  
including how he made the pool and the conduit and brought water into the city,  
are they not recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?

## 2 Kings 20:21

So Hezekiah rested with his ancestors,  
and his son Manasseh succeeded him as king.
