# 2 Kings Chapter 17

## 2 Kings 17:1

In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah,  
Hoshea son of Elah became king over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned nine years.

## 2 Kings 17:2

He did evil in the sight of the Lord,  
though not as the kings of Israel who were before him.

## 2 Kings 17:3

Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against him,  
and Hoshea became his servant and paid him tribute.

## 2 Kings 17:4

But the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea,  
for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt and had not paid tribute to the king of Assyria,  
as he had done year by year.  
So the king of Assyria shut him up and bound him in prison.

## 2 Kings 17:5

Then the king of Assyria invaded the whole land and went up to Samaria and besieged it for three years.

## 2 Kings 17:6

In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria  
and took the people of Israel into exile to Assyria,  
and settled them in Halah and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.

## 2 Kings 17:7

Now this happened because the sons of Israel had sinned against the Lord their God,  
who had brought them up from the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt,  
and they had feared other gods

## 2 Kings 17:8

and walked in the customs of the nations  
whom the Lord had driven out before the sons of Israel,  
and in the customs of the kings of Israel which they had introduced.

## 2 Kings 17:9

And the sons of Israel did things secretly which were not right against the Lord their God.  
Moreover, they built for themselves high places in all their towns,  
from watchtower to fortified city.

## 2 Kings 17:10

They set up for themselves memorial stones and Asherim on every high hill  
and under every green tree,

## 2 Kings 17:11

and there they burned incense on all the high places,  
as the nations did whom the Lord had carried away before them;  
and they did evil things, provoking the Lord.

## 2 Kings 17:12

They served idols, concerning which the Lord had said to them,  
“You shall not do this thing.”

## 2 Kings 17:13

Yet the Lord warned Israel and Judah through all His prophets and every seer, saying,  
“Turn from your evil ways and keep My commandments, My statutes  
according to all the Law which I commanded your fathers,  
and which I sent to you through My servants the prophets.”

## 2 Kings 17:14

However, they did not listen, but stiffened their necks  
like their fathers, who did not believe in the Lord their God.

## 2 Kings 17:15

They rejected His statutes and His covenant which He made with their fathers,  
and His warnings with which He warned them.  
And they followed idols and became empty,  
and followed the nations which surrounded them,  
concerning whom the Lord had commanded them not to do as they did.

## 2 Kings 17:16

They abandoned all the commandments of the Lord their God  
and made for themselves cast metal images—two calves—  
and made an Asherah, and worshipped all the heavenly lights and served Baal.

## 2 Kings 17:17

Then they made their sons and their daughters pass through the fire,  
practised divination and interpreted omens,  
and gave themselves over to do evil in the sight of the Lord, provoking Him.

## 2 Kings 17:18

So the Lord was very angry with Israel and removed them from His sight;  
none was left except the tribe of Judah alone.

## 2 Kings 17:19

Also Judah did not keep the commandments of the Lord their God,  
but they walked in the customs which Israel had introduced.

## 2 Kings 17:20

So the Lord rejected all the descendants of Israel and afflicted them,  
and handed them over to plunderers, until He had cast them from His sight.

## 2 Kings 17:21

When He had torn Israel from the house of David,  
they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king.  
Then Jeroboam drove Israel away from following the Lord  
and made them commit a great sin.

## 2 Kings 17:22

And the sons of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he committed;  
they did not depart from them,

## 2 Kings 17:23

until the Lord removed Israel from His sight,  
as He had spoken through all His servants the prophets.  
So Israel was exiled from their own land to Assyria to this day.

## 2 Kings 17:24

Then the king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim,  
and settled them in the cities of Samaria in place of the sons of Israel.  
So they possessed Samaria and lived in its cities.

## 2 Kings 17:25

And at the beginning of their living there, they did not fear the Lord;  
therefore the Lord sent lions among them that killed some of them.

## 2 Kings 17:26

So they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying,  
“The nations whom you have taken into exile and settled in the cities of Samaria  
do not know the custom of the god of the land;  
so He has sent lions among them, and behold, they are killing them,  
because they do not know the custom of the god of the land.”

## 2 Kings 17:27

Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying,  
“Take one of the priests whom you took into exile from there,  
and have him go and live there,  
and let him teach them the custom of the god of the land.”

## 2 Kings 17:28

So one of the priests who had been taken into exile from Samaria came  
and lived in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the Lord.

## 2 Kings 17:29

But every nation still made gods of its own  
and put them in the houses of the high places  
which the people of Samaria had made,  
every nation in their cities where they lived.

## 2 Kings 17:30

The men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth,  
the men of Cuth made Nergal,  
the men of Hamath made Ashima,

## 2 Kings 17:31

and the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak,  
and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire  
to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.

## 2 Kings 17:32

They also feared the Lord,  
and appointed from among themselves priests of the high places,  
who acted for them in the houses of the high places.

## 2 Kings 17:33

They feared the Lord, yet served their own gods  
in accordance with the customs of the nations  
from among whom they had been taken into exile.

## 2 Kings 17:34

To this day they act in accordance with the earlier customs:  
they do not fear the Lord, nor do they follow His statutes, His ordinances, the Law,  
or the commandment which the Lord commanded the sons of Jacob,  
whom He named Israel;

## 2 Kings 17:35

with whom the Lord made a covenant and commanded them, saying,  
“You shall not fear other gods, nor bow down to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them.

## 2 Kings 17:36

But the Lord, who brought you up from the land of Egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm,  
Him you shall fear, and to Him you shall bow down, and to Him you shall sacrifice.

## 2 Kings 17:37

And the statutes, the ordinances, the Law, and the commandment which He wrote for you,  
you shall be careful to do always,  
and you shall not fear other gods.

## 2 Kings 17:38

And the covenant that I have made with you,  
you shall not forget,  
nor shall you fear other gods.

## 2 Kings 17:39

But the Lord your God you shall fear;  
and He will save you from the hand of all your enemies.”

## 2 Kings 17:40

However, they did not listen, but kept acting in accordance with their earlier custom.

## 2 Kings 17:41

So while these nations feared the Lord,  
they also served their idols;  
their children likewise and their grandchildren,  
just as their fathers acted, so they do to this day.
