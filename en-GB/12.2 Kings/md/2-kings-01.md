‘Go back to the king who sent you and say to him,  
This is what the Lord says: Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending men to consult Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?  
Therefore you shall not leave the bed you are lying on. You will surely die.’”

“Man of God, the king says, ‘Come down!’”

Elijah answered the captain,  
“If I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men.”  
Then fire fell from heaven and consumed the captain and his men.

This third captain went up, fell on his knees before Elijah, and begged him,  
“Man of God, please have regard for my life and the lives of these fifty servants of yours.

## 2 Kings 1:14

See, fire has come down from heaven and consumed the first two captains and their men.  
But now, please let my life be precious in your sight.”

He said to the king,  
“This is what the Lord says:  
You have sent messengers to consult Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron.  
Is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of His word?  
Therefore you shall not leave the bed you are lying on. You will surely die.”

## 2 Kings 1:17
