# 2 Kings Chapter 22

## 2 Kings 22:1

Josiah was eight years old when he became king,  
and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem.  
And his mother’s name was Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath.

## 2 Kings 22:2

He did what was right in the sight of the Lord,  
and walked in all the way of his father David,  
and did not turn aside to the right or to the left.

## 2 Kings 22:3

Now in the eighteenth year of King Josiah,  
the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam the scribe,  
to the house of the Lord, saying,

## 2 Kings 22:4

“Go up to Hilkiah the high priest,  
so that he may count the money brought into the house of the Lord,  
which the doorkeepers have collected from the people.

## 2 Kings 22:5

And have them hand it over to the workmen who have oversight of the house of the Lord,  
and have them give it to the workmen who are in the house of the Lord  
to repair the damage to the house,

## 2 Kings 22:6

to the craftsmen and the builders and the masons,  
and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the house.

## 2 Kings 22:7

However, no accounting shall be made with them for the money handed over to them,  
because they deal faithfully.”

## 2 Kings 22:8

Then Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe,  
“I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the Lord.”  
And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, who read it.

## 2 Kings 22:9

And Shaphan the scribe came to the king and brought back word to the king, and said,  
“Your servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house,  
and have handed it over to the workmen who have oversight of the house of the Lord.”

## 2 Kings 22:10

Moreover, Shaphan the scribe informed the king, saying,  
“Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.”  
And Shaphan read it before the king.

## 2 Kings 22:11

Now when the king heard the words of the Book of the Law,  
he tore his clothes.

## 2 Kings 22:12

Then the king commanded Hilkiah the priest,  
Ahikam son of Shaphan, Achbor son of Micaiah, Shaphan the scribe,  
and Asaiah the king’s servant, saying,

## 2 Kings 22:13

“Go, inquire of the Lord for me, and the people, and all Judah  
concerning the words of this book that has been found—  
for great is the wrath of the Lord that burns against us,  
because our fathers did not listen to the words of this book,  
to do in accordance with everything written concerning us.”

## 2 Kings 22:14

So Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah  
went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe  
(now she lived in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter),  
and they spoke to her.

## 2 Kings 22:15

And she said to them,  
“This is what the Lord, the God of Israel says:  
‘Say to the man who sent you to Me,

## 2 Kings 22:16

> “This is what the Lord says:  
> Behold, I am bringing evil on this place and on its inhabitants,  
> all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read.

## 2 Kings 22:17

> Because they have abandoned Me and have burned incense to other gods,  
> so as to provoke Me to anger with all the work of their hands,  
> therefore My wrath burns against this place, and it shall not be quenched.”’

## 2 Kings 22:18

But to the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of the Lord, this is what you shall say to him:

> “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel says:  
> Regarding the words which you have heard—

## 2 Kings 22:19

> because your heart was tender and you humbled yourself before the Lord  
> when you heard what I spoke against this place and against its inhabitants,  
> that they would become an object of horror and a curse,  
> and you have torn your clothes and wept before Me,  
> I indeed have heard you,” declares the Lord.

## 2 Kings 22:20

> “Therefore, behold, I will gather you to your fathers,  
> and you will be gathered to your grave in peace,  
> and your eyes will not see all the evil which I am bringing on this place.”’”  
> So they brought back word to the king.
