# 2 Kings Chapter 2

## 2 Kings 2:1

As the time approached for the Lord to take Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha were travelling from Gilgal.

## 2 Kings 2:2

Elijah said to Elisha, “Stay here, for the Lord has sent me to Bethel.”  
But Elisha said, “As surely as the Lord lives and as you live, I will not leave you.”  
So they went down to Bethel.

## 2 Kings 2:3

The company of prophets at Bethel came out to Elisha and asked,  
“Do you know that the Lord is going to take your master from you today?”  
He replied, “Yes, I know — be silent.”

## 2 Kings 2:4

Then Elijah said to him, “Elisha, stay here, for the Lord has sent me to Jericho.”  
But he replied, “As surely as the Lord lives and as you live, I will not leave you.”  
So they went to Jericho.

## 2 Kings 2:5

The company of prophets at Jericho approached Elisha and said,  
“Do you know that today the Lord is going to take your master from you?”  
And he replied, “Yes, I know. Be silent.”

## 2 Kings 2:6

Then Elijah said to him, “Stay here, for the Lord has sent me to the Jordan.”  
But Elisha replied, “As surely as the Lord lives and as you live, I will not leave you.”  
So the two of them walked on.

## 2 Kings 2:7

Fifty men from the company of the prophets went and stood at a distance, observing the place where Elijah and Elisha had paused at the Jordan.

## 2 Kings 2:8

Then Elijah took his cloak, rolled it up, and struck the water with it.  
The water parted to the left and to the right, and the two of them crossed over on dry ground.

## 2 Kings 2:9

When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha,  
“Ask what I can do for you before I am taken from you.”  
Elisha said, “Let me inherit a double portion of your spirit.”

## 2 Kings 2:10

Elijah answered,  
“You have asked a difficult thing.  
Yet if you see me when I am taken from you, it will be yours — otherwise, it will not.”

## 2 Kings 2:11

As they were walking along and talking, suddenly a chariot of fire and horses of fire appeared and separated the two of them,  
and Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind.

## 2 Kings 2:12

Elisha saw it and cried out,  
“My father, my father! The chariot of Israel and its horsemen!”  
And Elisha saw him no more.  
Then he took hold of his own garments and tore them in two.

## 2 Kings 2:13

Elisha picked up Elijah’s cloak that had fallen from him and went back and stood at the bank of the Jordan.

## 2 Kings 2:14

He took the cloak that had fallen from Elijah, struck the water with it, and said,  
“Where is the Lord, the God of Elijah?”  
When he struck the water, it divided to the left and to the right, and Elisha crossed over.

## 2 Kings 2:15

When the company of prophets from Jericho, who were watching, saw him, they said,  
“The spirit of Elijah now rests on Elisha.”  
And they came to meet him and bowed to the ground before him.

## 2 Kings 2:16

They said to him,  
“Look, we your servants have fifty strong men. Let them go and search for your master.  
Perhaps the Spirit of the Lord has lifted him up and set him down on a mountain or in a valley.”  
But Elisha replied, “Do not send them.”

## 2 Kings 2:17

But they persisted until he was embarrassed to refuse.  
So he said, “Send them.”  
And they sent fifty men, who searched for three days but did not find him.

## 2 Kings 2:18

When they returned to Elisha, who had stayed in Jericho, he said to them,  
“Did I not tell you not to go?”

## 2 Kings 2:19

The men of the city said to Elisha,  
“Look, our lord can see that this town is well situated, but the water is bad and the land unproductive.”

## 2 Kings 2:20

Elisha instructed, “Fetch me a new bowl and place salt in it.”  
So they brought it to him.

## 2 Kings 2:21

Then he went out to the spring and threw the salt into it, saying,  
“This is what the Lord says: I have healed this water.  
Never again will it cause death or make the land barren.”

## 2 Kings 2:22

And the water has remained pure to this day, just as Elisha had declared.

## 2 Kings 2:23

From there Elisha went up to Bethel.  
As he was walking along the road, some boys came out of the city and mocked him, saying,  
“Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!”

## 2 Kings 2:24

He turned around, looked at them, and cursed them in the name of the Lord.  
Then two bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of the boys.

## 2 Kings 2:25

From there Elisha went to Mount Carmel, and then returned to Samaria.
