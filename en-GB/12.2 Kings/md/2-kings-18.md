# 2 Kings Chapter 18

## 2 Kings 18:1

Now it came about in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah, king of Israel,  
that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz, king of Judah, became king.

## 2 Kings 18:2

He was twenty-five years old when he began his reign,  
and he ruled for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem.  
His mother was Abi, the daughter of Zechariah.

## 2 Kings 18:3

He did what was right in the sight of the Lord,  
in accordance with all that his father David had done.

## 2 Kings 18:4

He removed the high places, smashed the memorial stones, cut down the Asherah,  
and also crushed to pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made,  
for until those days the sons of Israel burned incense to it;  
and it was called Nehushtan.

## 2 Kings 18:5

He placed his trust in the Lord, the God of Israel;  
there was no one like him among all the kings of Judah,  
either before or after him.

## 2 Kings 18:6

For he held fast to the Lord;  
he did not turn away from following Him,  
but kept His commandments, which the Lord had given to Moses.

## 2 Kings 18:7

And the Lord was with him; wherever he went, he found success.  
He also stood against the king of Assyria and did not serve him.

## 2 Kings 18:8

He overcame the Philistines as far as Gaza and its territory,  
from watchtower to fortified city.

## 2 Kings 18:9

In the fourth year of King Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel,  
Shalmaneser king of Assyria advanced against Samaria and laid siege to it.

## 2 Kings 18:10

At the end of three years they captured it;  
in the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel,  
Samaria was taken.

## 2 Kings 18:11

Then the king of Assyria led Israel into exile to Assyria,  
and settled them in Halah and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes,

## 2 Kings 18:12

because they did not obey the voice of the Lord their God,  
but violated His covenant—all that Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded;  
they neither listened nor obeyed.

---

## 2 Kings 18:13

In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah,  
Sennacherib king of Assyria advanced against all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them.

## 2 Kings 18:14

Then Hezekiah king of Judah sent word to the king of Assyria at Lachish, saying,  
“I have done wrong; withdraw from me.  
Whatever you impose on me, I will bear.”  
So the king of Assyria imposed on Hezekiah king of Judah a payment of three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.

## 2 Kings 18:15

Hezekiah provided him with all the silver that was found in the house of the Lord,  
and in the treasuries of the king’s house.

## 2 Kings 18:16

At that time Hezekiah removed the gold from the doors of the temple of the Lord,  
and from the doorposts which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid,  
and gave it to the king of Assyria.

## 2 Kings 18:17

Then the king of Assyria sent Tartan, Rab-saris, and Rabshakeh from Lachish  
to King Hezekiah with a large army to Jerusalem.  
So they came up and arrived at Jerusalem.  
And they went up and came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool,  
which is on the highway of the fuller’s field.

## 2 Kings 18:18

Then they called to the king,  
and Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was over the household,  
and Shebnah the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph, the recorder, came out to them.

## 2 Kings 18:19

Then Rabshakeh said to them,  
“Say now to Hezekiah,  
‘This is what the great king, the king of Assyria, says:  
What is this confidence that you have?

## 2 Kings 18:20

You claim—but they are only empty words—"I have a plan and strength for the war."  
Now on whom have you relied, that you have revolted against me?

## 2 Kings 18:21

Now behold, you have relied on the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt,  
on which, if a man leans, it will go into his hand and pierce it.  
So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who rely on him.

## 2 Kings 18:22

But if you say to me, "We have trusted in the Lord our God,"  
is it not He whose high places and altars Hezekiah has taken away,  
and has said to Judah and Jerusalem,  
“You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem”?

## 2 Kings 18:23

Now then, make a wager with my master the king of Assyria,  
and I will give you two thousand horses,  
if you are able on your part to put riders on them.

## 2 Kings 18:24

How then can you turn back even one official of the least of my master’s servants,  
and rely on Egypt for chariots and horsemen?

## 2 Kings 18:25

Have I now come up without the Lord’s consent against this place to destroy it?  
The Lord said to me, “Go up against this land, and destroy it.”’”

---

## 2 Kings 18:26

Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah and Joah, said to Rabshakeh,  
“Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it;  
and do not speak with us in Judean in the hearing of the people who are on the wall.”

## 2 Kings 18:27

But Rabshakeh said to them,  
“Has my master sent me only to your master and to you to speak these words,  
and not to the men who sit on the wall,  
who are doomed to eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you?”

## 2 Kings 18:28

Then Rabshakeh stood and called out with a loud voice in Judean, and said,  
“Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria!

## 2 Kings 18:29

This is what the king says:  
‘Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to deliver you from my hand.

## 2 Kings 18:30

Nor let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord, saying,  
“The Lord will certainly save us, and this city will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.”

## 2 Kings 18:31

Do not listen to Hezekiah; for this is what the king of Assyria says:  
“Make peace with me and come out to me,  
and each of you will eat from his own vine and each from his own fig tree,  
and drink from the waters of his own well,

## 2 Kings 18:32

until I come and take you away to a land like your own land,  
a land of grain and new wine,  
a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive oil and honey,  
so that you will live and not die.”  
But do not listen to Hezekiah, for he misleads you by saying,  
“The Lord will save us.”

## 2 Kings 18:33

Have any of the gods of the nations been able to rescue their land from the hand of the king of Assyria?

## 2 Kings 18:34

What has become of the gods of Hamath and Arpad?  
What has become of the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?  
Have they rescued Samaria from my hand?

## 2 Kings 18:35

Who among all the gods of the lands have saved their land from my hand,  
that the Lord would save Jerusalem from my hand?’”

---

## 2 Kings 18:36

But the people were silent and did not answer him a word,  
for the king’s command was, “Do not answer him.”

## 2 Kings 18:37

Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was over the household,  
and Shebnah the scribe, and Joah son of Asaph the recorder,  
came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn,  
and they reported to him the words of Rabshakeh.
