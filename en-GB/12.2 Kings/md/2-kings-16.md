## 2 Kings 16:1

In the seventeenth year of Pekah son of Remaliah,  
Ahaz son of Jotham, king of Judah, was made king.

## 2 Kings 16:2

Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king,  
and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.  
He did not do what was right in the sight of the Lord his God, as his father David had done.

## 2 Kings 16:3

But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel,  
and he even made his son pass through the fire,  
according to the abominations of the nations whom the Lord had driven out from before the sons of Israel.

## 2 Kings 16:4

He offered sacrifices and burned incense at the high places,  
on the hills, and beneath every green tree.

## 2 Kings 16:5

Then Rezin king of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem for war,  
and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him.

## 2 Kings 16:6

At that time Rezin king of Aram recovered Elath for Aram,  
and drove the Judeans from Elath entirely;  
and the Arameans came to Elath and have lived there to this day.

## 2 Kings 16:7

So Ahaz sent envoys to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying,  
“I am your servant and your son; come to my aid against the king of Aram,  
and the king of Israel, who are rising up against me.”

## 2 Kings 16:8

And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the Lord  
and in the treasuries of the king’s house, and sent it as a gift to the king of Assyria.

## 2 Kings 16:9

So the king of Assyria heeded his request;  
and the king of Assyria went up against Damascus and captured it,  
and led its people into exile to Kir, and executed Rezin.

## 2 Kings 16:10

Now King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria,  
and he saw the altar that was at Damascus.  
And King Ahaz sent to Uriah the priest the pattern of the altar and its model,  
corresponding to all its workmanship.

## 2 Kings 16:11

So Uriah the priest built the altar;  
according to all that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus,  
so Uriah the priest made it before the king came from Damascus.

## 2 Kings 16:12

When the king came from Damascus, the king saw the altar;  
and the king approached the altar and went up to it,

## 2 Kings 16:13

and he burned his burnt offering and his meal offering,  
and poured out his drink offering and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings on the altar.

## 2 Kings 16:14

And the bronze altar, which was before the Lord,  
he moved from the front of the house,  
from between his altar and the house of the Lord,  
and he placed it on the north side of his altar.

## 2 Kings 16:15

Then King Ahaz commanded Uriah the priest, saying,  
“Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering and the evening meal offering,  
and the king’s burnt offering and his meal offering,  
with the burnt offering of all the people of the land,  
and their meal offering and their drink offerings;  
and sprinkle on it all the blood of the burnt offerings and all the blood of the sacrifices.  
But the bronze altar shall be for me to inquire by.”

## 2 Kings 16:16

So Uriah the priest carried out all that King Ahaz instructed.

## 2 Kings 16:17

Then King Ahaz cut off the borders of the stands,  
and removed the wash basin from them;  
he also took down the sea from the bronze oxen that were under it,  
and put it on a pavement of stone.

## 2 Kings 16:18

And he removed the covered canopy for the Sabbath which they had built in the house,  
and the outer entry for the king, from the house of the Lord,  
because of the king of Assyria.

## 2 Kings 16:19

Now the remainder of the acts of Ahaz which he did,  
are they not recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?

## 2 Kings 16:20

So Ahaz slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David,  
and his son Hezekiah became king in his place.
