for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood;  
and the Lord was not willing to forgive.

which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the Lord,  
just as the Lord had said.

## 2 Kings 24:14

all the captains and all the valiant warriors, ten thousand captives,  
and all the craftsmen and the smiths.  
None remained except the poorest people of the land.

he led into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon.

these the king of Babylon brought into exile to Babylon.

following the ways of Jehoiakim.

For it was due to the anger of the Lord that this happened in Jerusalem and Judah,  
until He cast them out from His presence.  
And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
