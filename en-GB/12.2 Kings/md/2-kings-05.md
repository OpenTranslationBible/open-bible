# 2 Kings Chapter 5

## 2 Kings 5:1

Now Naaman, commander of the army of the king of Aram, was a great man in the sight of his master and highly respected,  
because by him the Lord had given victory to Aram.  
The man was also a valiant warrior, but he was a leper.

## 2 Kings 5:2

Now the Arameans had gone out in bands and had taken captive a young girl from the land of Israel;  
and she served Naaman’s wife.

## 2 Kings 5:3

And she spoke to her mistress,  
“If only my master were with the prophet in Samaria!  
He would surely heal him of his leprosy.”

## 2 Kings 5:4

So Naaman went in and told his master, saying,  
“This is what the girl who is from the land of Israel said.”

## 2 Kings 5:5

Then the king of Aram replied,  
“Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel.”  
So he departed, taking with him ten talents of silver, six thousand shekels of gold, and ten changes of clothes.

## 2 Kings 5:6

And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, which said:  
“Now when this letter reaches you, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to you,  
so that you may cure him of his leprosy.”

## 2 Kings 5:7

But when the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes and said,  
“Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man is sending word to me to cure a man of his leprosy?  
But consider now, and see how he is seeking a quarrel with me.”

## 2 Kings 5:8

Now it happened, when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes,  
he sent word to the king, saying,  
“Why have you torn your clothes? Let him come to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.”

## 2 Kings 5:9

So Naaman came with his horses and his chariot, and stood at the doorway of the house of Elisha.

## 2 Kings 5:10

And Elisha sent a messenger to him, instructing,  
“Go and wash in the Jordan seven times,  
and your flesh will be restored to you, and you shall be clean.”

## 2 Kings 5:11

But Naaman was furious and went away, saying,  
“Behold, I thought, ‘He will certainly come out to me and stand,  
and call on the name of the Lord his God, and wave his hand over the place and cure the leper.’

## 2 Kings 5:12

Are Abanah and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, not better than all the waters of Israel?  
Could I not wash in them and be clean?”  
So he turned and went away in rage.

## 2 Kings 5:13

Then his servants approached and spoke to him, and said,  
“My father, had the prophet told you to do something great, would you not have done it?  
How much more then, when he says to you, ‘Wash, and be clean’?”

## 2 Kings 5:14

So he went down and immersed himself seven times in the Jordan, as instructed by the man of God;  
and his flesh was restored like that of a young child, and he was clean.

## 2 Kings 5:15

Then he returned to the man of God with all his company, and came and stood before him.  
And he declared,  
“Behold now, I know that there is no God in all the earth, except in Israel;  
so please accept a gift from your servant now.”

## 2 Kings 5:16

But he said,  
“As surely as the Lord lives, before whom I stand, I will not accept anything.”  
And he urged him to take it, but he refused.

## 2 Kings 5:17

So Naaman said,  
“If not, please let your servant be given two mule-loads of earth;  
for your servant will no longer offer a burnt offering or sacrifice to other gods, but only to the Lord.

## 2 Kings 5:18

In this matter may the Lord pardon your servant:  
when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there,  
and he leans on my hand and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon—  
when I bow myself in the house of Rimmon,  
may the Lord pardon your servant in this matter.”

## 2 Kings 5:19

And he said to him, “Go in peace.”  
So he departed from him a short distance.

## 2 Kings 5:20

But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, thought,  
“Behold, my master has spared this Aramean Naaman, by not accepting from his hand what he brought.  
As the Lord lives, I will run after him and take something from him.”

## 2 Kings 5:21

So Gehazi pursued Naaman.  
When Naaman saw someone running after him, he came down from the chariot to meet him and asked,  
“Is everything well?”

## 2 Kings 5:22

And he said,  
“All is well. My master has sent me, saying,  
‘Behold, just now two young men from the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hill country of Ephraim.  
Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of clothes.’”

## 2 Kings 5:23

Naaman said,  
“Please take two talents.”  
And he urged him and tied up two talents of silver in two bags with two changes of clothes,  
and gave them to two of his servants; and they carried them before him.

## 2 Kings 5:24

When he came to the hill, he took them from their hand and stored them in the house,  
and then sent the men away, and they departed.

## 2 Kings 5:25

But he went in and stood before his master.  
And Elisha asked him,  
“Where have you been, Gehazi?”  
And he replied, “Your servant went nowhere.”

## 2 Kings 5:26

Then he said to him,  
“Did my heart not go with you,  
when the man turned from his chariot to meet you?  
Is it a time to accept money, and to accept clothes, olive groves, vineyards, sheep, oxen, male and female servants?

## 2 Kings 5:27

Therefore the leprosy of Naaman shall cling to you and to your descendants forever.”  
So he went out from his presence leprous, as white as snow.
