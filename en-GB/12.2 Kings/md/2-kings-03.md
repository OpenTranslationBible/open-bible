# 2 Kings Chapter 3

## 2 Kings 3:1

Jehoram son of Ahab became king over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned for twelve years.

## 2 Kings 3:2

He did evil in the sight of the Lord, though not like his father and mother,  
for he removed the sacred pillar of Baal that his father had made.

## 2 Kings 3:3

Nevertheless, he clung to the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin.  
He did not turn away from them.

## 2 Kings 3:4

Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder, and he used to pay the king of Israel a tribute of one hundred thousand lambs and the wool of one hundred thousand rams.

## 2 Kings 3:5

However, following the death of Ahab, the king of Moab rose in rebellion against the king of Israel.

## 2 Kings 3:6

So King Jehoram set out from Samaria at that time and mustered all Israel.

## 2 Kings 3:7

He also sent this message to Jehoshaphat king of Judah:  
“The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to fight against Moab?”  
Jehoshaphat answered, “I will go. I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.”

## 2 Kings 3:8

Then he asked, “Which way shall we go?”  
Jehoram replied, “By way of the wilderness of Edom.”

## 2 Kings 3:9

So the king of Israel, the king of Judah, and the king of Edom set out.  
After a roundabout march of seven days, there was no water for the army or for the animals that followed them.

## 2 Kings 3:10

Then the king of Israel said,  
“Alas! The Lord has summoned these three kings only to deliver them into the hand of Moab!”

## 2 Kings 3:11

But Jehoshaphat said, “Is there no prophet of the Lord here, through whom we may inquire of the Lord?”  
One of the servants of the king of Israel answered, “Elisha son of Shaphat is here. He used to pour water on the hands of Elijah.”

## 2 Kings 3:12

Jehoshaphat said, “The word of the Lord is with him.”  
So the king of Israel, Jehoshaphat, and the king of Edom went down to him.

## 2 Kings 3:13

Elisha said to the king of Israel,  
“What do I have to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father and the prophets of your mother.”  
But the king of Israel said to him, “No, for it is the Lord who has called us three kings together to hand us over to Moab.”

## 2 Kings 3:14

Elisha said,  
“As surely as the Lord of hosts lives, whom I serve,  
if I did not have regard for the presence of Jehoshaphat king of Judah,  
I would not look at you or even notice you.

## 2 Kings 3:15

But now bring me a musician.”  
And as the musician played, the hand of the Lord came upon Elisha.

## 2 Kings 3:16

He said, “This is what the Lord says: Make this valley full of trenches.

## 2 Kings 3:17

For this is what the Lord says:  
You will see neither wind nor rain,

> yet this valley will be filled with water,  
> and you, your cattle, and your animals will drink.

## 2 Kings 3:18

This is a simple thing in the sight of the Lord.  
He will also deliver Moab into your hands.

## 2 Kings 3:19

You will overthrow every fortified city and every major town.  
You will cut down every good tree, stop up all the springs, and ruin every good field with stones.”

## 2 Kings 3:20

The next morning, about the time for the offering of the morning sacrifice,  
suddenly water came from the direction of Edom, and the land was filled with water.

---

## 2 Kings 3:21

Now all the Moabites had heard that the kings had come up to fight against them,  
so every man old enough to bear arms was summoned and stationed at the border.

## 2 Kings 3:22

When they rose early in the morning, the sun was shining on the water,  
and to the Moabites it looked red—like blood.

## 2 Kings 3:23

They said, “This is blood! The kings have fought and slaughtered each other.  
Now to the plunder, Moab!”

## 2 Kings 3:24

But when the Moabites came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and struck them down.  
They fled before Israel, who pursued them and struck them down.

## 2 Kings 3:25

They destroyed the cities,  
and each man threw stones on every good field until it was covered.  
They stopped up all the springs and cut down every good tree.  
Only Kir-hareseth was left, but even that was surrounded and attacked by slingers.

## 2 Kings 3:26

When the king of Moab saw that the battle was going against him,  
he took seven hundred swordsmen to break through to the king of Edom, but they could not prevail.

## 2 Kings 3:27

Then he took his firstborn son, who was to succeed him as king,  
and offered him as a burnt offering on the wall.  
Great wrath came upon Israel, and they withdrew from him and returned to their own land.
