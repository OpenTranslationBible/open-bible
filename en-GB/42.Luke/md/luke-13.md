# Luke Chapter 13

## Luke 13:1

At that time, there were some present who informed Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.

## Luke 13:2

Jesus replied, “Do you suppose that these Galileans were greater sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered this fate?

## Luke 13:3

I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.

## Luke 13:4

Or those eighteen who were killed when the tower in Siloam fell on them—do you think they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem?

## Luke 13:5

I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.”

## Luke 13:6

And He told this parable: “A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came looking for fruit on it but found none.

## Luke 13:7

So he said to the vineyard-keeper, ‘For three years I have been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree and haven’t found any. Cut it down! Why should it use up the soil?’

## Luke 13:8

But he answered, ‘Sir, leave it alone for one more year, and I will dig around it and fertilise it.

## Luke 13:9

If it bears fruit next year, well and good; but if not, then cut it down.’”

## Luke 13:10

One Sabbath, while Jesus was teaching in a synagogue,

## Luke 13:11

there was a woman who had been crippled by a spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not straighten up at all.

## Luke 13:12

When Jesus saw her, He called her over and said, “Woman, you are freed from your infirmity.”

## Luke 13:13

He laid His hands on her, and immediately she straightened up and glorified God.

## Luke 13:14

But the synagogue leader, indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said to the crowd, “There are six days for work. So come and be healed on those days, not on the Sabbath.”

## Luke 13:15

The Lord answered him, “You hypocrites! Does not each of you on the Sabbath untie your ox or donkey from the stall and lead it to water?

## Luke 13:16

Then should not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound for eighteen long years, be freed on the Sabbath day from what bound her?”

## Luke 13:17

When He said this, all His opponents were put to shame, but the people rejoiced at all the glorious things He was doing.

## Luke 13:18

Then Jesus asked, “What is the kingdom of God like? To what shall I compare it?

## Luke 13:19

It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his garden. It grew and became a tree, and the birds of the air nested in its branches.”

---

## Luke 13:20

Again He asked, “To what shall I compare the kingdom of God?

## Luke 13:21

It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into three measures of flour until it was all leavened.”

## Luke 13:22

And He went through the towns and villages, teaching as He made His way to Jerusalem.

## Luke 13:23

Someone inquired of Him, “Lord, will only a few be saved?” He responded to them,

## Luke 13:24

“Strive earnestly to enter through the narrow door, for I tell you many will try but not be able.

## Luke 13:25

Once the owner of the house gets up and shuts the door, you will stand outside knocking and pleading, ‘Sir, open the door for us.’ But He will answer, ‘I do not know you or where you come from.’

## Luke 13:26

Then you will say, ‘We shared meals with you, and you taught among us.’

## Luke 13:27

But He will reply, ‘I do not know where you come from. Depart from me, all you evildoers!’

## Luke 13:28

There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves cast out.

## Luke 13:29

People will come from east and west, and from north and south, and will recline at the table in the kingdom of God.

## Luke 13:30

Indeed, there are those who are last who will be first, and those who are first who will be last.”

---

## Luke 13:31

At that time some Pharisees came to Jesus and said, “Leave this place and go elsewhere. Herod wants to kill you.”

## Luke 13:32

He replied, “Go tell that fox, ‘I will keep on casting out demons and performing healings today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will reach my goal.’

## Luke 13:33

Nevertheless, I must continue my journey today, tomorrow, and the next day—for it is not possible for a prophet to perish outside of Jerusalem.

---

## Luke 13:34

O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who harm the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have desired to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing.

## Luke 13:35

Behold, your house is left to you desolate. I tell you, you will not see me again until you declare, ‘Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.’”
