# Luke Chapter 21

## Luke 21:1

As Jesus looked up, he observed the wealthy placing their gifts into the temple treasury.

He also noticed a poor widow putting in two small copper coins.

## Luke 21:3

And he said, “Truly I tell you, this poor widow has contributed more than all the others;

## Luke 21:4

for they all gave out of their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, put in all she had to live on.”

## Luke 21:5

Some of his disciples were speaking about how the temple was adorned with beautiful stones and dedicated gifts. But Jesus remarked,

## Luke 21:6

“As for these things you are observing, the time will come when not one stone will be left upon another; every one will be torn down.”

## Luke 21:7

They questioned him, “Teacher, when will these things occur? And what will be the sign that they are about to happen?”

## Luke 21:8

He replied, “See that you are not deceived; for many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am he,’ and, ‘The time is near.’ Do not follow them.

## Luke 21:9

When you hear of wars and uprisings, do not be alarmed. These things must happen first, but the end will not come immediately.”

## Luke 21:10

Then he said to them, “Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.

## Luke 21:11

There will be great earthquakes, famines, and pestilences in various places, and terrifying events and great signs from heaven.

## Luke 21:12

“But before all this, they will lay hands on you and persecute you, delivering you to synagogues and prisons, bringing you before kings and governors on account of my name.

## Luke 21:13

This will lead to an opportunity for you to bear witness.

## Luke 21:14

So resolve not to worry beforehand about how to defend yourselves.

## Luke 21:15

For I will provide you with words and wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict.

## Luke 21:16

You will be betrayed even by parents, siblings, relatives, and friends, and some of you will be put to death.

## Luke 21:17

You will be despised by everyone because of my name.

## Luke 21:18

Yet not a single hair on your head will be lost.

## Luke 21:19

By remaining steadfast, you will secure your souls.

## Luke 21:20

“When you see armies surrounding Jerusalem, then understand that its devastation is near.

## Luke 21:21

Then let those in Judea flee to the mountains, let those inside the city depart, and let those in the countryside not enter the city.

## Luke 21:22

For these are the days of vengeance, to fulfil all that is written.

## Luke 21:23

How dreadful it will be for pregnant women and nursing mothers in those days! There will be great distress upon the land and wrath against this people.

## Luke 21:24

They will fall by the sword and be taken captive to all nations. Jerusalem will be trampled by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.

## Luke 21:25

“There will be signs in the sun, moon, and stars. On the earth, nations will be in distress and confusion at the roaring and surging of the sea.

## Luke 21:26

People will faint from terror, apprehensive of what is coming on the world, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.

## Luke 21:27

At that time, they will witness the Son of Man arriving in a cloud with power and great glory.

## Luke 21:28

When these things begin to happen, stand up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.”

## Luke 21:29

He shared this parable with them: “Observe the fig tree and all the trees.

## Luke 21:30

When they begin to sprout leaves, you can see for yourselves and know that summer is approaching.

## Luke 21:31

In the same way, when you see these things happening, recognise that the kingdom of God is near.

## Luke 21:32

Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have taken place.

## Luke 21:33

Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.

## Luke 21:34

“Be careful, or your hearts will be weighed down with dissipation, drunkenness, and the worries of life, and that day will close on you suddenly like a trap.

## Luke 21:35

For it will come upon all who live on the face of the whole earth.

## Luke 21:36

Be always on the watch, and pray that you may have the strength to escape all that is about to happen, and to stand before the Son of Man.”

## Luke 21:37

Each day, Jesus was teaching at the temple, and each evening he went out to spend the night on the hill known as the Mount of Olives,

## Luke 21:38

and all the people would get up early in the morning to hear him at the temple.
