# Luke Chapter 11

## Luke 11:1

It came to pass that while Jesus was praying in a certain place, when He had concluded, one of His disciples approached Him, saying, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples.”

## Luke 11:2

He responded, “When you pray, say:

> ‘Father, hallowed be Your name.
> Your kingdom come.

## Luke 11:3

> Give us each day our daily bread.

## Luke 11:4

> And forgive us our sins,
> for we also forgive everyone who is indebted to us.
> And lead us not into temptation.’”

---

## Luke 11:5

And He said to them, “Suppose one of you has a friend, and goes to him at midnight and says, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves of bread;

## Luke 11:6

because a friend of mine has arrived from a journey, and I have nothing to offer him.’

## Luke 11:7

And suppose the one inside replies, ‘Do not trouble me; the door is already shut, and my children and I are in bed; I cannot get up and give you anything.’

## Luke 11:8

I tell you, even if he will not rise and give him anything because he is his friend, yet due to his persistence, he will rise and give him as much as he needs.

## Luke 11:9

“So I say to you: Ask, and it shall be given to you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you.

## Luke 11:10

For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.

## Luke 11:11

Which of you fathers, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead?

## Luke 11:12

Or if he asks for an egg, will offer him a scorpion?

## Luke 11:13

If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!”

## Luke 11:14

And He was casting out a demon that was mute; when the demon had departed, the man who was mute spoke, and the crowds were astonished.

## Luke 11:15

But some of them said, “He drives out demons by Beelzebul, the prince of demons.”

## Luke 11:16

Others, testing Him, sought a sign from heaven.

## Luke 11:17

But He, knowing their thoughts, said to them: “Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and a house divided against itself falls.

## Luke 11:18

If Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom stand? I say this because you claim I drive out demons by Beelzebul.

## Luke 11:19

If I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your followers drive them out? Therefore, they will be your judges.

## Luke 11:20

But if I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.

## Luke 11:21

When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own house, his possessions are secure.

## Luke 11:22

But when someone stronger attacks and overpowers him, he takes away the armour in which the man trusted and divides his spoils.

## Luke 11:23

Whoever is not with Me is against Me, and whoever does not gather with Me scatters.

## Luke 11:24

“When an unclean spirit departs from a person, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, and not finding any, it says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came.’

## Luke 11:25

When it arrives, it finds the house swept and put in order.

## Luke 11:26

Then it goes and brings seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they enter and dwell there; and the final condition of that person is worse than the first.”

---

## Luke 11:27

As He was saying these things, a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said, “Blessed is the womb that bore You, and the breasts at which You nursed!”

## Luke 11:28

But He said, “Rather, blessed are those who hear the word of God and keep it.”

---

## Luke 11:29

As the crowds increased, He began to say, “This is a wicked generation. It seeks a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.

## Luke 11:30

For just as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so also will the Son of Man be to this generation.

## Luke 11:31

The Queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the people of this generation and condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.

## Luke 11:32

The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.

## Luke 11:33

“No one lights a lamp and places it in a cellar or under a basket, but on a lampstand, so that those who enter may see the light.

## Luke 11:34

Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eyes are healthy, your whole body is full of light. But when they are unhealthy, your body is full of darkness.

## Luke 11:35

Therefore, be careful that the light within you is not darkness.

## Luke 11:36

If your whole body is full of light, with no part dark, it will be fully illuminated, as when a lamp shines its light upon you.”

## Luke 11:37

When He had finished speaking, a Pharisee invited Him to dine with him; so He went in and reclined at the table.

## Luke 11:38

But the Pharisee was surprised to see that He did not first ceremonially wash before the meal.

## Luke 11:39

Then the Lord said to him, “Now you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness.

## Luke 11:40

You foolish ones! Did not He who made the outside make the inside also?

## Luke 11:41

But give what is inside as a charitable gift, and then everything will be clean for you.

---

## Luke 11:42

“Woe to you Pharisees, for you pay tithes of mint, rue, and every kind of garden herb, but neglect justice and the love of God. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others.

## Luke 11:43

Woe to you Pharisees, for you love the most important seats in the synagogues and respectful greetings in the marketplaces.

## Luke 11:44

Woe to you, for you are like unmarked graves, which people walk over without knowing it.”

---

## Luke 11:45

One of the experts in the law answered Him, “Teacher, by saying these things, You insult us also.”

## Luke 11:46

He replied, “Woe to you experts in the law, for you load people with burdens hard to bear, and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers.

## Luke 11:47

Woe to you, for you build tombs for the prophets, and it was your ancestors who killed them.

## Luke 11:48

So you bear witness that you approve of the deeds of your ancestors; they killed the prophets, and you build their tombs.

## Luke 11:49

For this reason, the wisdom of God said, ‘I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they will kill and others they will persecute,’

## Luke 11:50

so that the blood of all the prophets, shed since the foundation of the world, may be charged against this generation,

## Luke 11:51

from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, it will be charged against this generation.

## Luke 11:52

“Woe to you experts in the law, for you have taken away the key of knowledge. You did not enter yourselves, and you hindered those who were entering.”

---

## Luke 11:53

When He left that place, the scribes and the Pharisees began to oppose Him fiercely and to interrogate Him about many things,

## Luke 11:54

plotting to catch Him in something He might say.
