# Luke Chapter 5

## Luke 5:1

On one occasion, as Jesus stood by the Lake of Gennesaret, the crowd was pressing around him, eager to hear the word of God.

## Luke 5:2

He noticed two boats at the water’s edge; the fishermen had left them and were washing their nets.

## Luke 5:3

Jesus entered one of the boats, which belonged to Simon, and asked him to move it a little from the shore. He sat down and taught the people from the boat.

## Luke 5:4

After he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, “Launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.”

## Luke 5:5

Simon replied, “Master, we have toiled all night and caught nothing, but at your word, I will let down the nets.”

## Luke 5:6

When they did this, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to tear.

## Luke 5:7

They signalled to their partners in the other boat to come and assist them. They came and filled both boats so full that they started to sink.

## Luke 5:8

When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus’ knees and said, “Depart from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!”

## Luke 5:9

For he and all his companions were amazed at the catch of fish they had taken,

## Luke 5:10

and so were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. Then Jesus said to Simon, “Do not be afraid; from now on you will catch people.”

## Luke 5:11

So they brought their boats to land, left everything behind, and followed him.

## Luke 5:12

While Jesus was in one of the towns, a man covered with leprosy approached him. Seeing Jesus, he fell on his face and implored, “Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.”

## Luke 5:13

Jesus reached out his hand, touched the man, and said, “I am willing; be clean.” Immediately the leprosy left him.

## Luke 5:14

Jesus instructed him, “Tell no one, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.”

## Luke 5:15

Yet the news about him spread even more, and large crowds gathered to hear him and to be healed of their ailments.

## Luke 5:16

But Jesus often withdrew to solitary places to pray.

## Luke 5:17

One day, as he was teaching, Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there. They had come from every village of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem, and the power of the Lord was present for him to heal the sick.

## Luke 5:18

Some men brought a paralysed man on a mat and tried to lay him before Jesus.

## Luke 5:19

Unable to find a way through the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him on his mat through the tiles into the centre of the crowd, right in front of Jesus.

## Luke 5:20

Observing their faith, Jesus said, “Friend, your sins are forgiven.”

## Luke 5:21

The Pharisees and the teachers of the law began to think, “Who is this man who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?”

## Luke 5:22

Jesus, knowing their thoughts, asked, “Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?

## Luke 5:23

Which is easier: to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’?

## Luke 5:24

But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,” he said to the paralysed man, “I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home.”

## Luke 5:25

Immediately, he stood up before them, took what he had been lying on, and went home glorifying God.

## Luke 5:26

Everyone was amazed and gave praise to God. They were filled with awe and said, “We have seen extraordinary things today.”

## Luke 5:27

After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at his tax booth. “Follow me,” Jesus said to him,

## Luke 5:28

and Levi arose, left everything behind, and followed him.

## Luke 5:29

Levi held a great banquet for Jesus at his house, and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were reclining at the table with them.

## Luke 5:30

The Pharisees and their scribes grumbled to his disciples, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”

## Luke 5:31

Jesus answered them, “It is not those who are well who need a doctor, but those who are sick.

## Luke 5:32

I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”

---

## Luke 5:33

They said to him, “John’s disciples often fast and pray, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink.”

## Luke 5:34

Jesus replied, “Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast while he is with them?

## Luke 5:35

But the time will come when the bridegroom is taken from them; in those days they will fast.”

## Luke 5:36

He told them this parable: “No one tears a piece from a new garment to patch an old one. Otherwise, they will have torn the new garment, and the patch from the new will not match the old.

## Luke 5:37

And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the new wine will burst the skins; the wine will spill out and the skins will be ruined.

## Luke 5:38

Instead, new wine must be placed into fresh wineskins.

## Luke 5:39

And no one after drinking old wine desires the new, for they say, ‘The old is better.’”
