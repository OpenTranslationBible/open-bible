# Luke Chapter 8

## Luke 8:1

Shortly after, Jesus went around from one city and village to another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him,

## Luke 8:2

and also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and illnesses: Mary called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had come out,

## Luke 8:3

Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod’s steward; Susanna; and many others who were supporting them out of their own resources.

## Luke 8:4

As a large crowd was gathering and people from various towns were coming to Jesus, he spoke to them in a parable:

## Luke 8:5

“A sower went out to sow his seed. As he sowed, some fell along the path; it was trampled underfoot, and the birds of the air ate it up.

## Luke 8:6

Some fell on rocky ground, and when it sprang up, it withered because it lacked moisture.

## Luke 8:7

Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up with it and choked it.

## Luke 8:8

Still other seed fell on good soil. It grew up and produced a crop a hundred times more than was sown.” As he said this, he called out, “Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.”

---

## Luke 8:9

His disciples inquired about the meaning of this parable.

## Luke 8:10

He replied, “To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God, but to others I speak in parables, so that,

> ‘though seeing, they may not see;
> though hearing, they may not understand.’

## Luke 8:11

“The parable's meaning is this: The seed represents the word of God.

## Luke 8:12

Those along the path are those who hear, and then the adversary comes and removes the word from their hearts, preventing them from believing and being saved.

## Luke 8:13

Those on rocky ground are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but in a time of testing they fall away.

## Luke 8:14

The seed that fell among thorns represents those who hear, but as they continue on their way, they are overwhelmed by life’s worries, riches, and pleasures, and they do not mature.

## Luke 8:15

But the seed on good soil represents those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and through perseverance produce a crop.

## Luke 8:16

“No one lights a lamp and covers it with a jar or puts it under a bed. Instead, they put it on a lampstand, so that those who come in can see the light.

## Luke 8:17

For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that will not be known and brought to light.

## Luke 8:18

Therefore, be mindful of how you listen. Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what they think they possess will be taken from them.”

---

## Luke 8:19

Now Jesus’ mother and brothers came to see him, but they could not get near him because of the crowd.

## Luke 8:20

Someone informed him, “Your mother and brothers are standing outside, desiring to see you.”

## Luke 8:21

He replied, “My mother and brothers are those who hear God’s word and do it.”

## Luke 8:22

On a certain day, Jesus said to his disciples, “Let us cross to the other side of the lake.” So they got into a boat and set out.

## Luke 8:23

As they sailed, he fell asleep. A squall came down on the lake, so that the boat was being swamped, and they were in danger.

## Luke 8:24

The disciples approached him and woke him, saying, “Master, Master, we’re in peril!” He arose and rebuked the wind and the turbulent waters; the storm subsided, and all was calm.

## Luke 8:25

“Where is your faith?” he asked his disciples. Filled with awe and wonder, they questioned one another, “Who is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him.”

---

## Luke 8:26

They travelled to the region of the Gerasenes, which is across the lake from Galilee.

## Luke 8:27

When Jesus stepped ashore, he was met by a man possessed by demons from the town. For a long time, this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house, but had lived in the tombs.

## Luke 8:28

When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell at his feet, shouting loudly, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don’t torment me!”

## Luke 8:29

For Jesus had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard, he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places.

## Luke 8:30

Jesus inquired of him, “What is your name?” “Legion,” he responded, for many demons had entered him.

## Luke 8:31

And they pleaded with Jesus repeatedly not to send them into the Abyss.

## Luke 8:32

A large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. The demons begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs, and he allowed them.

## Luke 8:33

When the demons left the man, they entered the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and perished.

---

## Luke 8:34

When those tending the pigs observed what had occurred, they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside,

## Luke 8:35

and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had departed, sitting at Jesus’ feet, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.

## Luke 8:36

Those who had witnessed it informed the people how the man possessed by demons had been healed.

## Luke 8:37

Then all the people of the region of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, because they were overwhelmed with fear. So he got into the boat and left.

## Luke 8:38

The man from whom the demons had departed pleaded to accompany him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,

## Luke 8:39

“Return home and tell how much God has done for you.” So the man went away and proclaimed throughout the town how much Jesus had done for him.

## Luke 8:40

Upon Jesus’ return, a crowd welcomed him, for they were all anticipating his arrival.

## Luke 8:41

Then a man named Jairus, a synagogue leader, approached and fell at Jesus’ feet, earnestly requesting him to come to his house

## Luke 8:42

because his only daughter, a girl of about twelve, was dying. As Jesus was on his way, the crowds nearly crushed him.

## Luke 8:43

And a woman was there who had been suffering from bleeding for twelve years, but no one could heal her.

## Luke 8:44

She approached from behind and touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately her bleeding ceased.

## Luke 8:45

“Who touched me?” Jesus inquired. When they all denied it, Peter remarked, “Master, the people are crowding and pressing against you.”

## Luke 8:46

But Jesus said, “Someone has touched me; I know that power has gone out from me.”

## Luke 8:47

Then the woman, realising she could not remain unnoticed, came trembling and fell at his feet. In the presence of all the people, she explained why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed.

## Luke 8:48

Then he said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace.”

---

## Luke 8:49

While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue leader. “Your daughter is dead,” he said. “Don’t trouble the teacher anymore.”

## Luke 8:50

Hearing this, Jesus said to Jairus, “Do not fear; just believe, and she will be healed.”

## Luke 8:51

When he arrived at the house of Jairus, he allowed only Peter, John, and James, along with the child’s father and mother, to enter with him.

## Luke 8:52

Meanwhile, all the people were lamenting and mourning for her. “Cease your weeping,” Jesus said. “She is not dead but asleep.”

## Luke 8:53

They ridiculed him, being certain that she was dead.

## Luke 8:54

But he took her by the hand and said, “My child, arise!”

## Luke 8:55

Her spirit returned, and she immediately stood up. Then Jesus instructed them to give her something to eat.

## Luke 8:56

Her parents were astonished, but he instructed them not to tell anyone what had happened.
