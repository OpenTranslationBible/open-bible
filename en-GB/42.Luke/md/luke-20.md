# Luke Chapter 20

## Luke 20:1

On a certain day, as Jesus was teaching the people in the temple courts and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes, along with the elders, approached Him.

## Luke 20:2

They spoke to Him, saying, “Tell us by what authority You are doing these things, or who is the one who gave You this authority?”

## Luke 20:3

He responded to them, “I will also ask you something. Let me know:

## Luke 20:4

Was John’s baptism from heaven, or from men?”

## Luke 20:5

They reasoned among themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will ask, ‘Why did you not believe him?’

## Luke 20:6

However, if we claim, ‘From men,’ the people will stone us, for they are convinced that John was a prophet.”

## Luke 20:7

So they replied that they did not know where it was from.

## Luke 20:8

Jesus replied, “Then neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.”

## Luke 20:9

Then He began to tell the people this parable: “A man planted a vineyard, leased it to some farmers, and went on a long journey.

## Luke 20:10

At harvest time, he sent a servant to the tenants so that they might give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed.

## Luke 20:11

He sent another servant, but they also beat him and treated him shamefully, sending him away empty-handed.

## Luke 20:12

He sent a third, and this one too they wounded and threw out.

## Luke 20:13

Then the owner of the vineyard pondered, ‘What shall I do? I will send my dear son; perhaps they will show him respect.’

## Luke 20:14

But when the tenants saw him, they conferred among themselves, saying, ‘This is the heir; let us kill him, so that the inheritance may be ours.’

## Luke 20:15

So they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him. What, then, will the owner of the vineyard do to them?

## Luke 20:16

He will come and deal with those tenants and give the vineyard to others.” When the people heard this, they said, “May it never be!”

## Luke 20:17

Jesus looked directly at them and said, “Then what is the meaning of that which is written:

> ‘The stone which the builders rejected
> has become the chief cornerstone’?

## Luke 20:18

Everyone who stumbles over that stone will be broken; but on whomever it falls, it will crush him.”

## Luke 20:19

The scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on Him at that very hour, but they feared the people, for they understood that He had spoken this parable against them.

## Luke 20:20

So they kept a close watch on Him, and sent spies who pretended to be righteous, in order to catch Him in some statement, so they could hand Him over to the jurisdiction and authority of the governor.

## Luke 20:21

The spies questioned Him, saying, “Teacher, we know that You speak and teach rightly, and You do not show partiality, but teach the way of God in truth.

## Luke 20:22

Is it then right for us to pay taxes to Caesar?”

## Luke 20:23

But He, aware of their cunning, said to them,

## Luke 20:24

“Show Me a denarius. Whose image and inscription does it have?” They replied, “Caesar’s.”

## Luke 20:25

He replied, “Then give back to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and to God what belongs to God.”

## Luke 20:26

They were unable to trap Him in what He said in public, and marvelling at His answer, they fell silent.

## Luke 20:27

Some of the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Him with a question.

## Luke 20:28

“Teacher,” they said, “Moses instructed us that if a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, the man must marry the widow and raise up offspring for his brother.

## Luke 20:29

Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a woman and died without children.

## Luke 20:30

Then the second married her, and died

## Luke 20:31

and then the third married her, and died and so it was with all the other brothers, until all seven died, leaving no children.

## Luke 20:32

Lastly, the woman, she also died.

## Luke 20:33

Now then, at the resurrection whose wife will she be, since all seven were married to her?”

## Luke 20:34

Jesus replied, “The people of this world marry and are given in marriage.

## Luke 20:35

But those who are considered worthy of taking part in the age to come and in the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage,

## Luke 20:36

and they can no longer die; for they are like the angels. They are God’s children, being children of the resurrection.

## Luke 20:37

But in the account of the burning bush, even Moses demonstrated that the dead rise, for he refers to the Lord as ‘the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’

## Luke 20:38

He is the God not of the dead, but of the living, for in His sight all are alive.”

## Luke 20:39

Some of the scribes responded, “Well said, Teacher!”

## Luke 20:40

And they did not dare to question Him any longer about anything.

---

## Luke 20:41

Then He said to them, “Why is it said that the Messiah is the son of David?

## Luke 20:42

David himself states in the Book of Psalms: ‘The Lord said to my Lord: “Sit at My right hand

## Luke 20:43

until I make Your enemies a footstool beneath Your feet.”’

## Luke 20:44

David refers to Him as ‘Lord.’ How then can He be his son?”

---

## Luke 20:45

As all the people were listening, He said to His disciples,

## Luke 20:46

“Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces, and the best seats in the synagogues and places of honour at banquets.

## Luke 20:47

They devour widows’ houses and for a show make lengthy prayers. These men will receive greater condemnation.”
