# Luke Chapter 18

## Luke 18:1

Then Jesus was telling them a parable to demonstrate that they should always pray and not become discouraged.

## Luke 18:2

He said, “In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected any person.

## Luke 18:3

And there was a widow in that city who kept coming to him with the plea, ‘Grant me justice against my opponent.’

## Luke 18:4

For a time he was unwilling, but later he said to himself, ‘Even though I do not fear God nor respect any person,

## Luke 18:5

yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she will not eventually come and wear me out.’”

## Luke 18:6

And the Lord said, “Listen to what the unrighteous judge says.

## Luke 18:7

Will not God bring about justice for His chosen ones, who cry out to Him day and night? Will He keep delaying them?

## Luke 18:8

I tell you, He will ensure they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth?”

## Luke 18:9

He also told this parable to some who were confident in their own righteousness and viewed others with contempt:

## Luke 18:10

“Two men went up to the temple to pray, one being a Pharisee and the other was a tax collector.

## Luke 18:11

The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed: ‘God, I thank You that I am not like other people—swindlers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax collector.

## Luke 18:12

I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I acquire.’

## Luke 18:13

But the tax collector stood at a distance. He was unwilling to even raise his eyes to heaven, but beat his chest and said, ‘God, have mercy on me, a sinner.’

## Luke 18:14

I tell you, this man went home justified before God rather than the other. For everyone who exalts themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.”

## Luke 18:15

People were also bringing infants to Him for Him to touch them. But when the disciples saw this, they rebuked them.

## Luke 18:16

But Jesus called the children to Him and said, “Allow the little children to come to Me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.

## Luke 18:17

Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.”

---

## Luke 18:18

A ruler approached Him with a question, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”

## Luke 18:19

Jesus answered, “Why do you call Me good? No one is good except God alone.

## Luke 18:20

You know the commandments: ‘Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honour your father and mother.’”

## Luke 18:21

And he said, “All these I have kept since my youth.”

## Luke 18:22

When Jesus heard this, He said to him, “You still lack one thing. Sell all you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow Me.”

## Luke 18:23

When he heard this, he became very sad, for he was extremely wealthy.

---

## Luke 18:24

Jesus looked at him and said, “How hard it is for the wealthy to enter the kingdom of God!

## Luke 18:25

Truly, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.”

## Luke 18:26

Those listening asked, “Who then can be saved?”

## Luke 18:27

Jesus replied, “The things that are impossible with people are possible with God.”

---

## Luke 18:28

Peter said to Him, “We have left everything we had to follow You!”

## Luke 18:29

Jesus said to them, “Truly I say to you, there is no one who has left house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or children for the sake of the kingdom of God

## Luke 18:30

who will fail to receive many times as much in this age, and in the age to come, eternal life.”

---

## Luke 18:31

Jesus took the Twelve aside and said to them, “We are going up to Jerusalem, and everything written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled.

## Luke 18:32

He will be delivered to the Gentiles. They will mock Him, treat Him with contempt, and spit on Him;

## Luke 18:33

they will scourge Him and put Him to death. On the third day, He will be raised again.”

## Luke 18:34

The disciples understood none of these things. The meaning of this statement was hidden from them, and they did not comprehend what was said.

---

## Luke 18:35

As Jesus was approaching Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging.

## Luke 18:36

When he heard the crowd going by, he inquired what was happening.

## Luke 18:37

They informed him, “Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.”

## Luke 18:38

He called out, “Jesus, Son of David, please have mercy on me!”

## Luke 18:39

Those who led the way sternly told him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”

## Luke 18:40

Jesus stopped and instructed that the man be brought to Him. When he came near, Jesus asked him,

## Luke 18:41

“What do you want Me to do for you?” He replied, “Lord, I want to regain my sight.”

## Luke 18:42

Jesus said to him, “Regain your sight; your faith has made you well.”

## Luke 18:43

Immediately he regained his sight and followed Jesus, glorifying God. When all the people saw it, they gave praise to God.
