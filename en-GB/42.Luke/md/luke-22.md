# Luke Chapter 22

## Luke 22:1

Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, was approaching.

## Luke 22:2

And the chief priests and the scribes were trying to find a way to put Him to death,  
for they were afraid of the people.

## Luke 22:3

And Satan entered Judas, the one called Iscariot, who belonged to the number of the twelve.

## Luke 22:4

And he left and discussed with the chief priests and officers how he was to betray Him to them.

## Luke 22:5

And they were delighted, and agreed to give him money.

## Luke 22:6

So he consented, and began looking for a good opportunity to betray Him to them away from the crowd.

---

## Luke 22:7

Now the first day of Unleavened Bread came, on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed.

## Luke 22:8

And Jesus sent Peter and John, saying,  
“Go and prepare the Passover for us, so that we may eat it.”

## Luke 22:9

They said to Him, “Where do You want us to prepare it?”

## Luke 22:10

And He said to them,  
“When you have entered the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you; follow him into the house that he enters.

## Luke 22:11

And you shall say to the owner of the house,  
‘The Teacher says to you, “Where is the guest room in which I may eat the Passover with My disciples?”’

## Luke 22:12

And he will show you a large, furnished upstairs room; prepare it there.”

## Luke 22:13

And they left and found everything just as He had told them; and they prepared the Passover.

---

## Luke 22:14

When the hour came, He reclined at the table, and the apostles with Him.

## Luke 22:15

And He said to them,  
“I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer;

## Luke 22:16

for I say to you, I shall not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.”

## Luke 22:17

And when He had taken a cup and given thanks, He said,  
“Take this and share it among yourselves;

## Luke 22:18

for I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine from now until the kingdom of God comes.”

## Luke 22:19

And when He had taken some bread and given thanks, He broke it and gave it to them, saying,  
“This is My body, given for you; do this in remembrance of Me.”

## Luke 22:20

And in the same way He took the cup after they had eaten, saying,  
“This cup, which is poured out for you, is the new covenant in My blood.

---

## Luke 22:21

But behold, the hand of the one betraying Me is with Mine on the table.

## Luke 22:22

For indeed, the Son of Man is going as it has been determined;  
but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed!”

## Luke 22:23

And they began to debate among themselves which one of them it was who was going to do this.

---

## Luke 22:24

Now a dispute also developed among them as to which one of them was regarded as being the greatest.

## Luke 22:25

And He said to them,  
“The kings of the Gentiles domineer over them,  
and those who have authority over them are called ‘Benefactors.’

## Luke 22:26

But it is not this way for you; rather, the one who is the greatest among you must become like the youngest,  
and the leader like the servant.

## Luke 22:27

For who is greater: the one who reclines at the table, or the one who serves?  
Is it not the one who reclines at the table? But I am among you as the one who serves.

## Luke 22:28

You are the ones who have stood by Me in My trials;

## Luke 22:29

and just as My Father has granted Me a kingdom, I grant you

## Luke 22:30

that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom,  
and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

---

## Luke 22:31

“Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has demanded to sift you men like wheat;

## Luke 22:32

but I have prayed for you, that your faith will not fail;  
and you, when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.”

## Luke 22:33

But he said to Him,  
“Lord, I am ready to go with You both to prison and to death!”

## Luke 22:34

But He said,  
“I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know Me.”

---

## Luke 22:35

And He said to them,  
“When I sent you out without money belt, bag, or sandals, you did not lack anything, did you?”  
They said, “No, nothing.”

## Luke 22:36

And He said to them,  
“But now, whoever has a money belt is to take it along, likewise also a bag,  
and whoever has no sword is to sell his cloak and buy one.

## Luke 22:37

For I tell you that this which is written must be fulfilled in Me:  
‘And He was counted with wrongdoers’; for that which refers to Me has its fulfilment.”

## Luke 22:38

They said, “Lord, look, here are two swords.” And He said to them, “It is enough.”

---

## Luke 22:39

And He came out and went, as was His habit, to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples also followed Him.

## Luke 22:40

Now when He arrived at the place, He said to them,  
“Pray that you do not come into temptation.”

## Luke 22:41

And He withdrew from them about a stone’s throw, and He knelt down and began to pray,

## Luke 22:42

saying,  
“Father, if You are willing, remove this cup from Me;  
yet not My will, but Yours be done.”

## Luke 22:43

[Now an angel from heaven appeared to Him, strengthening Him.]

## Luke 22:44

And being in agony, He was praying very fervently;  
and His sweat became like drops of blood, falling down upon the ground.

## Luke 22:45

When He rose from prayer, He came to the disciples and found them sleeping from sorrow,

## Luke 22:46

and said to them,  
“Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray that you do not come into temptation.”

---

## Luke 22:47

While He was still speaking, behold, a crowd came,  
and the one called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading the way for them;  
and he approached Jesus to kiss Him.

## Luke 22:48

But Jesus said to him,  
“Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?”

## Luke 22:49

When those who were around Him saw what was going to happen, they said,  
“Lord, shall we strike with the sword?”

## Luke 22:50

And one of them struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear.

## Luke 22:51

But Jesus responded and said,  
“Stop! No more of this.”  
And He touched his ear and healed him.

## Luke 22:52

And Jesus said to the chief priests and officers of the temple and elders who had come against Him,  
“Have you come out with swords and clubs, as you would against a man inciting a revolt?

## Luke 22:53

While I was with you daily in the temple, you did not lay hands on Me;  
but this hour and the power of darkness are yours.”

---

## Luke 22:54

Now they arrested Him and led Him away, and brought Him to the house of the high priest;  
but Peter was following at a distance.

## Luke 22:55

After they kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter was sitting among them.

## Luke 22:56

And a slave woman, seeing him as he sat in the firelight, and staring at him, said,  
“This man was with Him as well.”

## Luke 22:57

But he denied it, saying,  
“I do not know Him, woman!”

## Luke 22:58

And a little later, another person saw him and said,  
“You are one of them too!”  
But Peter said,  
“Man, I am not!”

## Luke 22:59

And after about an hour had passed, another man began to insist, saying,  
“Certainly this man also was with Him, for he, too, is a Galilean!”

## Luke 22:60

But Peter said,  
“Man, I do not know what you are talking about!”  
And immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.

## Luke 22:61

And then the Lord turned and looked at Peter.  
And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had told him,  
“Before a rooster crows today, you will deny Me three times.”

## Luke 22:62

And he went out and wept bitterly.

---

## Luke 22:63

The men who were holding Jesus in custody were mocking Him and beating Him,

## Luke 22:64

and they blindfolded Him and repeatedly asked Him, saying,  
“Prophesy, who is the one who hit You?”

## Luke 22:65

And they were saying many other things against Him, blaspheming.

---

## Luke 22:66

When it was day, the Council of elders of the people assembled, both chief priests and scribes,  
and they brought Him before their Sanhedrin,

## Luke 22:67

saying,  
“If You are the Christ, tell us.”  
But He said to them,  
“If I tell you, you will not believe;

## Luke 22:68

and if I ask a question, you will not answer.

## Luke 22:69

But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.”

## Luke 22:70

And they all said,  
“So You are the Son of God?”  
And He said to them,  
“You say correctly that I am.”

## Luke 22:71

And then they said,  
“What further need do we have of testimony? For we have heard it ourselves from His own mouth!”
