# Luke Chapter 22

## Luke 22:1

Now the Festival of Unleavened Bread, known as the Passover, was drawing near.

## Luke 22:2

The chief priests and the scribes were seeking a way to put Jesus to death, for they feared the people.

## Luke 22:3

Then Satan entered into Judas, called Iscariot, who was one of the Twelve.

## Luke 22:4

Judas went and conferred with the chief priests and the temple officers about how he might betray Jesus to them.

## Luke 22:5

They were pleased and agreed to give him money.

## Luke 22:6

He accepted, and sought an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them away from the crowd.

---

## Luke 22:7

Then came the day of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed.

## Luke 22:8

Jesus sent Peter and John, instructing them, “Go and prepare the Passover for us to eat.”

## Luke 22:9

They asked Him, “Where do you wish us to prepare it?”

## Luke 22:10

He replied, “As you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him to the house he enters,

## Luke 22:11

and say to the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher asks: Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’

## Luke 22:12

He will show you a large, furnished room upstairs. Prepare it there.”

## Luke 22:13

They went and found everything just as He had told them, and they prepared the Passover.

---

## Luke 22:14

When the hour came, He reclined at the table, and the apostles were with Him.

## Luke 22:15

He said to them, “I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.

## Luke 22:16

For I say to you, I will not eat it again until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.”

## Luke 22:17

After taking a cup and giving thanks, He said, “Take this and divide it among yourselves.

## Luke 22:18

For I tell you, I will not drink from the fruit of the vine again until the kingdom of God comes.”

## Luke 22:19

He took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body, given for you; do this in remembrance of me.”

## Luke 22:20

In the same way, after supper, He took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.

---

## Luke 22:21

But behold, the hand of the one betraying me is with mine on the table.

## Luke 22:22

The Son of Man will go as it has been decreed, but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed!”

## Luke 22:23

They began to question among themselves which of them might do this.

---

## Luke 22:24

A dispute also arose among them as to which of them was considered the greatest.

## Luke 22:25

Jesus said to them, “The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and those in authority over them are called Benefactors.

## Luke 22:26

But you are not to be like that. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the leader like the servant.

## Luke 22:27

For who is greater, the one who reclines at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.

## Luke 22:28

You are those who have stood by me in my trials.

## Luke 22:29

And I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me,

## Luke 22:30

so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

---

## Luke 22:31

“Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has asked to sift you all like wheat.

## Luke 22:32

But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.”

## Luke 22:33

But he replied, “Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death.”

## Luke 22:34

Jesus answered, “I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me.”

---

## Luke 22:35

Then Jesus asked them, “When I sent you without purse, bag, or sandals, did you lack anything?” They answered, “Nothing.”

## Luke 22:36

He said to them, “But now, if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you don’t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.

## Luke 22:37

For I tell you, this Scripture must be fulfilled in me: ‘And He was numbered with the transgressors’; for what is written about me is reaching its fulfilment.”

## Luke 22:38

The disciples said, “See, Lord, here are two swords.” He replied, “That’s enough!”

---

## Luke 22:39

Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and His disciples followed Him.

## Luke 22:40

On reaching the place, He said to them, “Pray that you will not fall into temptation.”

## Luke 22:41

He withdrew about a stone’s throw beyond them, knelt down, and prayed,

## Luke 22:42

“Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.”

## Luke 22:43

[An angel from heaven appeared to Him and strengthened Him.]

## Luke 22:44

And being in agony, He prayed more earnestly, and His sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground.

## Luke 22:45

When He rose from prayer and went back to the disciples, He found them asleep, exhausted from sorrow.

## Luke 22:46

“Why are you sleeping?” He asked them. “Get up and pray so that you will not fall into temptation.”

---

## Luke 22:47

While He was still speaking, a crowd came up, and the man called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss Him,

## Luke 22:48

but Jesus asked him, “Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?”

## Luke 22:49

When those around Him saw what was going to happen, they said, “Lord, should we strike with our swords?”

## Luke 22:50

And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear.

## Luke 22:51

But Jesus answered, “No more of this!” And He touched the man’s ear and healed him.

## Luke 22:52

Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard, and the elders who had come for Him, “Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come with swords and clubs?

## Luke 22:53

Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on me. But this is your hour—when darkness reigns.”

---

## Luke 22:54

Then they seized Him, led Him away, and took Him into the house of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance.

## Luke 22:55

When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat among them.

## Luke 22:56

A servant girl saw him seated there in the firelight. She looked closely at him and said, “This man was with Him.”

## Luke 22:57

But he denied it, saying, “Woman, I do not know Him.”

## Luke 22:58

A little later someone else saw him and said, “You also are one of them.” “Man, I am not!” Peter replied.

## Luke 22:59

About an hour later another insisted, “Certainly this fellow was with Him, for he is a Galilean.”

## Luke 22:60

Peter replied, “Man, I do not know what you are talking about!” Just as he was speaking, the rooster crowed.

## Luke 22:61

The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: “Before the rooster crows today, you will deny me three times.”

## Luke 22:62

And he went outside and wept bitterly.

## Luke 22:63

The men who were guarding Jesus began mocking and beating Him.

## Luke 22:64

They blindfolded Him and demanded, “Prophesy! Who hit you?”

## Luke 22:65

And they said many other insulting things to Him.

---

## Luke 22:66

At daybreak, the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and the scribes, assembled, and Jesus was led before them.

## Luke 22:67

“If you are the Messiah,” they said, “tell us.” Jesus answered, “If I tell you, you will not believe;

## Luke 22:68

and if I question you, you will not answer.

## Luke 22:69

But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.”

## Luke 22:70

They all asked, “Are you then the Son of God?” He replied, “You say that I am.”

## Luke 22:71

Then they said, “Why do we need any more testimony? We have heard it from His own lips.”
