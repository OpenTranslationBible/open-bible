# Luke Chapter 22

## Luke 22:1

Now the Festival of Unleavened Bread, known as the Passover, was drawing near.

## Luke 22:2

The chief priests and the scribes were seeking a way to put Jesus to death, for they feared the people.

## Luke 22:3

Then Satan entered into Judas, called Iscariot, who was one of the Twelve.

## Luke 22:4

Judas went and conferred with the chief priests and the temple officers about how he might betray Jesus to them.

## Luke 22:5

They were pleased and agreed to give him money.

## Luke 22:6

He accepted, and sought an opportunity to hand Jesus over to them away from the crowd.

---

## Luke 22:7

Then came the day of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed.

## Luke 22:8

Jesus sent Peter and John, instructing them, “Go and prepare the Passover for us to eat.”

## Luke 22:9

They asked Him, “Where do you wish us to prepare it?”

## Luke 22:10

He replied, “As you enter the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him to the house he enters,

## Luke 22:11

and say to the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher inquires: Where is the guest room for me to eat the Passover with my disciples?’

## Luke 22:12

He will show you a large, furnished room upstairs. Prepare it there.”

## Luke 22:13

They went and found everything just as He had told them, and they prepared the Passover.

---

## Luke 22:14

When the hour came, He reclined at the table, and the apostles were with Him.

## Luke 22:15

He said to them, “I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.

## Luke 22:16

For I tell you, I will not partake of it again until it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of God.”

## Luke 22:17

After taking a cup and giving thanks, He said, “Take this and divide it among yourselves.

## Luke 22:18

For I tell you, I will not drink from the fruit of the vine again until the kingdom of God comes.”

## Luke 22:19

He took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body, given for you; do this in remembrance of me.”

## Luke 22:20

In the same way, after supper, He took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.

---

## Luke 22:21

But see, the hand of the one betraying me is with mine on the table.

## Luke 22:22

The Son of Man will go as it has been decreed, but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed!”

## Luke 22:23

They began to question among themselves which of them might do this.

---

## Luke 22:24

A dispute also arose among them as to which of them was considered the greatest.

## Luke 22:25

Jesus said to them, “The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and those in authority over them are called Benefactors.

## Luke 22:26

But you are not to be like that. Instead, the greatest among you should be like the youngest, and the leader like the servant.

## Luke 22:27

For who is greater, the one who reclines at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at the table? But I am among you as one who serves.

## Luke 22:28

You are those who have stood by me in my trials.

## Luke 22:29

And I confer upon you a kingdom, just as my Father has conferred one upon me,

## Luke 22:30

so that you may dine at my table in my kingdom and take your places on thrones, overseeing the twelve tribes of Israel.

---

## Luke 22:31

“Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has asked to sift you all like wheat.

## Luke 22:32

But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail. And when you have returned, strengthen your brothers.”

## Luke 22:33

But he replied, “Lord, I am ready to accompany you to prison and to death.”

## Luke 22:34

Jesus replied, “I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me.”

---

## Luke 22:35

Then Jesus asked them, “When I sent you without purse, bag, or sandals, did you lack anything?” They answered, “Nothing.”

## Luke 22:36

He said to them, “But now, if you have a purse, take it, and also a bag; and if you do not have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.

## Luke 22:37

For I tell you, this Scripture must be fulfilled in me: ‘And He was numbered with the transgressors’; for what is written about me is reaching its fulfilment.”

## Luke 22:38

The disciples said, “See, Lord, here are two swords.” He replied, “That’s enough!”

---

## Luke 22:39

Jesus went out as He usually did to the Mount of Olives, and His disciples followed Him.

## Luke 22:40

Upon reaching the place, He said to them, “Pray that you will not fall into temptation.”

## Luke 22:41

He withdrew a short distance beyond them, knelt down, and prayed,

## Luke 22:42

“Father, if it is your will, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done.”

## Luke 22:43

[An angel from heaven appeared to Him and strengthened Him.]

## Luke 22:44

And being in agony, He prayed more earnestly, and His sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground.

## Luke 22:45

When He rose from prayer and went back to the disciples, He found them asleep, overwhelmed with sorrow.

## Luke 22:46

“Why are you sleeping?” He asked them. “Rise and pray so that you will not fall into temptation.”

---

## Luke 22:47

While He was still speaking, a crowd came up, and the man called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them. He approached Jesus to kiss Him,

## Luke 22:48

but Jesus asked him, “Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?”

## Luke 22:49

When those around Him saw what was going to happen, they said, “Lord, should we strike with our swords?”

## Luke 22:50

And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, severing his right ear.

## Luke 22:51

But Jesus responded, “No more of this!” And He touched the man’s ear and healed him.

## Luke 22:52

Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard, and the elders who had come for Him, “Have you come out with swords and clubs as if I were leading a rebellion?

## Luke 22:53

Every day I was with you in the temple courts, and you did not lay a hand on me. But this is your hour —when darkness has its way.”

---

## Luke 22:54

Then they seized Him, led Him away, and took Him into the house of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance.

## Luke 22:55

When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat among them.

## Luke 22:56

A servant girl saw him seated there in the firelight. She looked closely at him and said, “This man was with Him.”

## Luke 22:57

But he denied it, saying, “Woman, I do not know Him.”

## Luke 22:58

A little later someone else saw him and said, “You also are one of them.” “Sir, I am not!” Peter replied.

## Luke 22:59

About an hour later another insisted, “Certainly this fellow was with Him, for he is a Galilean.”

## Luke 22:60

Peter replied, “Sir, I do not know what you are talking about!” Just as he was speaking, the rooster crowed.

## Luke 22:61

The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: “Before the rooster crows today, you will deny me three times.”

## Luke 22:62

And he went outside and wept bitterly.

## Luke 22:63

The men who were guarding Jesus began to mock and beat Him.

## Luke 22:64

They blindfolded Him and demanded, “Prophesy! Who struck you?”

## Luke 22:65

And they said many other insulting things to Him.

---

## Luke 22:66

At daybreak, the council of the elders of the people, both the chief priests and the scribes, assembled, and Jesus was led before them.

## Luke 22:67

“If you are the Messiah,” they said, “tell us.” Jesus answered, “If I tell you, you will not believe;

## Luke 22:68

and if I question you, you will not answer.

## Luke 22:69

But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.”

## Luke 22:70

They all asked, “Are you then the Son of God?” He replied, “You say so.”

## Luke 22:71

Then they said, “Why do we need any further testimony? We have heard it from His own lips.”
