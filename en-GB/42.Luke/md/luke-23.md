# Luke Chapter 23

## Luke 23:1

Then the entire assembly arose and brought him to Pilate.

## Luke 23:2

They began to accuse him, saying, “We have found this man misleading our nation and opposing payment of taxes to Caesar, claiming to be Christ, a king.”

## Luke 23:3

Pilate asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?” Jesus replied, “It is as you say.”

## Luke 23:4

Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowd, “I find no basis for a charge against this man.”

## Luke 23:5

But they insisted, “He stirs up the people, teaching throughout Judea, starting from Galilee and coming here.”

---

## Luke 23:6

Upon hearing this, Pilate inquired whether the man was a Galilean.

## Luke 23:7

Upon learning that he was under Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time.

## Luke 23:8

Herod was delighted to see Jesus, as he had wanted to see him for a long time, having heard about him and hoping to see him perform a sign.

## Luke 23:9

He questioned him at length, but Jesus gave him no answer.

## Luke 23:10

The chief priests and the scribes stood there, vehemently accusing him.

## Luke 23:11

Herod, with his soldiers, treated him with contempt and mocked him. Dressing him in an elegant robe, they sent him back to Pilate.

## Luke 23:12

That day Herod and Pilate became friends; previously, they had been enemies.

---

## Luke 23:13

Pilate gathered the chief priests, the rulers, and the people,

## Luke 23:14

and said, “You brought me this man as one inciting the people to rebellion. I have examined him in your presence and found no basis for your charges against him.

## Luke 23:15

Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us; as you see, he has done nothing deserving death.

## Luke 23:16

Therefore, I will discipline him and then release him.”

## Luke 23:17

[Now he was obliged to release one prisoner to them at the festival.]

## Luke 23:18

But the whole crowd shouted, “Remove this man! Release Barabbas to us!”

## Luke 23:19

(Barabbas had been thrown into prison for a rebellion in the city and for murder.)

## Luke 23:20

Desiring to release Jesus, Pilate addressed them again.

## Luke 23:21

Yet they persisted, crying out, “Crucify him! Crucify him!”

## Luke 23:22

For the third time he spoke to them: “Why? What crime has this man committed? I find no grounds for a death sentence. Therefore, I will discipline him and release him.”

## Luke 23:23

But they were insistent, with loud shouts demanding that he be crucified, and their voices prevailed.

## Luke 23:24

Thus, Pilate decided to grant their demand.

## Luke 23:25

He released the man who had been imprisoned for insurrection and murder, the one they asked for, and handed Jesus over to their will.

---

## Luke 23:26

As they led him away, they seized Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the countryside, and placed the cross on him to carry behind Jesus.

## Luke 23:27

A large crowd followed, including women who mourned and lamented for him.

## Luke 23:28

Jesus turned to them and said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep for yourselves and for your children.

## Luke 23:29

For the time will come when you will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.’

## Luke 23:30

At that time,

> they will call to the mountains, ‘Fall on us!’
> and to the hills, ‘Cover us!’

## Luke 23:31

For if people do these things when the tree is full of life, what will happen when it is withered?”

---

## Luke 23:32

Two others, both criminals, were also led out with him to face execution.

## Luke 23:33

Upon reaching the place known as the Skull, they crucified him there with the criminals—one on his right, the other on his left.

## Luke 23:34

Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they are unaware of their actions.” And they divided up his clothes by casting lots.

## Luke 23:35

The people stood watching, and the rulers sneered at him, saying, “He saved others; let him save himself if he is God’s Messiah, the Chosen One.”

## Luke 23:36

The soldiers also mocked him, offering him sour wine

## Luke 23:37

and they joked, “If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself.”

## Luke 23:38

Above him was a sign stating: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

---

## Luke 23:39

One of the criminals hanging there insulted him: “Aren’t you the Messiah? Save yourself and us!”

## Luke 23:40

But the other criminal admonished him. “Do you not fear God,” he said, “since you are under the same sentence?

## Luke 23:41

We are punished justly, for we are receiving what our deeds deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong.”

## Luke 23:42

Then he pleaded, “Jesus, remember me when you enter your kingdom.”

## Luke 23:43

Jesus replied to him, “Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise.”

---

## Luke 23:44

By about noon, darkness fell over the whole land until three in the afternoon,

## Luke 23:45

for the sun ceased to shine. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two.

## Luke 23:46

Jesus called out loudly, “Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.” Having said this, he breathed his last.

## Luke 23:47

The centurion, witnessing what had happened, praised God and said, “Surely this was a righteous man.”

## Luke 23:48

When all the people who had gathered to witness this event saw what took place, they beat their breasts and went away.

## Luke 23:49

But all those who knew him, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, observing these things.

---

## Luke 23:50

Now there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, who was good and upright,

## Luke 23:51

who had not agreed with their decision and action. He came from the Judean town of Arimathea and was waiting for the kingdom of God.

## Luke 23:52

Approaching Pilate, he requested Jesus’ body.

## Luke 23:53

Then he took it down, wrapped it in linen cloth, and laid it in a tomb cut in the rock, one that had never been used.

## Luke 23:54

It was the preparation day, and the Sabbath was drawing near.

## Luke 23:55

The women who had accompanied Jesus from Galilee followed Joseph and saw the tomb and how his body was laid in it.

## Luke 23:56

Then they went home and prepared spices and perfumes. But they rested on the Sabbath in accordance with the commandment.
