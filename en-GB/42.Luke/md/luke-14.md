# Luke Chapter 14

## Luke 14:1

On a Sabbath, as Jesus went to dine at the house of a leader among the Pharisees, they were observing Him intently.

## Luke 14:2

In front of Him was a man afflicted with severe swelling.

## Luke 14:3

Jesus posed a question to the Pharisees and legal experts, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not?”

## Luke 14:4

But they remained silent. So He took hold of the man, healed him, and sent him away.

## Luke 14:5

And He said to them, “If any of you has a son or an ox that falls into a well on the Sabbath day, will you not immediately pull him out?”

## Luke 14:6

And they could not respond to this.

## Luke 14:7

Observing how the guests chose the places of honour at the table, He told them a parable:

## Luke 14:8

“When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honour, lest someone more distinguished than you has been invited.

## Luke 14:9

The host who invited both of you will then come and say, ‘Give your place to this person,’ and you will be embarrassed and take the least important place.

## Luke 14:10

But when you are invited, go and sit at the lowest place, so that when your host comes, he will say to you, ‘Friend, move up higher.’ Then you will be honoured in front of all the other guests.

## Luke 14:11

For everyone who exalts themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.”

---

## Luke 14:12

Then Jesus said to His host, “When you give a luncheon or dinner, do not invite your friends, your siblings, your relatives, or your wealthy neighbours, lest they also invite you in return and you are repaid.

## Luke 14:13

But when you host a banquet, invite the poor, the disabled, the lame, and the blind,

## Luke 14:14

and you will be blessed. Though they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.”

## Luke 14:15

When one of those reclining at the table with Him heard this, he said to Jesus, “Blessed is the one who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God.”

## Luke 14:16

Jesus replied, “A man was preparing a great banquet and invited many guests.

## Luke 14:17

At the time of the banquet, he sent his servant to say to those who had been invited, ‘Come, for everything is now ready.’

## Luke 14:18

But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said, ‘I have bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please excuse me.’

## Luke 14:19

Another said, ‘I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to try them out. Please excuse me.’

## Luke 14:20

Still another said, ‘I have just married, so I cannot come.’

## Luke 14:21

The servant returned and reported this to his master. The owner of the house became angry and ordered his servant, ‘Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in the poor, the disabled, the blind, and the lame.’

## Luke 14:22

‘Master,’ the servant said, ‘what you ordered has been done, but there is still room.’

## Luke 14:23

Then the master told his servant, ‘Go out to the roads and country lanes and compel them to come in, so that my house will be full.

## Luke 14:24

I tell you, none of those who were invited will taste my banquet.’”

## Luke 14:25

Large crowds were travelling with Jesus, and He turned and said to them:

## Luke 14:26

“If anyone comes to Me and does not hate their father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters—yes, even their own life—such a person cannot be My disciple.

## Luke 14:27

And whoever does not carry their own cross and follow Me cannot be My disciple.

## Luke 14:28

Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Will you not first sit down and calculate the cost to see if you have enough to complete it?

## Luke 14:29

For if you lay the foundation and are unable to finish it, everyone who sees it will ridicule you,

## Luke 14:30

saying, ‘This person began to build and was not able to finish.’

## Luke 14:31

Or suppose a king is about to go to war against another king. Will he not first sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand men to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand?

## Luke 14:32

If he is not able, he will send a delegation while the other is still far off and will ask for terms of peace.

## Luke 14:33

In the same way, those of you who do not give up everything you have cannot be My disciples.

## Luke 14:34

“Salt is good, but if it loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again?

## Luke 14:35

It is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure heap; it is thrown out. Whoever has ears to hear, let them hear.”
