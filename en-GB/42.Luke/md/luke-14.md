# Luke Chapter 14

## Luke 14:1

It happened that when Jesus went into the house of one of the leaders of the Pharisees on the Sabbath to eat bread,  
they were watching Him closely.

## Luke 14:2

And there in front of Him was a man suffering from dropsy.

## Luke 14:3

And Jesus responded and said to the lawyers and Pharisees,  
“Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not?”

## Luke 14:4

But they kept silent.  
And He took hold of him, and healed him, and sent him away.

## Luke 14:5

And He said to them,  
“Which one of you will have a son or an ox fall into a well,  
and will not immediately pull him out on a Sabbath day?”

## Luke 14:6

And they could offer no reply to this.

## Luke 14:7

Now He began telling a parable to the invited guests when He noticed how they had been picking out the places of honour at the table.

## Luke 14:8

“When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast,  
do not take the place of honour, for someone more distinguished than you may have been invited by him,

## Luke 14:9

and the one who invited you both will come and say to you,  
‘Give your place to this person,’  
and then in disgrace you will proceed to occupy the last place.

## Luke 14:10

But when you are invited, go and take the last place,  
so that when the one who has invited you comes, he will say to you,  
‘Friend, move up higher’;  
then you will have honour in the sight of all who are dining at the table with you.

## Luke 14:11

For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and the one who humbles himself will be exalted.”

---

## Luke 14:12

Now He also went on to say to the one who had invited Him,  
“When you give a luncheon or a dinner,  
do not invite your friends, nor your brothers, nor your relatives, nor wealthy neighbours,  
otherwise they may also invite you in return and that will be your repayment.

## Luke 14:13

But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the disabled, the lame, the blind;

## Luke 14:14

and you will be blessed, since they do not have the means to repay you;  
for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.”

## Luke 14:15

When one of those who were reclining at the table with Him heard this, he said to Him,  
“Blessed is everyone who will eat bread in the kingdom of God!”

## Luke 14:16

But He said to him,  
“A man was giving a big dinner, and he invited many;

## Luke 14:17

and at the dinner hour he sent his slave to tell those who had been invited,  
‘Come, for everything is ready now.’

## Luke 14:18

And yet they all alike began to make excuses.  
The first one said to him,  
‘I have purchased a field and I need to go out to look at it; please consider me excused.’

## Luke 14:19

Another one said,  
‘I have purchased five yoke of oxen, and I am going to try them out; please consider me excused.’

## Luke 14:20

Another one said,  
‘I have married a wife, and for that reason I cannot come.’

## Luke 14:21

And the slave came back and reported this to his master.  
Then the head of the household became angry and said to his slave,  
‘Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the city,  
and bring in here those who are poor, disabled, blind, and lame.’

## Luke 14:22

And later the slave said,  
‘Master, what you commanded has been done, and still there is room.’

## Luke 14:23

And the master said to the slave,  
‘Go out into the roads and the hedges, and press upon them to come in,  
so that my house may be filled.

## Luke 14:24

For I tell you, none of those men who were invited shall taste my dinner.’”

---

## Luke 14:25

Now large crowds were going along with Him, and He turned and said to them,

## Luke 14:26

“If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters,  
yes, and even his own life, he cannot be My disciple.

## Luke 14:27

Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after Me cannot be My disciple.

---

## Luke 14:28

For which one of you, when he wants to build a tower,  
does not first sit down and calculate the cost, to see if he has enough to complete it?

## Luke 14:29

Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish,  
all who are watching it will begin to ridicule him,

## Luke 14:30

saying, ‘This person began to build, and was not able to finish!’

## Luke 14:31

Or what king, when he sets out to meet another king in battle,  
will not first sit down and consider whether he is strong enough with ten thousand men  
to face the one coming against him with twenty thousand?

## Luke 14:32

Otherwise, while the other is still far away, he sends a delegation and requests terms of peace.

## Luke 14:33

So then, none of you can be My disciple who does not give up all his own possessions.

## Luke 14:34

“Therefore, salt is good; but if even salt has become tasteless, with what will it be seasoned?

## Luke 14:35

It is useless either for the soil or for the manure pile, so it is thrown out.  
The one who has ears to hear, let him hear.”
