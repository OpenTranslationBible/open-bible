# Luke Chapter 15

## Luke 15:1

Now the tax collectors and sinners were all approaching to listen to Jesus.

## Luke 15:2

And the Pharisees and the scribes were complaining, saying, “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.”

## Luke 15:3

So He told them this parable:

## Luke 15:4

“Which one of you, having a hundred sheep and losing one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the open field and go after the one that is lost until he finds it?

## Luke 15:5

And when he finds it, he joyfully places it on his shoulders.

## Luke 15:6

And upon returning home, he calls together his friends and neighbours, saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found my lost sheep.’

## Luke 15:7

I tell you, in the same way, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who do not need repentance.

---

## Luke 15:8

“Or what woman, having ten silver coins and losing one, does not light a lamp, sweep the house, and search diligently until she finds it?

## Luke 15:9

And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbours together, saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin I lost.’

## Luke 15:10

In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”

## Luke 15:11

And He said, “A man had two sons.

## Luke 15:12

The younger one said to his father, ‘Father, give me my share of the estate.’ So he divided his property between them.

## Luke 15:13

Not long after, the younger son gathered all he had and journeyed to a distant country, where he squandered his wealth in reckless living.

## Luke 15:14

After he had spent everything, a severe famine arose in that country, and he began to be in want.

## Luke 15:15

So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed pigs.

## Luke 15:16

He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.

## Luke 15:17

When he came to his senses, he said, ‘How many of my father’s hired servants have food to spare, and here I am starving to death!

## Luke 15:18

I will arise and go to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.

## Luke 15:19

I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants.’

## Luke 15:20

So he arose and went to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion; he ran to his son, embraced him, and kissed him.

## Luke 15:21

The son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’

## Luke 15:22

But the father said to his servants, ‘Quickly, bring out the best robe and put it on him; put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.

## Luke 15:23

Bring the fattened calf and slaughter it. Let us eat and celebrate.

## Luke 15:24

For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’ And they began to celebrate.

---

## Luke 15:25

Meanwhile, the older son was in the field, and as he approached the house, he heard music and dancing.

## Luke 15:26

So he called one of the servants and asked what was happening.

## Luke 15:27

‘Your brother has come,’ he replied, ‘and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.’

## Luke 15:28

The older brother became angry and refused to go in. So his father went out and pleaded with him.

## Luke 15:29

But he answered his father, ‘Look! All these years I’ve been serving you and have never disobeyed your commands, yet you never gave me even a young goat to celebrate with my friends.

## Luke 15:30

But when this son of yours returns, who has squandered your property with prostitutes, you kill the fattened calf for him!’

## Luke 15:31

‘Son,’ the father said, ‘you are always with me, and all that I have is yours.

## Luke 15:32

But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’”
