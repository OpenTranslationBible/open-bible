# Luke Chapter 7

## Luke 7:1

When Jesus had completed all His teachings in the hearing of the people, He went into Capernaum.

## Luke 7:2

There was a centurion’s servant, highly valued by him, who was ill and on the verge of death.

## Luke 7:3

The centurion, having heard about Jesus, sent some Jewish elders to Him, asking Him to come and heal his servant.

## Luke 7:4

When they reached Jesus, they earnestly urged Him, saying, “He is worthy for You to do this for him,

## Luke 7:5

for he loves our nation and has built our synagogue.”

## Luke 7:6

So Jesus went with them. He was not far from the house when the centurion sent friends to say to Him, “Lord, do not trouble Yourself further, for I am not worthy to have You come under my roof.

## Luke 7:7

That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to You. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed.

## Luke 7:8

For I too am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I say to one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”

## Luke 7:9

When Jesus heard this, He was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd following Him, He said, “I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such great faith.”

## Luke 7:10

When the messengers returned to the house, they found the servant restored to health.

## Luke 7:11

Soon afterwards, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and His disciples and a large crowd went with Him.

## Luke 7:12

As He approached the town gate, a dead man was being carried out—the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. A large crowd from the town was with her.

## Luke 7:13

When the Lord saw her, He had compassion on her and said, “Do not weep.”

## Luke 7:14

Then He went up and touched the bier, and the bearers stood still. He said, “Young man, I say to you, arise!”

## Luke 7:15

The man who had died sat up and began to speak, and Jesus returned him to his mother.

## Luke 7:16

They were all filled with awe and glorified God. “A great prophet has appeared among us,” they said. “God has visited His people.”

## Luke 7:17

This account of Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding region.

## Luke 7:18

John’s disciples reported to him about all these things. Summoning two of them,

## Luke 7:19

he sent them to the Lord to ask, “Are You the one who is to come, or should we expect another?”

## Luke 7:20

When the men came to Jesus, they said, “John the Baptist has sent us to You to ask, ‘Are You the one who is to come, or should we expect another?’”

## Luke 7:21

At that time, Jesus cured many people of diseases, afflictions, and evil spirits, and gave sight to many who were blind.

## Luke 7:22

So He replied to the messengers, “Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive sight, the lame walk, those with leprosy are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is proclaimed to the poor.

## Luke 7:23

Blessed is anyone who does not stumble because of Me.”

---

## Luke 7:24

After John’s messengers had left, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed swayed by the wind?

## Luke 7:25

If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? No, those who wear splendid clothing and live in luxury are in palaces.

## Luke 7:26

But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and even more than a prophet.

## Luke 7:27

This is the one about whom it is written:

> ‘Behold, I will send my messenger ahead of you,
> who will prepare your way before you.’

## Luke 7:28

I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet even the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.”

## Luke 7:29

(All the people, including the tax collectors, when they heard Jesus’ words, acknowledged God’s justice, having been baptised by John.

## Luke 7:30

But the Pharisees and the experts in the law rejected God’s purpose for themselves, not having been baptised by John.)

## Luke 7:31

“To what then can I compare the people of this generation, and what are they like?

## Luke 7:32

They resemble children sitting in the marketplace and calling to each other:

> ‘We played the flute for you,
> and you did not dance;
> we sang a dirge,
> and you did not weep.’

## Luke 7:33

For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, ‘He is possessed.’

## Luke 7:34

The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.’

## Luke 7:35

Yet wisdom is proven right by all her children.”

## Luke 7:36

One of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him, and He went to the Pharisee’s house and reclined at the table.

## Luke 7:37

A woman in the town who was a sinner learned that He was eating at the Pharisee’s house, so she brought an alabaster jar of perfume.

## Luke 7:38

Standing behind Him at His feet weeping, she began to wet His feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed them, and poured perfume on them.

## Luke 7:39

When the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he thought to himself, “If this man were a prophet, He would know who is touching Him and what kind of woman she is—that she is a sinner.”

## Luke 7:40

Jesus responded to him, “Simon, I have something to say to you.” “Say it, Teacher,” he replied.

## Luke 7:41

“A moneylender had two debtors. One owed him five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.

## Luke 7:42

When they were unable to repay, he forgave the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?”

## Luke 7:43

Simon answered, “I suppose the one who had the larger debt forgiven.” “You have judged correctly,” Jesus said.

## Luke 7:44

Then turning towards the woman, He said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you provided no water for My feet, but she has wet My feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.

## Luke 7:45

You did not give Me a kiss, but she has not stopped kissing My feet since I came in.

## Luke 7:46

You did not anoint My head with oil, but she has poured perfume on My feet.

## Luke 7:47

Therefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven, as her great love has shown. But whoever has been forgiven little loves little.”

## Luke 7:48

Then Jesus assured her, “Your sins are forgiven.”

## Luke 7:49

The other guests began to wonder among themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?”

## Luke 7:50

And He told the woman, “Your faith has saved you; go forth in peace.”
