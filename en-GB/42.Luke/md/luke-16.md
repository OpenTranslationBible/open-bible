# Luke Chapter 16

## Luke 16:1

Jesus said to His disciples, “There was a wealthy man who had a steward, and this steward was reported to him for squandering his possessions.

## Luke 16:2

So he called him and asked, ‘What is this I hear about you? Provide an account of your stewardship, for you can no longer be steward.’

## Luke 16:3

The steward said to himself, ‘What shall I do, since my master is taking the stewardship away from me? I am not strong enough to dig; I am too ashamed to beg.

## Luke 16:4

I know what I shall do, so that when I am removed from the stewardship, people will welcome me into their homes.’

## Luke 16:5

So he summoned each of his master’s debtors. He asked the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’

## Luke 16:6

He replied, ‘A hundred measures of oil.’ The steward said to him, ‘Take your bill, sit down quickly, and write fifty.’

## Luke 16:7

Then he asked another, ‘And how much do you owe?’ He replied, ‘A hundred measures of wheat.’ He said to him, ‘Take your bill, and write eighty.’

## Luke 16:8

The master praised the dishonest steward because he had acted shrewdly; for the children of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than the children of light.

## Luke 16:9

And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of worldly wealth, so that when it is gone, they may welcome you into eternal dwellings.

## Luke 16:10

Whoever is faithful with very little is also faithful with much; and whoever is dishonest with very little is also dishonest with much.

## Luke 16:11

If you have not been faithful with worldly wealth, who will entrust true riches to you?

## Luke 16:12

And if you have not been trustworthy with what belongs to someone else, who will give you what is truly yours?

## Luke 16:13

No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.

## Luke 16:14

The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things and were sneering at Him.

## Luke 16:15

He said to them, “You are the ones who justify yourselves in the sight of others, but God knows your hearts; for what is highly esteemed among people is detestable in God’s sight.

## Luke 16:16

The Law and the Prophets were proclaimed until John; since then, the good news of the kingdom of God is being preached, and everyone is forcing their way into it.

## Luke 16:17

But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one stroke of a letter in the Law to fail.

## Luke 16:18

Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and anyone who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.

## Luke 16:19

There was a wealthy man who wore purple and fine linen, and enjoyed a luxurious life every day.

## Luke 16:20

At his gate was laid a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores,

## Luke 16:21

and desiring to eat what fell from the wealthy man's table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores.

## Luke 16:22

The time came when the poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham’s side. The rich man also died and was buried.

## Luke 16:23

In the place of the dead, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side.

## Luke 16:24

So he called out, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in agony in this flame.’

## Luke 16:25

But Abraham said, ‘Son, remember that during your life you received your good things, and Lazarus likewise bad things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in agony.

## Luke 16:26

And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, so that those who want to cross from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross from there to us.’

## Luke 16:27

He said, ‘Then I plead with you, father, to send him to my father’s house—

## Luke 16:28

for I have five brothers—so that he may warn them, lest they also come to this place of torment.’

## Luke 16:29

But Abraham said, ‘They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.’

## Luke 16:30

He said, ‘No, father Abraham, but if someone from the dead visits them, they will repent.’

## Luke 16:31

But he said to him, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.’”
