# Luke Chapter 17

## Luke 17:1

Jesus said to His disciples, “It is inevitable that stumbling blocks will come, but woe to the person through whom they come!

## Luke 17:2

It would be better for that person to have a millstone hung around their neck and be thrown into the sea than to cause one of these little ones to sin.

## Luke 17:3

Be on your guard! If your brother or sister sins against you, rebuke them; and if they repent, forgive them.

## Luke 17:4

Even if they sin against you seven times in a day and come back to you seven times saying, ‘I repent,’ you must forgive them.”

## Luke 17:5

The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith!”

## Luke 17:6

The Lord replied, “If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea,’ and it would obey you.

## Luke 17:7

“Suppose one of you has a servant ploughing or tending sheep. Would you say to the servant when he comes in from the field, ‘Come now and sit down to eat’?

## Luke 17:8

Would you not rather say, ‘Prepare my supper, get yourself ready and serve me while I eat and drink; after that you may eat and drink’?

## Luke 17:9

Would you thank the servant because he did what he was commanded to do?

## Luke 17:10

So you also, when you have done everything you were told to do, should say, ‘We are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty.’”

## Luke 17:11

While Jesus was on His way to Jerusalem, He travelled along the border between Samaria and Galilee.

## Luke 17:12

As He was entering a village, ten men with leprosy met Him. They stood at a distance

## Luke 17:13

and called out in a loud voice, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!”

## Luke 17:14

When He saw them, He said, “Go, show yourselves to the priests.” And as they went, they were cleansed.

## Luke 17:15

One of them, when he saw he was healed, came back, praising God in a loud voice.

## Luke 17:16

He threw himself at Jesus’ feet and thanked Him—and he was a Samaritan.

## Luke 17:17

Jesus asked, “Were not all ten cleansed? Where are the other nine?

## Luke 17:18

Has no one returned to give glory to God except this foreigner?”

## Luke 17:19

Then He said to him, “Rise and go; your faith has made you well.”

---

## Luke 17:20

Once, being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, Jesus replied, “The coming of the kingdom of God is not something that can be observed,

## Luke 17:21

nor will people say, ‘Here it is,’ or ‘There it is,’ because the kingdom of God is in your midst.”

---

## Luke 17:22

Then He said to His disciples, “The days are coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it.

## Luke 17:23

People will say to you, ‘Look, there he is!’ or ‘Here he is!’ Do not go running off after them.

## Luke 17:24

For the Son of Man in His day will be like the lightning, which flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other.

## Luke 17:25

But first He must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.

---

## Luke 17:26

Just as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man.

## Luke 17:27

People were eating, drinking, marrying and being given in marriage up to the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all.

## Luke 17:28

It was the same in the days of Lot. People were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building.

## Luke 17:29

But the day Lot left Sodom, fire and sulphur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.

## Luke 17:30

It will be just like this on the day the Son of Man is revealed.

---

## Luke 17:31

On that day no one on the housetop, with possessions inside, should go down to get them. Likewise, no one in the field should go back for anything.

## Luke 17:32

Remember Lot’s wife!

## Luke 17:33

Whoever tries to keep their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life will preserve it.

---

## Luke 17:34

I tell you, on that night two people will be in one bed; one will be taken and the other left.

## Luke 17:35

Two women will be grinding grain together; one will be taken and the other left.

## Luke 17:36

[Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left.”]

---

## Luke 17:37

“Where, Lord?” they asked. He replied, “Where there is a dead body, there the vultures will gather.”
