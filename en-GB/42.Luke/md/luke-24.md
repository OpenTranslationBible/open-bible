# Luke Chapter 24

## Luke 24:1

But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came to the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.

## Luke 24:2

And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb,

## Luke 24:3

but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.

## Luke 24:4

While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men suddenly stood near them in gleaming clothing;

## Luke 24:5

and as the women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them,  
“Why are you seeking the living One among the dead?

## Luke 24:6

He is not here, but He has risen. Remember how He spoke to you while He was still in Galilee,

## Luke 24:7

saying that the Son of Man must be handed over to sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise from the dead.”

## Luke 24:8

And they remembered His words,

## Luke 24:9

and returned from the tomb and reported all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.

## Luke 24:10

Now these women were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James;  
also the other women with them were telling these things to the apostles.

## Luke 24:11

But these words appeared to them as nonsense, and they would not believe the women.

## Luke 24:12

Nevertheless, Peter got up and ran to the tomb;  
and when he stooped and looked in, he saw the linen wrappings only;  
and he went away to his home, marveling at what had happened.

## Luke 24:13

And behold, on that very day two of them were going to a village named Emmaus,  
which was sixty stadia from Jerusalem.

## Luke 24:14

And they were talking with each other about all these things which had taken place.

## Luke 24:15

While they were talking and discussing, Jesus Himself approached and began travelling with them.

## Luke 24:16

But their eyes were kept from recognising Him.

## Luke 24:17

And He said to them,  
“What are these words that you are exchanging with one another as you are walking?”  
And they came to a stop, looking sad.

## Luke 24:18

One of them, named Cleopas, answered and said to Him,  
“Are You possibly the only one living near Jerusalem who does not know about the things that happened here in these days?”

## Luke 24:19

And He said to them, “What sort of things?”  
And they said to Him,  
“The things about Jesus the Nazarene, who proved to be a prophet mighty in deed and word  
in the sight of God and all the people,

## Luke 24:20

and how the chief priests and our rulers handed Him over to be sentenced to death, and crucified Him.

## Luke 24:21

But we were hoping that it was He who was going to redeem Israel.  
Indeed, besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened.

## Luke 24:22

But also some women among us left us bewildered. When they were at the tomb early in the morning,

## Luke 24:23

and did not find His body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that He was alive.

## Luke 24:24

And so some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it exactly as the women also had said;  
but Him they did not see.”

## Luke 24:25

And He said to them,  
“You foolish men and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!

## Luke 24:26

Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and to come into His glory?”

## Luke 24:27

Then beginning with Moses and with all the Prophets,  
He explained to them the things written about Himself in all the Scriptures.

---

## Luke 24:28

And they approached the village where they were going, and He gave the impression that He was going farther.

## Luke 24:29

And they strongly urged Him, saying,  
“Stay with us, for it is getting toward evening, and the day is now nearly over.”  
So He went in to stay with them.

## Luke 24:30

And it came about, when He had reclined at the table with them,  
that He took the bread and blessed it, and He broke it and began giving it to them.

## Luke 24:31

And then their eyes were opened and they recognised Him;  
and He vanished from their sight.

## Luke 24:32

They said to one another,  
“Were our hearts not burning within us when He was speaking to us on the road,  
while He was explaining the Scriptures to us?”

## Luke 24:33

And they got up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem,  
and found the eleven gathered together and those who were with them,

## Luke 24:34

saying,  
“The Lord has really risen and has appeared to Simon!”

## Luke 24:35

They began to relate their experiences on the road,  
and how He was recognised by them at the breaking of the bread.

## Luke 24:36

Now while they were telling these things,  
Jesus Himself suddenly stood in their midst and _said to them_,  
“Peace be to you.”

## Luke 24:37

But they were startled and frightened, and thought that they were looking at a spirit.

## Luke 24:38

And He said to them,  
“Why are you frightened, and why are doubts arising in your hearts?

## Luke 24:39

See My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself;  
touch Me and see, because a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you plainly see that I have.”

## Luke 24:40

And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and His feet.

## Luke 24:41

While they still could not believe it because of their joy and astonishment,  
He said to them, “Have you anything here to eat?”

## Luke 24:42

They served Him a piece of broiled fish;

## Luke 24:43

and He took it and ate it in front of them.

---

## Luke 24:44

Now He said to them,  
“These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you,  
that all the things that are written about Me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.”

## Luke 24:45

Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures,

## Luke 24:46

and He said to them,  
“So it is written, that the Christ would suffer and rise from the dead on the third day,

## Luke 24:47

and that repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.

## Luke 24:48

You are witnesses of these things.

## Luke 24:49

And behold, I am sending the promise of My Father upon you;  
but you are to stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.”

---

## Luke 24:50

And He led them out as far as Bethany, and He lifted up His hands and blessed them.

## Luke 24:51

While He was blessing them, He parted from them and was carried up into heaven.

## Luke 24:52

And they, after worshiping Him, returned to Jerusalem with great joy,

## Luke 24:53

and were continually in the temple, praising God.
