# Luke Chapter 24

## Luke 24:1

On the first day of the week, at early dawn, the women came to the tomb bringing the spices they had prepared.

## Luke 24:2

They discovered the stone rolled away from the tomb,

## Luke 24:3

but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.

## Luke 24:4

While they were perplexed about this, suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood near them.

## Luke 24:5

In their fright, the women bowed their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, “Why do you seek the living among the dead?

## Luke 24:6

He is not here; He has risen! Remember how He spoke to you while He was still in Galilee,

## Luke 24:7

saying that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, be crucified, and on the third day rise again.”

## Luke 24:8

Then they remembered His words.

## Luke 24:9

Upon returning from the tomb, they shared all these things with the eleven and with everyone else.

## Luke 24:10

Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them conveyed this to the apostles.

## Luke 24:11

But their words seemed to them like nonsense, and they did not believe the women.

## Luke 24:12

However, Peter got up and ran to the tomb. Stooping down, he saw the linen wrappings by themselves, and he went away, marvelling at what had happened.

## Luke 24:13

That same day, two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about sixty stadia from Jerusalem.

## Luke 24:14

They were talking with each other about all that had happened.

## Luke 24:15

While they were discussing these things, Jesus Himself approached and began walking with them;

## Luke 24:16

but their eyes were kept from recognising Him.

## Luke 24:17

He asked them, “What are these matters you are discussing as you walk along?” They stood still, looking sad.

## Luke 24:18

One of them, named Cleopas, answered, “Are you the only one visiting Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?”

## Luke 24:19

“What things?” He asked. They replied, “The things about Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,

## Luke 24:20

and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him up to be sentenced to death, and crucified Him.

## Luke 24:21

But we had hoped that He was the one who was going to redeem Israel. And besides all this, it is the third day since these things happened.

## Luke 24:22

Moreover, some women among us amazed us. They went to the tomb early this morning

## Luke 24:23

and did not find His body. They came saying they had seen a vision of angels, who said He was alive.

## Luke 24:24

Then some of those with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had described, but they did not see Him.”

## Luke 24:25

He said to them, “How foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!

## Luke 24:26

Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and then enter into His glory?”

## Luke 24:27

And starting with Moses and all the Prophets, He clarified to them what was mentioned in all the Scriptures about Himself.

## Luke 24:28

As they approached the village to which they were going, He acted as if He were going farther.

## Luke 24:29

But they urged Him strongly, saying, “Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over.” So He went in to stay with them.

## Luke 24:30

While at the table with them, He took bread, gave thanks, broke it, and began to share it with them.

## Luke 24:31

Then their eyes were opened and they recognised Him, and He vanished from their sight.

## Luke 24:32

They asked each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us while He talked with us on the road and revealed the Scriptures to us?”

## Luke 24:33

They got up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem. There they found the eleven and those with them, assembled together

## Luke 24:34

and saying, “The Lord has truly risen and has appeared to Simon.”

## Luke 24:35

Then the two recounted what had happened on the way, and how He was recognised by them in the breaking of the bread.

---

## Luke 24:36

While they were still talking about this, Jesus Himself stood among them and said, “Peace be with you.”

## Luke 24:37

They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a spirit.

## Luke 24:38

He said to them, “Why are you troubled, and why do doubts come into your hearts?

## Luke 24:39

Look at My hands and My feet. It is I Myself! Touch Me and see; a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.”

## Luke 24:40

When He had said this, He showed them His hands and His feet.

## Luke 24:41

While they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, He asked them, “Do you have anything here to eat?”

## Luke 24:42

They gave Him a piece of broiled fish,

## Luke 24:43

and He took it and ate it in their presence.

---

## Luke 24:44

He said to them, “These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about Me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms.”

## Luke 24:45

Then He opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures.

## Luke 24:46

He told them, “This is what is written: The Messiah will endure suffering and rise from the dead on the third day,

## Luke 24:47

and repentance for the forgiveness of sins will be proclaimed in His name to all nations, starting at Jerusalem.

## Luke 24:48

You are witnesses of these things.

## Luke 24:49

Behold, I am sending the promise of My Father upon you; but stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.”

---

## Luke 24:50

When He had led them out as far as Bethany, He lifted up His hands and blessed them.

## Luke 24:51

As He was blessing them, He departed from them and was carried up into heaven.

## Luke 24:52

After worshipping Him, they returned to Jerusalem with great joy,

## Luke 24:53

and they remained continually at the temple, praising God.
