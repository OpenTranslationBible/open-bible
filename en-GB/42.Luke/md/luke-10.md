# Luke Chapter 10

## Luke 10:1

After this, the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them in pairs ahead of him to every city and place where he himself was about to go.

## Luke 10:2

He said to them, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Therefore, ask the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest field.

## Luke 10:3

Go! Behold, I am sending you out like lambs among wolves.

## Luke 10:4

Carry no purse, no bag, no sandals, and do not greet anyone along the road.

## Luke 10:5

When you enter a house, first say, ‘Peace be to this house.’

## Luke 10:6

If a person of peace is there, your peace will rest on them; if not, it will return to you.

## Luke 10:7

Stay in that house, eating and drinking what they provide, for the worker deserves his wages. Do not move from house to house.

## Luke 10:8

When you enter a town and are welcomed, eat what is set before you.

## Luke 10:9

Heal the sick there and tell them, ‘The kingdom of God has come near to you.’

## Luke 10:10

But when you enter a town and are not welcomed, go into its streets and say,

## Luke 10:11

‘Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet we wipe off against you. Yet be sure of this: the kingdom of God has come near.’

## Luke 10:12

I tell you, it will be more tolerable on that day for Sodom than for that town.

## Luke 10:13

“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.

## Luke 10:14

But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you.

## Luke 10:15

And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted to the heavens? No, you will be brought down to Hades.

## Luke 10:16

“Whoever listens to you listens to me; whoever rejects you rejects me; and whoever rejects me rejects the one who sent me.”

## Luke 10:17

The seventy-two returned with joy, saying, “Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name.”

## Luke 10:18

He said to them, “I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.

## Luke 10:19

I have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy; nothing will harm you.

## Luke 10:20

Nevertheless, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.”

## Luke 10:21

At that time, Jesus, full of joy through the Holy Spirit, said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this was your good pleasure.

## Luke 10:22

“All things have been handed over to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.”

## Luke 10:23

Then he turned to his disciples and said privately, “Blessed are the eyes that see what you see.

## Luke 10:24

For I tell you that many prophets and kings wanted to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.”

## Luke 10:25

On one occasion, an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. “Teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?”

## Luke 10:26

“What is written in the Law?” he replied. “How do you read it?”

## Luke 10:27

He answered, “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind’; and, ‘Love your neighbour as yourself.’”

## Luke 10:28

“You have answered correctly,” Jesus replied. “Do this and you will live.”

## Luke 10:29

But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, “And who is my neighbour?”

## Luke 10:30

In reply, Jesus said: “A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he was attacked by robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead.

## Luke 10:31

By chance, a priest was going down that road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side.

## Luke 10:32

So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.

## Luke 10:33

But a Samaritan, as he travelled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him.

## Luke 10:34

He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own animal, brought him to an inn and took care of him.

## Luke 10:35

The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper. ‘Look after him,’ he said, ‘and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.’

## Luke 10:36

“Which of these three do you think was a neighbour to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?”

## Luke 10:37

The expert in the law replied, “The one who showed mercy on him.” Jesus told him, “Go and do likewise.”

## Luke 10:38

As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came to a village where a woman named Martha opened her home to him.

## Luke 10:39

She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord’s feet listening to his word.

## Luke 10:40

But Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made. She came to him and asked, “Lord, don’t you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!”

## Luke 10:41

“Martha, Martha,” the Lord answered, “you are worried and upset about many things,

## Luke 10:42

but only one thing is needed. Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her.”
