# Luke Chapter 2

## Luke 2:1

In those days, a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that a census should be conducted of the whole inhabited earth.

## Luke 2:2

For this was the first census conducted during the time of Quirinius the governor of Syria.

## Luke 2:3

And everyone went to register, each to their own city.

## Luke 2:4

Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David,

## Luke 2:5

to register with Mary, who was betrothed to him and was expecting a child.

## Luke 2:6

While they were there, the time arrived for her to deliver her child.

## Luke 2:7

And she gave birth to her firstborn son, wrapped him in cloths, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.

---

## Luke 2:8

In the same region, there were shepherds living out in the fields, keeping watch over their flocks by night.

## Luke 2:9

An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were greatly afraid.

## Luke 2:10

But the angel reassured them, “Fear not, for I bring you good news of great joy for all people.

## Luke 2:11

For today, in the city of David, a Saviour has been born to you; he is Christ the Lord.

## Luke 2:12

This will be your sign: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.”

## Luke 2:13

And suddenly, along with the angel, there was a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,

## Luke 2:14

> “Glory to God in the highest heaven,
> and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased.”

---

## Luke 2:15

When the angels had gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.”

## Luke 2:16

So they hurried and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in the manger.

## Luke 2:17

When they had seen him, they spread the word about what had been told them concerning this child.

## Luke 2:18

And all who heard it were astonished at what the shepherds told them.

## Luke 2:19

But Mary kept all these things in her heart, reflecting on them.

## Luke 2:20

The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, just as they had been told.

---

## Luke 2:21

When eight days were completed for the circumcision of the child, he was named Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived.

---

## Luke 2:22

When the days for their purification according to the Law of Moses were completed, they brought him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord

## Luke 2:23

(as it is written in the Law of the Lord, “Every firstborn male shall be consecrated to the Lord”),

## Luke 2:24

and to make an offering as required by the Law of the Lord: “a pair of turtle-doves or two young pigeons.”

---

## Luke 2:25

Now there was a man in Jerusalem named Simeon, who was righteous and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.

## Luke 2:26

It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.

## Luke 2:27

Guided by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts. When the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what the custom of the Law required,

## Luke 2:28

Simeon embraced him and praised God, saying,

## Luke 2:29

> “Lord, now you are letting your servant depart in peace,
> according to your word;

## Luke 2:30

> for my eyes have seen your salvation,

## Luke 2:31

> which you have prepared in the sight of all peoples:

## Luke 2:32

> a light for revelation to the Gentiles,
> and the glory of your people Israel.”

---

## Luke 2:33

The child's parents were in awe of what was spoken about him.

## Luke 2:34

Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother, “This child is destined to cause the fall and rise of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be opposed,

## Luke 2:35

so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce your own soul as well.”

---

## Luke 2:36

There was also a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was very old; she had lived with her husband for seven years after her marriage,

## Luke 2:37

and then had been a widow until she was eighty-four. She never left the temple but worshipped night and day, fasting and praying.

## Luke 2:38

Approaching them at that very moment, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were anticipating the redemption of Jerusalem.

---

## Luke 2:39

When they had completed everything required by the Law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city of Nazareth.

## Luke 2:40

And the child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.

---

## Luke 2:41

Every year, his parents went to Jerusalem for the Feast of the Passover.

## Luke 2:42

When he was twelve years old, they went up to the festival as was their custom.

## Luke 2:43

After the festival concluded, while his parents were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but they were unaware of it.

## Luke 2:44

Thinking he was in their company, they travelled for a day and then began looking for him among their relatives and friends.

## Luke 2:45

When they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem to look for him.

## Luke 2:46

After three days, they discovered him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.

## Luke 2:47

All who heard him were impressed by his understanding and his answers.

## Luke 2:48

When his parents saw him, they were amazed. His mother said to him, “Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you.”

## Luke 2:49

He replied, “Why were you searching for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father’s house?”

## Luke 2:50

Yet they did not comprehend what he was saying to them.

## Luke 2:51

Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. Meanwhile, his mother kept all these things in her heart.

## Luke 2:52

And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and people.
