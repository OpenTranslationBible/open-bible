# Luke Chapter 9

## Luke 9:1

When Jesus called the Twelve together, He bestowed upon them power and authority over all demons and to heal diseases.

## Luke 9:2

He sent them to announce the kingdom of God and to cure the sick.

## Luke 9:3

He instructed them, “Take nothing for the journey—neither staff, nor bag, nor bread, nor money; and do not have an extra tunic.”

## Luke 9:4

“Whatever house you enter, remain there until you depart from that place.”

## Luke 9:5

“If people do not welcome you, leave that town and shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.”

## Luke 9:6

So they departed and went through the villages, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere.

## Luke 9:7

Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was happening, and he was perplexed because some were saying that John had been raised from the dead,

## Luke 9:8

others that Elijah had appeared, and still others that one of the prophets of old had risen.

## Luke 9:9

Herod said, “I beheaded John. Who, then, is this about whom I hear such things?” And he sought to see Him.

---

## Luke 9:10

When the apostles returned, they reported to Jesus all they had done. He took them with Him and withdrew privately to a town called Bethsaida.

## Luke 9:11

But the crowds learned of it and followed Him. He welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those in need of healing.

## Luke 9:12

As the day was drawing to a close, the Twelve approached Him and said, “Send the crowd away so they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside to find lodging and food, for we are in a secluded place.”

## Luke 9:13

He replied, “You give them something to eat.” They answered, “We have only five loaves and two fish—unless we go and buy food for all this crowd.”

## Luke 9:14

(There were about five thousand men.) But He said to His disciples, “Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each.”

## Luke 9:15

The disciples complied, and everyone sat down.

## Luke 9:16

Taking the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He gave thanks, broke them, and gave them to the disciples to distribute to the people.

## Luke 9:17

They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples collected twelve baskets full of broken pieces that were left over.

---

## Luke 9:18

While Jesus was praying in private, and the disciples were with Him, He asked them, “Who do the crowds say I am?”

## Luke 9:19

They answered, “Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, that one of the prophets of old has come back to life.”

## Luke 9:20

“But what about you?” He asked. “Who do you say I am?” Peter answered, “The Christ of God.”

---

## Luke 9:21

Jesus strictly instructed them not to tell this to anyone.

## Luke 9:22

He said, “The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, and be killed and be raised on the third day.”

---

## Luke 9:23

Then He said to them all, “If anyone wishes to follow Me, he must deny himself, take up his cross daily, and follow Me.”

## Luke 9:24

“For whoever seeks to preserve his life will lose it, but whoever gives up his life for My sake will find it.”

## Luke 9:25

“What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet lose or forfeit their very self?”

## Luke 9:26

“Whoever is ashamed of Me and My words, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of them when He comes in His glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.”

## Luke 9:27

“Truly I tell you, some who are standing here will not experience death before they see the kingdom of God.”

---

## Luke 9:28

About eight days after Jesus spoke these words, He took Peter, John, and James with Him and went up onto a mountain to pray.

## Luke 9:29

As He was praying, His face altered in appearance, and His clothes became brilliantly white.

## Luke 9:30

Two men, Moses and Elijah, appeared in radiant glory, conversing with Jesus.

## Luke 9:31

They discussed His departure, which He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.

## Luke 9:32

Peter and his companions were quite sleepy, but when they were fully awake, they saw His glory and the two men standing with Him.

## Luke 9:33

As the men were leaving Jesus, Peter said to Him, “Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters—one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” (He was unaware of what he was saying.)

## Luke 9:34

While he was speaking, a cloud appeared and enveloped them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.

## Luke 9:35

A voice came from the cloud, saying, “This is My Son, My Chosen One; listen to Him.”

## Luke 9:36

When the voice had spoken, they found Jesus was alone. The disciples kept this to themselves and did not disclose to anyone at that time what they had witnessed.

---

## Luke 9:37

The next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met Him.

## Luke 9:38

A man in the crowd called out, “Teacher, I implore You to look at my son, for he is my only child.”

## Luke 9:39

“A spirit seizes him and he suddenly screams; it throws him into convulsions so that he foams at the mouth. It scarcely ever leaves him and is harming him.”

## Luke 9:40

“I asked Your disciples to drive it out, but they could not.”

## Luke 9:41

Jesus answered, “You unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I stay with you and put up with you? Bring your son here.”

## Luke 9:42

Even while the boy was coming, the demon threw him to the ground in a convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the impure spirit, healed the boy, and returned him to his father.

## Luke 9:43

And they were all amazed at the greatness of God. While everyone was marvelling at all that Jesus did, He said to His disciples,

## Luke 9:44

“Pay close attention to what I am about to tell you: The Son of Man is going to be handed over to men.”

## Luke 9:45

But they did not understand what this meant. It was hidden from them, so they did not grasp it, and they were afraid to ask Him about it.

---

## Luke 9:46

A dispute arose among the disciples as to which of them would be the greatest.

## Luke 9:47

Jesus, aware of their thoughts, took a little child and had him stand beside Him.

## Luke 9:48

Then He said to them, “Whoever welcomes this little child in My name welcomes Me; and whoever welcomes Me welcomes the one who sent Me. For it is the one who is least among you all who is the greatest.”

---

## Luke 9:49

“Master,” said John, “we saw someone driving out demons in Your name and we tried to stop him, because he is not one of us.”

## Luke 9:50

“Do not stop him,” Jesus said, “for whoever is not opposed to you is for you.”

---

## Luke 9:51

As the time approached for Him to be taken up to heaven, Jesus steadfastly set out for Jerusalem.

## Luke 9:52

He sent messengers on ahead, who went into a Samaritan village to prepare for Him;

## Luke 9:53

but the people there did not welcome Him, because He was heading for Jerusalem.

## Luke 9:54

When the disciples James and John saw this, they asked, “Lord, do You want us to call fire down from heaven to destroy them?”

## Luke 9:55

But Jesus turned and rebuked them.

## Luke 9:56

Then He and His disciples moved on to another village.

---

## Luke 9:57

As they were walking along the road, someone said to Him, “I will follow You wherever You go.”

## Luke 9:58

Jesus replied, “Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to rest His head.”

## Luke 9:59

He said to another man, “Follow Me.” But he replied, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.”

## Luke 9:60

Jesus said to him, “Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and announce the kingdom of God.”

## Luke 9:61

Still another said, “I will follow You, Lord; but first let me go back and bid farewell to my family.”

## Luke 9:62

Jesus replied, “No one who puts a hand to the plough and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.”
