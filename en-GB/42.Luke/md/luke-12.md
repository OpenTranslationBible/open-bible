# Luke Chapter 12

## Luke 12:1

In these circumstances, as a multitude of thousands had gathered, so that they were stepping on one another, He began to speak first to His disciples, saying, “Be wary of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.

## Luke 12:2

For there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed, nor hidden that will not be made known.

## Luke 12:3

Therefore, what you have spoken in the dark will be heard in the light, and what you have whispered in the inner rooms will be proclaimed upon the rooftops.

## Luke 12:4

“I say to you, My friends, do not fear those who kill the body and after that can do no more.

## Luke 12:5

But I will show you whom you should fear: fear Him who, after He has killed, has the power to cast into hell; yes, I tell you, fear Him.

## Luke 12:6

Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten before God.

## Luke 12:7

Indeed, even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Do not fear; you are worth more than many sparrows.

---

## Luke 12:8

“I tell you, everyone who acknowledges Me before others, the Son of Man will also acknowledge before the angels of God.

## Luke 12:9

But whoever denies Me before others will be denied before the angels of God.

## Luke 12:10

And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.

## Luke 12:11

When you are brought before synagogues, rulers, and authorities, do not be anxious about how to defend yourselves or what you will say,

## Luke 12:12

for the Holy Spirit will teach you at that moment what you ought to say.”

## Luke 12:13

Someone in the crowd said to Him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.”

## Luke 12:14

But He replied, “Man, who appointed Me a judge or an arbitrator over you?”

## Luke 12:15

Then He said to them, “Beware and be on your guard against every form of greed; for life does not consist in an abundance of possessions.”

## Luke 12:16

And He told them a parable, saying, “The land of a certain rich man was very productive.

## Luke 12:17

And he thought to himself, ‘What shall I do, since I have no place to store my crops?’

## Luke 12:18

Then he said, ‘Here is what I will do: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods.

## Luke 12:19

And I will say to my soul, “You have many goods laid up for many years; take your ease, eat, drink, and be merry.”’

## Luke 12:20

But God said to him, ‘You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you; and now who will own what you have prepared?’

## Luke 12:21

This is how it will be for anyone who stores up treasure for themselves but is not rich towards God.”

---

## Luke 12:22

Then He said to His disciples, “For this reason I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat; nor about your body, what you will wear.

## Luke 12:23

For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing.

## Luke 12:24

Consider the ravens: they neither sow nor reap, they have no storeroom nor barn, yet God feeds them. How much more valuable are you than the birds!

## Luke 12:25

Which of you by worrying can add a single hour to your life’s span?

## Luke 12:26

If you cannot do even a very little thing, why do you worry about the rest?

## Luke 12:27

Consider the lilies, how they grow: they neither labour nor spin; yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendour was clothed like one of these.

## Luke 12:28

If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, how much more will He clothe you—O you of little faith!

## Luke 12:29

And do not set your heart on what you will eat or drink; do not keep worrying.

## Luke 12:30

For all these things the nations of the world eagerly seek; and your Father knows that you need them.

## Luke 12:31

Instead, strive for His kingdom, and these things will be provided to you as well.

## Luke 12:32

Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father delights in giving you the kingdom.

## Luke 12:33

Sell your possessions and give to charity; provide purses for yourselves that do not wear out, a treasure in heaven that will never fail, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys.

## Luke 12:34

For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

## Luke 12:35

“Be ready for service and keep your lamps burning,

## Luke 12:36

like servants waiting for their master to return from a wedding feast, so that when he comes and knocks they can immediately open the door for him.

## Luke 12:37

Blessed are those servants whom the master finds watching when he comes. Truly I tell you, he will dress himself to serve, have them recline at the table, and will come and serve them.

## Luke 12:38

It will be good for those servants whose master finds them ready, whether he comes in the second watch, or even in the third watch.

## Luke 12:39

But be sure of this: if the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have allowed his house to be broken into.

## Luke 12:40

You also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.”

---

## Luke 12:41

Peter asked, “Lord, are You telling this parable to us, or to everyone else?”

## Luke 12:42

And the Lord replied, “Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom the master puts in charge of his servants, to give them their rations at the proper time?

## Luke 12:43

Blessed is that servant whom his master finds doing so when he returns.

## Luke 12:44

Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his possessions.

## Luke 12:45

But if that servant says in his heart, ‘My master is delaying his coming,’ and begins to beat the other servants, both men and women, and to eat and drink and get drunk,

## Luke 12:46

the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know, and will cut him in two, and assign him a place with the unbelievers.

## Luke 12:47

“The servant who knows his master’s will and does not get ready or does not do what his master wants will be beaten with many blows.

## Luke 12:48

But the one who does not know and does things deserving punishment will be beaten with few blows. From everyone who has been given much, much will be required; and from the one who has been entrusted with much, even more will be asked.

---

## Luke 12:49

“I have come to bring fire upon the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled!

## Luke 12:50

But I have a baptism to undergo, and how distressed I am until it is completed!

## Luke 12:51

Do you think I came to bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but rather division.

## Luke 12:52

From now on there will be five in one household divided, three against two and two against three.

## Luke 12:53

They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.”

---

## Luke 12:54

He also said to the crowds, “When you see a cloud rising in the west, you immediately say, ‘A shower is coming,’ and it does.

## Luke 12:55

And when you feel a south wind blowing, you say, ‘It will be hot,’ and it is.

## Luke 12:56

You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky, but how is it that you do not know how to interpret this present time?

---

## Luke 12:57

“And why do you not judge for yourselves what is right?

## Luke 12:58

As you are going with your adversary to the magistrate, make an effort to be reconciled on the way, so that he does not drag you before the judge, and the judge hand you over to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.

## Luke 12:59

I tell you, you will not be released until you have paid the last penny.”
