# Luke Chapter 6

## Luke 6:1

On a Sabbath, Jesus was passing through some grainfields, and His disciples began to pick the heads of grain, rub them in their hands, and eat the kernels.

## Luke 6:2

Some of the Pharisees questioned, “Why are you doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?”

## Luke 6:3

Jesus replied to them, “Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?

## Luke 6:4

He entered the house of God, took the consecrated bread, and ate what is only lawful for priests to eat, and he also gave some to his companions.”

## Luke 6:5

And He told them, “The Son of Man is master of the Sabbath.”

## Luke 6:6

On another Sabbath, He went into the synagogue and was teaching, and there was a man there whose right hand was withered.

## Luke 6:7

The scribes and Pharisees were watching Him closely to see if He would heal on the Sabbath, so they might find a reason to accuse Him.

## Luke 6:8

But He knew their thoughts and said to the man with the withered hand, “Get up and stand in front of everyone.” So he got up and stood there.

## Luke 6:9

Then Jesus said to them, “I ask you, is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save a life or to destroy it?”

## Luke 6:10

After looking around at them all, He said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He did so, and his hand was restored.

## Luke 6:11

But they were filled with rage and began to discuss with one another what they might do to Jesus.

---

## Luke 6:12

At that time, Jesus went out to a mountainside to pray, and spent the whole night in prayer to God.

## Luke 6:13

When morning came, He called His disciples to Him and chose twelve of them, whom He also named apostles:

## Luke 6:14

Simon (whom He called Peter), his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew,

## Luke 6:15

Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon known as the Zealot,

## Luke 6:16

Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who later betrayed Him.

---

## Luke 6:17

He went down with them and stood on a level place. A large crowd of His disciples was there, and a great multitude of people from all Judea, from Jerusalem, and from the coastal region of Tyre and Sidon,

## Luke 6:18

who had come to hear Him and to be healed of their diseases. Those troubled by unclean spirits were cured,

## Luke 6:19

and everyone was trying to touch Him, because power was coming from Him and healing them all.

---

## Luke 6:20

Looking at His disciples, He said:

> “Blessed are you who are poor,
> for yours is the kingdom of God.

## Luke 6:21

> Blessed are you who hunger now,
> for you will be satisfied.
> Blessed are you who weep now,
> for you will laugh.

## Luke 6:22

> Blessed are you when people hate you,
> exclude you, insult you,
> and scorn your name as evil,
> on account of the Son of Man.

## Luke 6:23

Rejoice on that day and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven. For that is how their ancestors treated the prophets.

---

## Luke 6:24

> But woe to you who are rich,
> for you have already received your comfort.

## Luke 6:25

> Woe to you who are well-fed now,
> for you will go hungry.
> Woe to you who laugh now,
> for you will mourn and weep.

## Luke 6:26

> Woe to you when everyone speaks well of you,
> for that is how their ancestors treated the false prophets.

---

## Luke 6:27

“But to those of you who are listening, I say: Love your enemies, and do good to those who hate you,

## Luke 6:28

speak well of those who curse you, and pray for those who mistreat you.

## Luke 6:29

If someone strikes you on one cheek, offer them the other also. If someone takes your coat, do not withhold your shirt from them.

## Luke 6:30

Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not insist on getting it back.

## Luke 6:31

Do to each other as you would have it done to you.

---

## Luke 6:32

If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? Even those who are not righteous love those who love them.

## Luke 6:33

And if you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? Even those who are not righteous do the same.

## Luke 6:34

And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what credit is that to you? Even those who are not righteous lend to others like themselves, expecting to be repaid in full.

## Luke 6:35

But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend without expecting anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High, because He is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.

## Luke 6:36

Show mercy, just as your Father shows mercy.

---

## Luke 6:37

“Refrain from judging, and you will not be judged. Refrain from condemning, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.

## Luke 6:38

Give, and it will be given to you. A generous measure, pressed down, shaken together, and overflowing, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.”

---

## Luke 6:39

He also shared this parable with them: “Can the blind lead the blind? Will they not both fall into a pit?

## Luke 6:40

The student is not above the teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will become like their teacher.

## Luke 6:41

Why do you look at the speck in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?

## Luke 6:42

How can you say to your brother, ‘Brother, let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when you yourself do not notice the plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.

## Luke 6:43

A healthy tree does not yield poor fruit, nor does a diseased tree yield good fruit.

## Luke 6:44

Each tree is recognised by its own fruit. People do not pick figs from thornbushes, nor do they gather grapes from briers.

## Luke 6:45

A good person brings good things out of the good stored up in their heart, and an evil person brings evil things out of the evil stored up in their heart. For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of.

---

## Luke 6:46

“Why do you address me as ‘Lord, Lord,’ and yet do not follow my instructions?

## Luke 6:47

Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice, I will show you what they are like:

## Luke 6:48

They are like a person building a house, who dug deep and laid the foundation on rock. When a flood came, the torrent struck that house but could not shake it, because it was well built.

## Luke 6:49

But the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a person who built a house on the ground without a foundation. The moment the torrent struck that house, it collapsed and its destruction was complete.”
