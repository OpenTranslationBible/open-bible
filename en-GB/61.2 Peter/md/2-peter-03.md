# 2 Peter Chapter 3

## 2 Peter 3:1

Beloved, this is now the second letter I am writing to you in which I am stirring up your sincere mind by way of reminder,

## 2 Peter 3:2

to remember the words spoken beforehand by the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Saviour spoken by your apostles.

## 2 Peter 3:3

Understand this first, that in the last days, scoffers will appear, following their own desires,

## 2 Peter 3:4

and questioning, “Where is the promise of His coming? Since the ancestors passed away, all things remain as they have been since the beginning of creation.”

## 2 Peter 3:5

For when they assert this, they overlook that by the word of God the heavens existed long ago and the earth was shaped out of water and by water,

## 2 Peter 3:6

through which the world of that time was destroyed when it was flooded with water.

## 2 Peter 3:7

But by His word the present heavens and earth are being reserved for fire, kept for the day of judgement and destruction of ungodly people.

## 2 Peter 3:8

However, do not forget this one truth, beloved: with the Lord, a single day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a single day.

## 2 Peter 3:9

The Lord is not delaying His promise, as some consider delay, but is patient with you, not wanting any to perish, but for all to come to repentance.

## 2 Peter 3:10

But the day of the Lord will arrive like a thief, when the heavens will vanish with a roar and the elements will be consumed by intense heat, and the earth and its works will be laid bare.

## 2 Peter 3:11

Since all these things are to be dissolved in this manner, what sort of people ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness,

## 2 Peter 3:12

anticipating and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be set ablaze and the elements will melt with intense heat!

## 2 Peter 3:13

But according to His promise, we are awaiting new heavens and a new earth, where righteousness resides.

## 2 Peter 3:14

Therefore, beloved, as you anticipate these things, be diligent to be found by Him spotless and blameless, at peace,

## 2 Peter 3:15

and consider the patience of our Lord as salvation; just as our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given to him, wrote to you,

## 2 Peter 3:16

as he does in all his letters, speaking in them of these matters, in which there are some things difficult to comprehend, which the unlearned and unstable twist, as they do the rest of the Scriptures, to their own ruin.

## 2 Peter 3:17

You therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, be on your guard so that you are not led astray by the error of unscrupulous people and fall from your own firm commitment,

## 2 Peter 3:18

but continue to grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.  
To Him be the glory, both now and forevermore. Amen.
