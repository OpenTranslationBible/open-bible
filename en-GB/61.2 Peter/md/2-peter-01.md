# 2 Peter Chapter 1

## 2 Peter 1:1

Simon Peter, a bond-servant and apostle of Jesus Christ,  
To those who have received a faith of the same kind as ours, by the righteousness of our God and Saviour, Jesus Christ:

## 2 Peter 1:2

Grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord,

## 2 Peter 1:3

for His divine power has provided us with everything necessary for life and godliness, through the true knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and excellence.

## 2 Peter 1:4

Through these, He has given us His precious and magnificent promises, so that by them you may become sharers in the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world because of desire.

## 2 Peter 1:5

Now for this very reason also, applying all diligence, in your faith add moral excellence, and in your moral excellence, knowledge,

## 2 Peter 1:6

and in your knowledge, develop self-control, and in your self-control, cultivate perseverance, and in your perseverance, nurture godliness,

## 2 Peter 1:7

and in your godliness, brotherly affection, and in your brotherly affection, love.

## 2 Peter 1:8

For if these qualities are yours and are growing, they will keep you from being ineffective or unproductive in the true knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.

## 2 Peter 1:9

For the one who lacks these qualities is blind or short-sighted, having forgotten the cleansing of their past sins.

## 2 Peter 1:10

Therefore, brothers and sisters, be all the more diligent to confirm His calling and choice of you; for as long as you practice these things, you will never stumble;

## 2 Peter 1:11

for in this way the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ will be richly provided to you.

## 2 Peter 1:12

Therefore, I will always be ready to remind you of these things, even though you already know them, and have been established in the truth that is present with you.

## 2 Peter 1:13

I consider it right, as long as I am in this earthly body, to stir you up by way of reminder,

## 2 Peter 1:14

knowing that the removal of my earthly body is imminent, as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me.

## 2 Peter 1:15

And I will also be diligent that at any time after my departure you will be able to recall these things.

## 2 Peter 1:16

For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of His majesty.

## 2 Peter 1:17

For when He received honour and glory from God the Father, such a declaration as this was made to Him by the Majestic Glory: “This is My beloved Son with whom I am well pleased”—

## 2 Peter 1:18

and we ourselves heard this voice from heaven when we were with Him on the holy mountain.

## 2 Peter 1:19

And so we have the prophetic word confirmed, to which you do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.

## 2 Peter 1:20

But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone’s own interpretation,

## 2 Peter 1:21

for no prophecy was ever made by human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.
