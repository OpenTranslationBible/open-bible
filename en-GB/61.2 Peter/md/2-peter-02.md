# 2 Peter Chapter 2

## 2 Peter 2:1

Yet false prophets emerged among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you, who will covertly bring in harmful teachings, even denying the Master who redeemed them, leading to their swift ruin.

## 2 Peter 2:2

Many will follow their indecent behaviour, and because of them the way of the truth will be maligned;

## 2 Peter 2:3

and in their greed they will exploit you with false words; their judgement from long ago is not idle, and their destruction is not asleep.

## 2 Peter 2:4

For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to pits of darkness, held for judgement;

## 2 Peter 2:5

and did not spare the ancient world, but safeguarded Noah, a preacher of righteousness, along with seven others, when He brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly;

## 2 Peter 2:6

and if He condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ruin by reducing them to ashes, making them an example of what is destined for the ungodly;

## 2 Peter 2:7

and if He rescued righteous Lot, who was distressed by the immoral conduct of unscrupulous people

## 2 Peter 2:8

(for by what he observed and heard, that righteous man, while living among them, felt his righteous soul tormented day after day by their lawless deeds),

## 2 Peter 2:9

then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from a trial, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgement,

## 2 Peter 2:10

and especially those who indulge the flesh in its corrupt passion, and despise authority. Reckless, self-centred, they speak abusively of angelic majesties without trembling,

## 2 Peter 2:11

whereas angels who are greater in might and power do not bring a reviling judgement against them before the Lord.

## 2 Peter 2:12

But these, like unreasoning animals, born as creatures of instinct to be captured and killed, speaking abusively in matters of which they are ignorant, will in the destruction of those creatures also be destroyed,

## 2 Peter 2:13

suffering harm as the wages of doing wrong. They count it a pleasure to revel in the daytime. They are stains and blemishes, delighting in their deceptions as they feast with you,

## 2 Peter 2:14

having eyes full of adultery that never cease from sinning, enticing unstable souls, with hearts trained in greed, accursed children;

## 2 Peter 2:15

forsaking the right way, they have wandered off, having followed the path of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved the reward of unrighteousness;

## 2 Peter 2:16

but he received a rebuke for his own offence, for a mute donkey, speaking with a human voice, restrained the madness of the prophet.

## 2 Peter 2:17

These are springs without water and mists driven by a storm, for whom the deepest darkness has been reserved.

## 2 Peter 2:18

For, while speaking out arrogant words of no value they entice by fleshly desires, by indecent behaviour, those who barely escape from the ones who live in error,

## 2 Peter 2:19

promising them freedom while they themselves are slaves of corruption; for by whatever overcomes a person, by this they are enslaved.

## 2 Peter 2:20

For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world by the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and are overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first.

## 2 Peter 2:21

For it would be preferable for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than having known it, to turn away from the holy commandment handed on to them.

## 2 Peter 2:22

This is shown by the true proverb:

> “A dog returns to its own vomit,”

and,

> “A sow, after washing, returns to wallowing in the mire.”
