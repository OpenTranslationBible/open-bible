# Song of Solomon Chapter 8

## Song of Solomon 8:1

If only you were like a brother to me,  
Who was nursed by my mother.  
If I found you outdoors, I would kiss you;  
No one would look down on me.

## Song of Solomon 8:2

I would lead you and bring you  
Into the house of my mother, who used to teach me;  
I would give you spiced wine to drink  
From the juice of my pomegranates.

## Song of Solomon 8:3

His left hand supports my head,  
And his right hand holds me close.

## Song of Solomon 8:4

I adjure you,  
O daughters of Jerusalem,  
Do not awaken or stir up love  
Until it pleases.

---

## Song of Solomon 8:5

Who is this coming up from the wilderness  
Leaning on her beloved?”

“Beneath the apple tree I awakened you;  
There your mother went into labour with you,  
There she was in labour and gave birth to you.

## Song of Solomon 8:6

Set me as a seal upon your heart,  
As a seal upon your arm.  
For love is as powerful as death,  
Passion as relentless as the grave;  
Its flashes are flashes of fire,  
A divine flame.

## Song of Solomon 8:7

Many waters cannot quench love,  
Nor will rivers flood it;  
If a man were to give all the riches of his house for love,  
It would be utterly despised.

## Song of Solomon 8:8

We have a little sister,  
And she has not yet matured;  
What shall we do for our sister  
On the day when she is spoken for?

## Song of Solomon 8:9

If she is a wall,  
We will build on her a silver battlement;  
But if she is a door,  
We will barricade her with planks of cedar.

---

## Song of Solomon 8:10

I was a wall, and my stature was like towers;  
Then I became in his eyes  
As one who finds peace.

## Song of Solomon 8:11

Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon;  
He leased the vineyard to caretakers.  
Each one was to bring a thousand shekels of silver for its fruit.

## Song of Solomon 8:12

My very own vineyard is at my disposal;  
The thousand shekels are for you, Solomon,  
And two hundred are for those who tend its fruit.

---

## Song of Solomon 8:13

You who dwell in the gardens,  
My companions are listening for your voice—  
Let me hear it!

## Song of Solomon 8:14

Hasten, my beloved,  
And be like a swift gazelle or a young stag  
Upon the fragrant hills.
