## Song of Solomon 1:2

May he kiss me with the kisses of his mouth!  
For your love is better than wine.

## Song of Solomon 1:3

Your oils have a pleasing fragrance,  
Your name is like purified oil;  
Therefore the young women love you.

## Song of Solomon 1:4

Draw me after you and let us run together!  
The king has brought me into his chambers.

We will rejoice and be glad in you;  
We will praise your love more than wine.  
Rightly do they love you.

## Song of Solomon 1:5

I am black and beautiful,  
You daughters of Jerusalem,  
Like the tents of Kedar,  
Like the curtains of Solomon.

## Song of Solomon 1:6

Do not stare at me because I am dark,  
For the sun has tanned me.  
My motherâ€™s sons were angry with me;  
They made me caretaker of the vineyards,  
But I have not taken care of my own vineyard.

## Song of Solomon 1:7

Tell me, you whom my soul loves,  
Where do you pasture your flock,  
Where do you have it lie down at noon?  
For why should I be like one who veils herself  
Beside the flocks of your companions?

## Song of Solomon 1:8

If you yourself do not know,  
Most beautiful among women,  
Go out on the trail of the flock  
And pasture your young goats  
By the tents of the shepherds.

## Song of Solomon 1:9

To me, my darling, you are like  
My mare among the chariots of Pharaoh.

## Song of Solomon 1:10

Your cheeks are delightful with jewellery,  
Your neck with strings of beads.

## Song of Solomon 1:11

We will make for you jewellery of gold  
With beads of silver.

## Song of Solomon 1:12

While the king was at his table,  
My perfume gave forth its fragrance.

## Song of Solomon 1:13

My beloved is to me a pouch of myrrh  
Which lies all night between my breasts.

## Song of Solomon 1:14

My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms  
In the vineyards of Engedi.

## Song of Solomon 1:15

How beautiful you are, my darling,  
How beautiful you are!  
Your eyes are like doves.

## Song of Solomon 1:16

How handsome you are, my beloved,  
And so delightful!  
Indeed, our couch is luxuriant!

## Song of Solomon 1:17

The beams of our houses are cedars,  
Our rafters, cypresses.
