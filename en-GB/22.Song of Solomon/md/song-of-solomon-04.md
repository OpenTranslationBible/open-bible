# Song of Solomon Chapter 4

## Song of Solomon 4:1

How beautiful you are, my darling,  
How beautiful you are!  
Your eyes are like doves behind your veil;  
Your hair is like a flock of goats  
That have descended from Mount Gilead.

## Song of Solomon 4:2

Your teeth are like a flock of newly shorn sheep  
Which have come up from their washing,  
All of which bear twins,  
And not one among them has lost her young.

## Song of Solomon 4:3

Your lips are like a scarlet thread,  
And your mouth is beautiful.  
Your temples are like a slice of a pomegranate  
Behind your veil.

## Song of Solomon 4:4

Your neck is like the tower of David,  
Built with layers of stones  
On which are hung a thousand shields,  
All the round shields of the warriors.

## Song of Solomon 4:5

Your two breasts are like two fawns,  
Twins of a gazelle,  
That graze among the lilies.

## Song of Solomon 4:6

Until the cool of the day,  
When the shadows flee,  
I will go my way to the mountain of myrrh  
And to the hill of frankincense.

## Song of Solomon 4:7

You are altogether beautiful, my darling,  
And there is no blemish in you.

## Song of Solomon 4:8

Come with me from Lebanon, my bride,  
May you come with me from Lebanon.  
Journey down from the summit of Amana,  
From the summit of Senir and Hermon,  
From the dens of lions,  
From the mountains of leopards.

## Song of Solomon 4:9

You have enchanted my heart, my sister, my bride;  
You have enchanted my heart with a single glance of your eyes,  
With a single strand of your necklace.

## Song of Solomon 4:10

How delightful is your love, my sister, my bride!  
How much better is your love than wine,  
And the fragrance of your oils than all kinds of balsam oils!

## Song of Solomon 4:11

Your lips drip honey, my bride;  
Honey and milk are under your tongue,  
And the fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon.

## Song of Solomon 4:12

A locked garden is my sister, my bride,  
A locked well, a sealed spring.

## Song of Solomon 4:13

Your branches are an orchard of pomegranates  
With delicious fruits,  
Henna with nard plants,

## Song of Solomon 4:14

Nard and saffron, spice cane and cinnamon,  
With all the trees of frankincense,  
Myrrh and aloes, along with all the finest balsam oils.

## Song of Solomon 4:15

You are a garden spring,  
A well of fresh water,  
And flowing streams from Lebanon.

---

## Song of Solomon 4:16

Awake, north wind,  
And come, wind of the south;  
Make my garden breathe out fragrance,  
Let its balsam oils flow.  
May my beloved come into his garden  
And eat its delightful fruits!
