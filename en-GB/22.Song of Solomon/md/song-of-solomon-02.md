# Song of Solomon Chapter 2

## Song of Solomon 2:1

I am the rose of Sharon,  
The lily of the valleys.

## Song of Solomon 2:2

Like a lily among the thorns,  
So is my darling among the young women.

---

## Song of Solomon 2:3

Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest,  
So is my beloved among the young men.  
In his shade I took great delight and sat down,  
And his fruit was sweet to my taste.

## Song of Solomon 2:4

He has brought me to his banquet hall,  
And his banner over me is love.

## Song of Solomon 2:5

Refresh me with raisin cakes,  
Sustain me with apples,  
Because I am lovesick.

## Song of Solomon 2:6

His left hand is under my head,  
And his right hand embraces me.

---

## Song of Solomon 2:7

I adjure you,  
O daughters of Jerusalem,  
By the gazelles or by the does of the field,  
That you do not awaken or stir up love  
Until it pleases.

## Song of Solomon 2:8

The voice of my beloved!  
Behold, he is coming,  
Leaping on the mountains,  
Skipping on the hills!

## Song of Solomon 2:9

My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag.  
Behold, he is standing behind our wall,  
He is looking through the windows,  
He is peering through the lattice.

---

## Song of Solomon 2:10

My beloved responded and said to me,  
“Arise, my darling, my beautiful one,  
And come along.

## Song of Solomon 2:11

For behold, the winter is past,  
The rain is over and gone.

## Song of Solomon 2:12

The blossoms have appeared in the land;  
The time has arrived for pruning the vines,  
And the voice of the turtledove has been heard in our land.

## Song of Solomon 2:13

The fig tree has ripened its fruit,  
And the vines in blossom have given forth fragrance.  
Arise, my darling, my beautiful one,  
And come along!”

---

## Song of Solomon 2:14

My dove, in the clefts of the rock,  
In the hiding place of the mountain pathway,  
Let me see your form,  
Let me hear your voice;  
For your voice is sweet,  
And your form is lovely.

## Song of Solomon 2:15

Catch the foxes for us,  
The little foxes that are ruining the vineyards,  
While our vineyards are in blossom.

---

## Song of Solomon 2:16

My beloved is mine, and I am his;  
He pastures his flock among the lilies.

## Song of Solomon 2:17

Until the cool of the day when the shadows flee,  
Turn, my beloved, and be like a gazelle  
Or a young stag on the mountains of Bether.
