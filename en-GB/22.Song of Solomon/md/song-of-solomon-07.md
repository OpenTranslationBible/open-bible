# Song of Solomon Chapter 7

## Song of Solomon 7:1

How beautiful are your feet in sandals,  
O daughter of a prince!  
The curves of your hips are like jewels,  
The work of the hands of an artist.

## Song of Solomon 7:2

Your navel is a round goblet  
That never lacks mixed wine;  
Your belly is like a heap of wheat  
Fenced about with lilies.

## Song of Solomon 7:3

Your two breasts are like gentle fawns,  
Twins of a gazelle.

## Song of Solomon 7:4

Your neck is graceful like a tower of ivory,  
Your eyes are like the serene pools in Heshbon  
By the gate of Bath-rabbim;  
Your nose is as elegant as the tower of Lebanon,  
Which looks toward Damascus.

## Song of Solomon 7:5

Your head is majestic like Carmel,  
And the flowing hair of your head resembles purple threads;  
The king is enchanted by your tresses.

## Song of Solomon 7:6

How lovely and how pleasing you are,  
My love, with all your charms!

## Song of Solomon 7:7

Your stature is like a palm tree,  
And your breasts resemble its clusters.

## Song of Solomon 7:8

I said, “I will climb the palm tree,  
I will take hold of its fruit stalks.”  
Oh, may your breasts be like clusters of the vine,  
And the fragrance of your breath be like apples,

## Song of Solomon 7:9

And your mouth like the finest wine!”

It glides smoothly for my beloved,  
Flowing gently through the lips of those who rest.

## Song of Solomon 7:10

I belong to my beloved,  
And his longing is for me.

## Song of Solomon 7:11

Come, my beloved, let us venture into the countryside,  
Let us spend the night in the villages.

## Song of Solomon 7:12

Let us rise early and go to the vineyards;  
Let us see whether the vine has budded  
And its blossoms have opened,  
And whether the pomegranates have bloomed.  
There I will share my love with you.

## Song of Solomon 7:13

The mandrakes have released their fragrance;  
And over our doors are all the choice fruits,  
Both new and old,  
Which I have kept for you, my beloved.
