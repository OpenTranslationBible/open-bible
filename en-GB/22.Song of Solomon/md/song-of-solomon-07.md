# Song of Solomon Chapter 7

## Song of Solomon 7:1

How beautiful are your feet in sandals,  
O daughter of a prince!  
The curves of your hips are like jewels,  
The work of the hands of an artist.

## Song of Solomon 7:2

Your navel is a round goblet  
That never lacks mixed wine;  
Your belly is like a heap of wheat  
Fenced about with lilies.

## Song of Solomon 7:3

Your two breasts are like two fawns,  
Twins of a gazelle.

## Song of Solomon 7:4

Your neck is like a tower of ivory,  
Your eyes like the pools in Heshbon  
By the gate of Bath-rabbim;  
Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon,  
Which faces toward Damascus.

## Song of Solomon 7:5

Your head crowns you like Carmel,  
And the flowing hair of your head is like purple threads;  
The king is captivated by your tresses.

## Song of Solomon 7:6

How beautiful and how delightful you are,  
My love, with all your delights!

## Song of Solomon 7:7

Your stature is like a palm tree,  
And your breasts are like its clusters.

## Song of Solomon 7:8

I said, “I will climb the palm tree,  
I will take hold of its fruit stalks.”  
Oh, may your breasts be like clusters of the vine,  
And the fragrance of your breath like apples,

## Song of Solomon 7:9

And your mouth like the best wine!”

It goes down smoothly for my beloved,  
Flowing gently through the lips of those who fall asleep.

## Song of Solomon 7:10

I am my beloved’s,  
And his desire is for me.

## Song of Solomon 7:11

Come, my beloved, let us go out into the country,  
Let us spend the night in the villages.

## Song of Solomon 7:12

Let us rise early and go to the vineyards;  
Let us see whether the vine has budded  
And its blossoms have opened,  
And whether the pomegranates have bloomed.  
There I will give you my love.

## Song of Solomon 7:13

The mandrakes have given forth fragrance;  
And over our doors are all the choice fruits,  
Both new and old,  
Which I have saved for you, my beloved.
