# Song of Solomon Chapter 3

## Song of Solomon 3:1

Upon my bed, night after night, I searched for him  
Whom my soul cherishes;  
I sought him but did not find him.

## Song of Solomon 3:2

I must arise now and go about the city;  
In the streets and in the public squares.  
I must seek him whom my soul cherishes.”  
I searched for him but did not find him.

## Song of Solomon 3:3

The watchmen who patrol the city found me,  
And I asked,  
“Have you seen him whom my soul cherishes?”

## Song of Solomon 3:4

Scarcely had I passed them  
When I found him whom my soul cherishes;  
I held on to him and would not let him go  
Until I had brought him to my mother’s house,  
And into the room of her who conceived me.

## Song of Solomon 3:5

I adjure you,  
O daughters of Jerusalem,  
By the gazelles or by the does of the field,  
That you do not awaken or stir up love  
Until it pleases.

## Song of Solomon 3:6

What is this coming up from the wilderness  
Like columns of smoke,  
Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense,  
With all the scented powders of the merchant?

## Song of Solomon 3:7

Behold, it is the travelling couch of Solomon;  
Sixty warriors around it,  
Of the warriors of Israel.

## Song of Solomon 3:8

All of them are wielders of the sword,  
Expert in war;  
Each has his sword at his side,  
Guarding against the terrors of the night.

## Song of Solomon 3:9

King Solomon made for himself a sedan chair  
From the timber of Lebanon.

## Song of Solomon 3:10

He crafted its posts of silver,  
Its back of gold,  
And its seat of purple fabric,  
With its interior lovingly adorned  
By the daughters of Jerusalem.

## Song of Solomon 3:11

Go out, you daughters of Zion,  
And behold King Solomon with the crown  
With which his mother crowned him  
On the day of his wedding,  
And on the day of his heart’s delight.
