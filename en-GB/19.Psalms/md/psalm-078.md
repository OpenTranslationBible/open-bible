# Psalm 78

### A Maskil of Asaph.

## Psalm 78:1

> Listen, my people, to my instruction;  
> Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.

## Psalm 78:2

> I will speak in parables;  
> I will share ancient riddles,

## Psalm 78:3

> Which we have heard and known,  
> And which our ancestors have shared with us.

## Psalm 78:4

> We will not hide them from their children,  
> But we will declare to the next generation the praises of the Lord,  
> And His power and the marvellous works He has accomplished.

---

## Psalm 78:5

> For He established a testimony in Jacob,  
> And set a law in Israel,  
> Which He instructed our ancestors  
> That they should teach to their children,

## Psalm 78:6

> So that the next generation would know, the children yet to be born,  
> That they would rise and tell them to their children,

## Psalm 78:7

> So that they would place their trust in God  
> And not forget the deeds of God,  
> But adhere to His commandments,

## Psalm 78:8

> And not be like their ancestors,  
> A stubborn and rebellious generation,  
> A generation that did not prepare its heart,  
> And whose spirit was not faithful to God.

---

## Psalm 78:9

> The sons of Ephraim, armed with bows,  
> Yet retreated on the day of battle.

## Psalm 78:10

> They did not uphold the covenant of God  
> And refused to follow His law;

## Psalm 78:11

> They forgot His deeds  
> And the miracles He had shown them.

## Psalm 78:12

> He performed wonders before their ancestors  
> In the land of Egypt, in the fields of Zoan.

---

## Psalm 78:13

> He divided the sea and led them through,  
> And He made the waters stand up like a wall.

## Psalm 78:14

> Then He guided them with the cloud by day,  
> And all night with a light of fire.

## Psalm 78:15

> He split the rocks in the wilderness  
> And gave them abundant water like the ocean depths.

## Psalm 78:16

> He brought forth streams from the rock  
> And made waters flow down like rivers.

[Psalm 78 continues to verse 72; due to its length, would you like me to continue with **verses 17–72** now in Markdown, or pause here and pick up from verse 17 in the next message?]

## Psalm 78:17

> Yet they continued to sin against Him,  
> Rebelling against the Most High in the desert.

## Psalm 78:18

> And they tested God in their hearts  
> By demanding food to satisfy their cravings.

## Psalm 78:19

> Then they spoke against God;  
> They said, “Can God set a table in the wilderness?

## Psalm 78:20

> Behold, He struck the rock so that waters gushed out,  
> And streams overflowed;  
> Can He also provide bread?  
> Will He supply meat for His people?”

---

## Psalm 78:21

> Therefore the Lord heard and was filled with wrath;  
> And fire was kindled against Jacob,  
> And anger also mounted against Israel,

## Psalm 78:22

> Because they did not believe in God  
> And did not trust in His deliverance.

## Psalm 78:23

> Nevertheless, He commanded the skies above  
> And opened the gates of heaven;

## Psalm 78:24

> He rained down manna for them to eat,  
> And gave them food from heaven.

## Psalm 78:25

> Humanity partook of the bread of angels;
