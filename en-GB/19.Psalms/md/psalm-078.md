# Psalm 78

### A Maskil of Asaph.

## Psalm 78:1

> Listen, my people, to my instruction;  
> Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.

## Psalm 78:2

> I will open my mouth in a parable;  
> I will tell riddles of old,

## Psalm 78:3

> Which we have heard and known,  
> And our fathers have told us.

## Psalm 78:4

> We will not conceal them from their children,  
> But we will tell the generation to come the praises of the Lord,  
> And His power and His wondrous works that He has done.

---

## Psalm 78:5

> For He established a testimony in Jacob,  
> And appointed a law in Israel,  
> Which He commanded our fathers  
> That they were to teach them to their children,

## Psalm 78:6

> So that the generation to come would know, the children yet to be born,  
> That they would arise and tell them to their children,

## Psalm 78:7

> So that they would put their confidence in God  
> And not forget the works of God,  
> But comply with His commandments,

## Psalm 78:8

> And not be like their fathers,  
> A stubborn and rebellious generation,  
> A generation that did not prepare its heart,  
> And whose spirit was not faithful to God.

---

## Psalm 78:9

> The sons of Ephraim were archers equipped with bows,  
> Yet they turned back on the day of battle.

## Psalm 78:10

> They did not keep the covenant of God  
> And refused to walk in His Law;

## Psalm 78:11

> They forgot His deeds  
> And His miracles that He had shown them.

## Psalm 78:12

> He performed wonders before their fathers  
> In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.

---

## Psalm 78:13

> He divided the sea and caused them to pass through,  
> And He made the waters stand up like a heap.

## Psalm 78:14

> Then He led them with the cloud by day,  
> And all the night with a light of fire.

## Psalm 78:15

> He split the rocks in the wilderness  
> And gave them plenty to drink like the ocean depths.

## Psalm 78:16

> He brought forth streams from the rock  
> And made waters run down like rivers.
