# Hebrews Chapter 10

## Hebrews 10:1

For the law, having only a shadow of the good things to come and not the actual form of those things, can never, by the same sacrifices offered continually year after year, make perfect those who approach to worship.

## Hebrews 10:2

Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered? For the worshippers, having been cleansed once for all, would no longer have a consciousness of sins.

## Hebrews 10:3

But in those sacrifices there is a yearly reminder of sins.

## Hebrews 10:4

For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.

## Hebrews 10:5

Therefore, when Christ came into the world, he said:

> “Sacrifice and offering you did not desire,
> but a body you prepared for me;

## Hebrews 10:6

with burnt offerings and sin offerings you found no delight.

## Hebrews 10:7

> Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come
> — it is written about me in the scroll of the book
> — to do your will, O God.’”

## Hebrews 10:8

After saying above, “Sacrifices and offerings, burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not desire, nor were you pleased with them”—though they were offered according to the law—

## Hebrews 10:9

then he said, “Behold, I have come to do your will.” He takes away the first to establish the second.

## Hebrews 10:10

And by that will, we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.

## Hebrews 10:11

Day after day every priest stands and performs his religious duties; repeatedly he offers the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.

## Hebrews 10:12

But this priest, having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, sat down at the right hand of God,

## Hebrews 10:13

awaiting the time when his enemies are made a footstool for his feet.

## Hebrews 10:14

For with one offering he has perfected forever those who are being sanctified.

## Hebrews 10:15

The Holy Spirit also bears witness to us regarding this. First he says:

## Hebrews 10:16

> “This is the covenant I will make with them
> after those days, declares the Lord.
> I will put my laws in their hearts,
> and I will write them on their minds.”

## Hebrews 10:17

Then he adds:

> “Their sins and lawless acts
> I will remember no more.”

## Hebrews 10:18

Now where there is forgiveness of these, an offering for sin is no longer necessary.

## Hebrews 10:19

Therefore, dear friends, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus,

## Hebrews 10:20

by a new and living way opened for us through the veil, that is, his flesh,

## Hebrews 10:21

and since we have a great priest over the house of God,

## Hebrews 10:22

let us draw near to God with a sincere heart and with the full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.

## Hebrews 10:23

Let us hold firmly to the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful.

## Hebrews 10:24

And let us consider how to spur one another on towards love and good deeds,

## Hebrews 10:25

not neglecting to meet together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching.

## Hebrews 10:26

For if we deliberately continue sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,

## Hebrews 10:27

but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of a raging fire that will consume the adversaries.

## Hebrews 10:28

Anyone who disregarded the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.

## Hebrews 10:29

How much more severely do you think someone deserves to be punished who has trampled the Son of God underfoot, regarded as unholy the blood of the covenant that sanctified them, and insulted the Spirit of grace?

## Hebrews 10:30

For we know him who said, “Vengeance is mine; I will repay,” and again, “The Lord will judge his people.”

## Hebrews 10:31

It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.

## Hebrews 10:32

But remember those earlier days after you had been enlightened, when you endured a great conflict full of sufferings.

## Hebrews 10:33

Sometimes you were made a public spectacle through insults and persecution; at other times you stood side by side with those who were so treated.

## Hebrews 10:34

You sympathised with those in prison and joyfully accepted the confiscation of your property, knowing that you have for yourselves a better and lasting possession.

## Hebrews 10:35

Therefore, do not throw away your confidence, which will be richly rewarded.

## Hebrews 10:36

For you need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you may receive what he has promised.

## Hebrews 10:37

For in a very short time, the one who is coming will arrive and will not delay.

## Hebrews 10:38

But my righteous one will live by faith. And I take no pleasure in the one who shrinks back.

## Hebrews 10:39

But we are not among those who shrink back and are destroyed, but among those who have faith and preserve their souls.
