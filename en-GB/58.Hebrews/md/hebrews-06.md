# Hebrews Chapter 6

## Hebrews 6:1
Therefore, leaving behind the elementary teachings about Christ, let us advance towards maturity, not laying again the foundation of repentance from deeds that lead to death, and of faith towards God,

## Hebrews 6:2
instruction about ceremonial washings, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgement.

## Hebrews 6:3
And this we will do, if God allows.

## Hebrews 6:4
For it is impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit,

## Hebrews 6:5
and have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come,

## Hebrews 6:6
and then have fallen away, to be restored again to repentance, since they are crucifying the Son of God all over again and subjecting Him to public disgrace.

## Hebrews 6:7
For land that drinks in the rain often falling on it and produces vegetation useful to those for whom it is cultivated receives a blessing from God;

## Hebrews 6:8
but if it bears thorns and thistles, it is worthless and near to being cursed, and in the end it is burned.

## Hebrews 6:9
But, beloved, we are convinced of better things concerning you, things that accompany salvation, even though we speak in this manner.

## Hebrews 6:10
For God is not unjust; He will not forget your work and the love you have shown towards His name, having served and continuing to serve the saints.

## Hebrews 6:11
And we desire that each of you show the same diligence to realise the full assurance of hope until the end,

## Hebrews 6:12
so that you will not become sluggish, but imitate those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.

## Hebrews 6:13
When God made His promise to Abraham, since He could swear by no one greater, He swore by Himself,

## Hebrews 6:14
saying, “Surely I will bless you and multiply you greatly.”

## Hebrews 6:15
Thus, after Abraham had patiently endured, he received what was promised.

## Hebrews 6:16
People swear by someone greater than themselves, and the oath serves as confirmation to end all disputes.

## Hebrews 6:17
In the same way, God, wanting to make the unchanging nature of His purpose very clear to the heirs of the promise, confirmed it with an oath,

## Hebrews 6:18
so that by two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to hold firmly to the hope set before us.

## Hebrews 6:19
We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure, and it enters the inner sanctuary behind the veil,

## Hebrews 6:20
where Jesus has entered as a forerunner for us, having become a high priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.
