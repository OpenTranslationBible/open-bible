# Hebrews Chapter 5

## Hebrews 5:1

Every high priest is chosen from among men and is appointed to act on behalf of people in matters relating to God, to offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins.

## Hebrews 5:2

He can deal gently with those who are ignorant and going astray, since he himself is also subject to weakness.

## Hebrews 5:3

Because of this, he is required to offer sacrifices for his own sins, as well as for the sins of the people.

## Hebrews 5:4

And no one assumes this honour for himself, but he receives it when called by God, just as Aaron was.

## Hebrews 5:5

Similarly, Christ did not glorify Himself by becoming a high priest, but it was God who said to Him,

> “You are My Son;
> today I have begotten You.”

## Hebrews 5:6

And He says in another place,

> “You are a priest forever,
> according to the order of Melchizedek.”

## Hebrews 5:7

During the days of His earthly life, He offered up prayers and petitions with loud cries and tears to the One who could save Him from death, and He was heard because of His reverent submission.

## Hebrews 5:8

Although He was a Son, He learned obedience through what He suffered.

## Hebrews 5:9

And having been made perfect, He became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey Him,

## Hebrews 5:10

being designated by God as a high priest in the order of Melchizedek.

## Hebrews 5:11

We have much to say about this, but it is hard to explain, since you have become slow to understand.

## Hebrews 5:12

For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the basic principles of God’s word. You need milk, not solid food!

## Hebrews 5:13

For anyone who lives on milk is unacquainted with the teaching about righteousness, for he is still an infant.

## Hebrews 5:14

But solid food is for the mature, who through constant practice have trained themselves to discern good from evil.
