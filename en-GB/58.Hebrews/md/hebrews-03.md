# Hebrews Chapter 3

## Hebrews 3:1

Therefore, holy brothers and sisters, participants in the heavenly calling, focus your thoughts on Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest of our confession.

## Hebrews 3:2

He was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses was faithful in all his house.

## Hebrews 3:3

For Jesus has been deemed worthy of greater glory than Moses, just as the builder of a house has more honour than the house itself.

## Hebrews 3:4

For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.

## Hebrews 3:5

Moses was faithful as a servant in all God's house, bearing witness to what would be spoken later.

## Hebrews 3:6

But Christ is faithful as a Son over God's house. And we are his house, if indeed we hold firmly to our confidence and the hope in which we boast.

## Hebrews 3:7

Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says:

> “Today, if you hear his voice,

## Hebrews 3:8

> do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion,
> during the day of testing in the wilderness,

## Hebrews 3:9

where your ancestors tested and tried me, and saw my works for forty years.

## Hebrews 3:10

> Therefore I was angry with that generation,
> and said, ‘Their hearts always go astray,
> and they have not known my ways.’

## Hebrews 3:11

> So I swore in my anger,
> ‘They shall never enter my rest.’”

## Hebrews 3:12

See to it, brothers and sisters, that none of you has an evil, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God.

## Hebrews 3:13

But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called “Today,” so that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.

## Hebrews 3:14

For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold our original conviction firmly to the end.

## Hebrews 3:15

As it has been said:

> “Today, if you hear his voice,
> do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.”

## Hebrews 3:16

Who were they who heard and rebelled? Were they not all those led out of Egypt by Moses?

## Hebrews 3:17

And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?

## Hebrews 3:18

And to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest, if not to those who were disobedient?

## Hebrews 3:19

So we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief.
