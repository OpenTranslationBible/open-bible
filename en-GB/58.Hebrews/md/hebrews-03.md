# Hebrews Chapter 3

## Hebrews 3:1

Therefore, holy brothers and sisters, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession: Jesus;

## Hebrews 3:2

He was faithful to Him who appointed Him, as Moses also was in all His house.

## Hebrews 3:3

For He has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by just so much as the builder of the house has more honour than the house.

## Hebrews 3:4

For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.

## Hebrews 3:5

Now Moses was faithful in all His house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken later;

## Hebrews 3:6

but Christ was faithful as a Son over His house—whose house we are, if we hold firmly to our confidence and the boast of our hope.

## Hebrews 3:7

Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit says,

> “Today if you hear His voice,

## Hebrews 3:8

> Do not harden your hearts as when they provoked Me,  
> As on the day of trial in the wilderness,

## Hebrews 3:9

> Where your fathers put Me to the test,  
> And saw My works for forty years.

## Hebrews 3:10

> Therefore I was angry with that generation,  
> And said, ‘They always go astray in their heart,  
> And they did not know My ways’;

## Hebrews 3:11

> As I swore in My anger,  
> ‘They certainly shall not enter My rest.’”

## Hebrews 3:12

Take care, brothers and sisters, that there will not be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving heart that falls away from the living God.

## Hebrews 3:13

But encourage one another every day, as long as it is still called “today,” so that none of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.

## Hebrews 3:14

For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold firmly the beginning of our assurance until the end,

## Hebrews 3:15

while it is said,

> “Today if you hear His voice,  
> Do not harden your hearts, as when they provoked Me.”

## Hebrews 3:16

For who provoked Him when they had heard? Indeed, did not all those who came out of Egypt led by Moses?

## Hebrews 3:17

And with whom was He angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose dead bodies fell in the wilderness?

## Hebrews 3:18

And to whom did He swear that they would not enter His rest, but to those who were disobedient?

## Hebrews 3:19

So we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief.
