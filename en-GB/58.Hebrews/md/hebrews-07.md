# Hebrews Chapter 7

## Hebrews 7:1

This Melchizedek, king of Salem and priest of the Most High God, met Abraham as he returned from the defeat of the kings and blessed him.

## Hebrews 7:2

Abraham gave him a tenth of everything. First, by the translation of his name, he is king of righteousness; and then also king of Salem, which means king of peace.

## Hebrews 7:3

Without father or mother, without genealogy, without beginning of days or end of life, but made like the Son of God, he remains a priest perpetually.

## Hebrews 7:4

Consider how great he was: Even the patriarch Abraham gave him a tenth of the choicest spoils.

## Hebrews 7:5

The descendants of Levi who receive the priesthood have a commandment in the Law to collect a tenth from the people, that is, from their fellow Israelites, even though they too are descended from Abraham.

## Hebrews 7:6

Yet this man, whose genealogy is not traced from them, collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises.

## Hebrews 7:7

Without any dispute, the lesser is blessed by the greater.

## Hebrews 7:8

In this instance, mortal men receive tithes, but in that instance, one receives them, of whom it is testified that he continues to live.

## Hebrews 7:9

So to speak, through Abraham even Levi, who receives tithes, has paid tithes,

## Hebrews 7:10

for he was not yet born, not yet produced of his ancestors when Melchizedek met him.

## Hebrews 7:11

If perfection could have been achieved through the Levitical priesthood (for on the basis of it the people received the Law), why was there still need for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not be designated according to the order of Aaron?

## Hebrews 7:12

For when the priesthood is changed, there must also be a change of the law.

## Hebrews 7:13

For the one about whom these things are said belonged to a different tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar.

## Hebrews 7:14

It is evident that our Lord descended from Judah, a tribe with reference to which Moses said nothing concerning priests.

## Hebrews 7:15

And this becomes even more evident if another priest arises according to the likeness of Melchizedek,

## Hebrews 7:16

who has become a priest not on the basis of a regulation as to his ancestry, but according to the power of an indestructible life.

## Hebrews 7:17

For it is declared about Him:

> “You are a priest forever,
> in the order of Melchizedek.”

## Hebrews 7:18

The previous regulation is set aside because it was weak and ineffective.

## Hebrews 7:19

(for the Law made nothing perfect), and a better hope is introduced, through which we draw near to God.

## Hebrews 7:20

And it was indeed accompanied by an oath!

## Hebrews 7:21

For others became priests without any oath, but He became a priest with an oath when God said to Him:

> “The Lord has sworn
> and will not change His mind:
> ‘You are a priest forever.’”

## Hebrews 7:22

Because of this oath, Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant.

## Hebrews 7:23

There have been many of those priests, since death prevented them from continuing in office;

## Hebrews 7:24

but because Jesus lives forever, He holds His priesthood permanently.

## Hebrews 7:25

Therefore, He is able to save fully those who come to God through Him, because He always lives to intercede for them.

## Hebrews 7:26

For it was fitting for us to have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, set apart from sinners, and exalted above the heavens.

## Hebrews 7:27

Unlike the other high priests, He does not need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for His own sins, and then for the sins of the people. He offered the sacrifice for their sins once for all when He gave Himself.

## Hebrews 7:28

For the Law appoints as high priests men who are weak; but the word of the oath, which came after the Law, appoints the Son, who has been made perfect forever.
