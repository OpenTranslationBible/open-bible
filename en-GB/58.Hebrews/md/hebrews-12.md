# Hebrews Chapter 12

## Hebrews 12:1

Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us rid ourselves of every hindrance and the sin that so easily ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race set before us,

## Hebrews 12:2

fixing our eyes on Jesus, the originator and perfecter of our faith. For the joy set before him, he endured the cross, despising its shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.

## Hebrews 12:3

Consider him who endured such hostility from sinners, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.

## Hebrews 12:4

In your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood.

## Hebrews 12:5

And have you forgotten the exhortation which addresses you as sons?

> It says, “My son, do not take lightly the Lord’s discipline,
> and do not lose heart when he rebukes you,

## Hebrews 12:6

> because the Lord disciplines the one he loves,
> and he chastens every son he accepts.”

## Hebrews 12:7

Endure hardship as discipline; God is dealing with you as with children. For what child is there whom a father does not discipline?

## Hebrews 12:8

If you are without discipline, of which everyone partakes, then you are illegitimate and not true sons and daughters.

## Hebrews 12:9

Moreover, we have all had earthly fathers who disciplined us and we respected them. How much more should we submit to the Father of spirits and live!

## Hebrews 12:10

They disciplined us for a short time as they thought best; but God disciplines us for our good, that we may share in his holiness.

## Hebrews 12:11

No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Yet later on, it yields a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it.

## Hebrews 12:12

Therefore, strengthen your weak hands and feeble knees.

## Hebrews 12:13

Make straight paths for your feet, so that the lame may not be disabled, but rather healed.

## Hebrews 12:14

Pursue peace with everyone, and holiness, without which no one will see the Lord.

## Hebrews 12:15

See to it that no one falls short of the grace of God, and that no root of bitterness springs up to cause trouble and defile many.

## Hebrews 12:16

See that no one is sexually immoral or godless like Esau, who for a single meal sold his inheritance rights as the eldest son.

## Hebrews 12:17

Afterwards, as you know, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected. He found no place for repentance, though he sought it with tears.

## Hebrews 12:18

For you have not come to a mountain that can be touched, and to a blazing fire, and to darkness, gloom, and storm;

## Hebrews 12:19

to a trumpet blast or to a voice speaking words that those who heard it begged that no further word be spoken to them,

## Hebrews 12:20

because they could not bear the command: “If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned.”

## Hebrews 12:21

The sight was so terrifying that Moses said, “I am trembling with fear.”

## Hebrews 12:22

But you have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels in joyful assembly,

## Hebrews 12:23

to the general assembly and church of the firstborn, whose names are written in heaven. You have come to God, the Judge of all, to the spirits of the righteous made perfect,

## Hebrews 12:24

to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.

## Hebrews 12:25

See to it that you do not refuse him who speaks. For if they did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, how much less will we escape if we turn away from him who warns us from heaven?

## Hebrews 12:26

At that time his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, “Once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heavens.”

## Hebrews 12:27

The phrase “once more” indicates the removal of what can be shaken—that is, created things—so that what cannot be shaken may remain.

## Hebrews 12:28

Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful, and so worship God acceptably with reverence and awe,

## Hebrews 12:29

for our God is a consuming fire.
