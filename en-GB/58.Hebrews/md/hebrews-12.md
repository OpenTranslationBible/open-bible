# Hebrews Chapter 12

## Hebrews 12:1

Therefore, since we also have such a great cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us rid ourselves of every obstacle and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,

## Hebrews 12:2

looking only at Jesus, the originator and perfecter of the faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.

## Hebrews 12:3

For consider Him who has endured such hostility by sinners against Himself, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.

## Hebrews 12:4

You have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood in your striving against sin;

## Hebrews 12:5

and you have forgotten the exhortation which is addressed to you as sons,

> “My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord,  
> Nor faint when you are punished by Him;

## Hebrews 12:6

> For whom the Lord loves He disciplines,  
> And He punishes every son whom He accepts.”

## Hebrews 12:7

It is for discipline that you endure; God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline?

## Hebrews 12:8

But if you are without discipline, of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate children and not sons.

## Hebrews 12:9

Furthermore, we had earthly fathers to discipline us, and we respected them; shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits, and live?

## Hebrews 12:10

For they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them, but He disciplines us for our good, so that we may share His holiness.

## Hebrews 12:11

For the moment, all discipline seems not to be pleasant, but painful; yet to those who have been trained by it, afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness.

## Hebrews 12:12

Therefore, strengthen the hands that are weak and the knees that are feeble,

## Hebrews 12:13

and make straight paths for your feet, so that the limb which is impaired may not be dislocated, but rather be healed.

## Hebrews 12:14

Pursue peace with all people, and the holiness without which no one will see the Lord.

## Hebrews 12:15

See to it that no one falls short of the grace of God; that no root of bitterness springing up causes trouble, and by it many become defiled;

## Hebrews 12:16

that there be no sexually immoral or godless person like Esau, who sold his own birthright for a single meal.

## Hebrews 12:17

For you know that even afterward, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for repentance, though he sought for it with tears.

## Hebrews 12:18

For you have not come to a mountain that can be touched and to a blazing fire, and to darkness, gloom, and whirlwind,

## Hebrews 12:19

and to the blast of a trumpet and the sound of words, which sound was such that those who heard begged that nothing further be spoken to them.

## Hebrews 12:20

For they could not cope with the command, “If even an animal touches the mountain, it shall be stoned.”

## Hebrews 12:21

And so terrifying was the sight, that Moses said, “I am terrified and trembling.”

## Hebrews 12:22

But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels,

## Hebrews 12:23

to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the Judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect,

## Hebrews 12:24

and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood, which speaks better than the blood of Abel.

## Hebrews 12:25

See to it that you do not refuse Him who is speaking. For if those did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, much less will we escape who turn away from Him who warns us from heaven.

## Hebrews 12:26

His voice shook the earth then, but now He has promised, saying, “Yet once more I will shake not only the earth, but also the heaven.”

## Hebrews 12:27

This expression, “Yet once more,” denotes the removal of those things which can be shaken, as of created things, so that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.

## Hebrews 12:28

Therefore, since we receive a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let’s show gratitude, by which we may offer to God an acceptable service with reverence and awe;

## Hebrews 12:29

for our God is a consuming fire.
