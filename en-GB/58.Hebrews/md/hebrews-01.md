# Hebrews Chapter 1

## Hebrews 1:1

In times past, God spoke to our forefathers through the prophets at various times and in many different ways,

## Hebrews 1:2

but in these last days, He has spoken to us through His Son, whom He appointed heir of all things and through whom He also created the universe.

## Hebrews 1:3

The Son is the radiance of God's glory and the exact likeness of His essence, sustaining all things by His powerful word. After He had provided purification for sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.

## Hebrews 1:4

Thus, He became as much superior to the angels as the name He has inherited is more excellent than theirs.

## Hebrews 1:5

For to which of the angels did God ever declare,

> “You are My Son; today
> I have become Your Father”?

Or again,

> “I will be His Father,
> and He will be My Son”?

## Hebrews 1:6

And once more, when God introduces His firstborn into the world, He proclaims,

> “Let all God's angels worship Him.”

## Hebrews 1:7

In speaking of the angels, He says,

> “He makes His angels winds,
> and His servants flames of fire.”

## Hebrews 1:8

But about the Son, He says,

> “Your throne, O God, is forever and ever;
> a sceptre of righteousness will be the sceptre of Your kingdom.

## Hebrews 1:9

> You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness;
> therefore God, Your God, has anointed You
> with the oil of joy above Your companions.”

## Hebrews 1:10

He also declares,

> “In the beginning, Lord, You established the foundations of the earth,
> and the heavens are the work of Your hands.

## Hebrews 1:11

> They will perish, but You remain;
> they will all wear out like a garment.

## Hebrews 1:12

> You will roll them up like a robe;
> like a garment, they will be changed.
> But You remain the same,
> and Your years will never end.”

## Hebrews 1:13

To which of the angels did God ever declare,

> “Sit at My right hand
> until I make Your enemies
> a footstool for Your feet”?

## Hebrews 1:14

Are not all angels ministering spirits sent out to serve those who will inherit salvation?
