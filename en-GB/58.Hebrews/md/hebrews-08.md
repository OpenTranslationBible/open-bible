# Hebrews Chapter 8

## Hebrews 8:1

The main point of what we are discussing is this: We have a high priest who has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,

## Hebrews 8:2

a minister in the sanctuary and in the true tabernacle, which the Lord established, not by human hands.

## Hebrews 8:3

Every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; thus it is necessary for this high priest also to have something to offer.

## Hebrews 8:4

If he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law.

## Hebrews 8:5

They serve at a sanctuary that is a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses was warned when he was about to construct the tabernacle: “See that you make everything according to the pattern shown to you on the mountain.”

## Hebrews 8:6

But now he has obtained a more excellent ministry, to the extent that he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which is established on better promises.

## Hebrews 8:7

For if the first covenant had been without fault, there would have been no need for a second.

## Hebrews 8:8

For finding fault with the people, he says:

> “Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord,
> when I will establish a new covenant
> with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.

## Hebrews 8:9

> It will not be like the covenant
> I made with their ancestors
> on the day I took them by the hand
> to lead them out of the land of Egypt;
> because they did not continue in my covenant,
> and I turned away from them, declares the Lord.

## Hebrews 8:10

> This is the covenant
> I will make with the house of Israel
> after those days, declares the Lord:
> I will put my laws into their minds
> and write them on their hearts.
> I will be their God,
> and they shall be my people.

## Hebrews 8:11

> And they will not teach, each one his neighbour,
> and each one his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’
> because they will all know me,
> from the least to the greatest of them.

## Hebrews 8:12

> For I will be merciful towards their wrongdoings,
> and their sins I will remember no more.”

## Hebrews 8:13

By calling this covenant “new,” he has made the first obsolete; and what is obsolete and ageing will soon disappear.
