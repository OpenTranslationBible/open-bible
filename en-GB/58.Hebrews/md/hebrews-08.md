# Hebrews Chapter 8

## Hebrews 8:1

Now the main point in what has been said is this: we have such a high priest, who has taken His seat at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,

## Hebrews 8:2

a minister in the sanctuary and in the true tabernacle, which the Lord set up, not man.

## Hebrews 8:3

For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; so it is necessary that this high priest also have something to offer.

## Hebrews 8:4

Now if He were on earth, He would not be a priest at all, since there are those who offer the gifts according to the Law;

## Hebrews 8:5

who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses was warned by God when he was about to erect the tabernacle; for, “See that you make all things by the pattern which was shown to you on the mountain.”

## Hebrews 8:6

But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, by as much as He is also the mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted on better promises.

## Hebrews 8:7

For if that first covenant had been free of fault, no circumstances would have been sought for a second.

## Hebrews 8:8

For in finding fault with the people, He says,

> “Behold, days are coming, says the Lord,  
> When I will bring about a new covenant  
> With the house of Israel and the house of Judah,

## Hebrews 8:9

> Not like the covenant  
> Which I made with their fathers  
> On the day I took them by the hand  
> To lead them out of the land of Egypt;  
> For they did not continue in My covenant,  
> And I did not care about them, says the Lord.

## Hebrews 8:10

> For this is the covenant  
> Which I will make with the house of Israel  
> After those days, declares the Lord:  
> I will put My laws into their minds,  
> And write them on their hearts.  
> And I will be their God,  
> And they shall be My people.

## Hebrews 8:11

> And they will not teach, each one his fellow citizen,  
> And each one his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’  
> For they will all know Me,  
> From the least to the greatest of them.

## Hebrews 8:12

> For I will be merciful toward their wrongdoings,  
> And their sins I will no longer remember.”

## Hebrews 8:13

When He said, “A new covenant,” He has made the first obsolete. But whatever is becoming obsolete and growing old is about to disappear.
