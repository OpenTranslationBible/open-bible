# Hebrews Chapter 9

## Hebrews 9:1
Now the first covenant included regulations for divine worship and an earthly sanctuary.

## Hebrews 9:2
A tabernacle was established, the outer room of which contained the lampstand, the table, and the sacred bread; this area is referred to as the Holy Place.

## Hebrews 9:3
Behind the second curtain was a chamber known as the Most Holy Place,

## Hebrews 9:4
which contained a golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant, covered entirely with gold. Inside this ark were a golden jar of manna, Aaron’s staff that budded, and the stone tablets of the covenant.

## Hebrews 9:5
Above the ark were the cherubim of glory, overshadowing the atonement cover. However, we cannot discuss these matters in detail at this time.

## Hebrews 9:6
When everything was arranged in this manner, the priests regularly entered the outer room to perform their duties.

## Hebrews 9:7
But only the high priest entered the inner room, and that only once a year, and never without blood, which he offered for himself and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance.

## Hebrews 9:8
The Holy Spirit was indicating that the way into the Most Holy Place had not yet been revealed while the first tabernacle was still standing.

## Hebrews 9:9
This serves as a symbol for the present time, showing that the gifts and sacrifices being offered were unable to perfect the conscience of the worshipper.

## Hebrews 9:10
These are merely regulations concerning food, drink, and various ceremonial washings—external ordinances imposed until the time of reformation.

## Hebrews 9:11
But when Christ came as high priest of the good things that have come, he passed through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is not made by human hands, that is, not of this creation.

## Hebrews 9:12
He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, he entered the Most Holy Place once for all, securing eternal redemption.

## Hebrews 9:13
For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so that they are outwardly clean,

## Hebrews 9:14
how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death, so that we may serve the living God!

## Hebrews 9:15
For this reason, Christ is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant.

## Hebrews 9:16
In the case of a will, it is necessary to establish the death of the one who made it,

## Hebrews 9:17
because a will is only in effect when someone has died; it is never valid while the one who made it is alive.

## Hebrews 9:18
This is why even the first covenant was not inaugurated without blood.

## Hebrews 9:19
When Moses had proclaimed every commandment of the law to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water, scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled the scroll and all the people.

## Hebrews 9:20
He said, “This is the blood of the covenant, which God has commanded you to keep.”

## Hebrews 9:21
In the same way, he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels used in its ceremonies.

## Hebrews 9:22
Indeed, according to the law, almost everything is cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.

## Hebrews 9:23
Thus, it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.

## Hebrews 9:24
For Christ did not enter a sanctuary made by human hands, a mere copy of the true one; he entered heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us.

## Hebrews 9:25
Nor did he enter heaven to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters the Most Holy Place every year with blood that is not his own.

## Hebrews 9:26
Otherwise, Christ would have had to suffer many times since the foundation of the world. But now, at the culmination of the ages, he has appeared once for all to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself.

## Hebrews 9:27
Just as people are destined to die once, and after that to face judgement,

## Hebrews 9:28
so Christ was sacrificed once to bear the sins of many; and he will appear a second time, not to deal with sin, but to bring salvation to those who are eagerly waiting for him.
