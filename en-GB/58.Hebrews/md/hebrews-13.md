# Hebrews Chapter 13

## Hebrews 13:1

Let the love for fellow believers continue.

## Hebrews 13:2

Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for by doing so some have entertained angels without realising it.

## Hebrews 13:3

Remember those in prison as if you were imprisoned with them, and those who are mistreated, as you also are in the body.

## Hebrews 13:4

Marriage should be honoured by everyone, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and the sexually immoral.

## Hebrews 13:5

Ensure that your character is free from the love of money, being content with what you have; for He has said,

> “I will never leave you, nor will I ever forsake you.”

## Hebrews 13:6

Thus we can say with confidence,

> “The Lord is my helper; I will not fear.
> What can mere humans do to me?”

## Hebrews 13:7

Remember your leaders who spoke the word of God to you. Reflect on the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith.

## Hebrews 13:8

Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.

## Hebrews 13:9

Do not be led astray by diverse and strange teachings; it is beneficial for the heart to be strengthened by grace, not by foods, which have not benefited those who are preoccupied with them.

We have an altar from which those who serve the tabernacle have no right to eat.

## Hebrews 13:11

The high priest carries the blood of animals into the Holy Place as a sin offering, but the bodies are burned outside the camp.

## Hebrews 13:14

For here we do not have a lasting city, but we seek the city that is to come.

Through Him, therefore, let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, which is the fruit of lips that acknowledge His name.

## Hebrews 13:16

Remember to do good and to share with others, for such sacrifices are pleasing to God.

## Hebrews 13:17

Have confidence in your leaders and submit to their authority, for they keep watch over your souls as those who must give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage to you.

## Hebrews 13:18

Pray for us, for we are sure that we have a clear conscience, desiring to conduct ourselves honourably in all things.

## Hebrews 13:19

I urge you all the more to pray, so that I may be restored to you more quickly.

## Hebrews 13:20

Now may the God of peace, who brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the eternal covenant,

## Hebrews 13:21

equip you with every good thing to do His will, working in us that which is pleasing in His sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.

## Hebrews 13:22

Brothers and sisters, I urge you to patiently listen to this word of exhortation, for I have written to you briefly.

## Hebrews 13:23

Know that our brother Timothy has been released. If he arrives soon, I will come with him to see you.

## Hebrews 13:24

Greet all your leaders and all the saints. Those from Italy send you their greetings.

## Hebrews 13:25

Grace be with you all.
