# Hebrews Chapter 4

## Hebrews 4:1

Therefore, let us be cautious that, while the promise of entering His rest still stands, none of you may seem to have fallen short of it.

## Hebrews 4:2

For indeed, we have had the good news preached to us, just as they did; but the message they heard did not benefit them, because they were not united with those who listened with faith.

## Hebrews 4:3

For we who have believed are entering that rest, just as He has said,

> “As I swore in My anger,
> ‘They shall certainly not enter My rest,’”
> although His works have been finished since the foundation of the world.

## Hebrews 4:4

For He has somewhere spoken about the seventh day in these words: “And God rested on the seventh day from all His works.”

## Hebrews 4:5

And again in this passage, “They shall certainly not enter My rest.”

## Hebrews 4:6

Therefore, since it remains for some to enter it, and those who previously had the good news proclaimed to them did not enter because of disobedience,

## Hebrews 4:7

He again designates a certain day, calling it “Today,” speaking through David after such a long time, as has been quoted before:

> “Today, if you hear His voice,
> do not harden your hearts.”

## Hebrews 4:8

For if Joshua had provided them with rest, God would not have mentioned another day later on.

## Hebrews 4:9

As a result, a Sabbath rest is still available for the people of God.

## Hebrews 4:10

For anyone who enters His rest also rests from their works, just as God did from His.

## Hebrews 4:11

Let us therefore make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall by following their example of disobedience.

## Hebrews 4:12

For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, penetrating even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and intentions of the heart.

## Hebrews 4:13

And there is nothing in all creation hidden from His sight. Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of Him to whom we must give account.

## Hebrews 4:14

Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess.

## Hebrews 4:15

For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathise with our weaknesses, but one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are, yet without sin.

## Hebrews 4:16

Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.
