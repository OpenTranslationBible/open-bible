# Hebrews Chapter 2

## Hebrews 2:1

For this reason, we must pay the utmost attention to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away from it.

## Hebrews 2:2

For if the message spoken through angels was unchangeable, and every transgression and disobedience received a just penalty,

## Hebrews 2:3

how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? This salvation, which was initially spoken by the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard him.

## Hebrews 2:4

God also bore witness to it with signs, wonders, and various miracles, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to His will.

## Hebrews 2:5

For it is not to angels that He has subjected the world to come, about which we are speaking.

## Hebrews 2:6

But someone has testified somewhere, saying,

> “What is man, that You are mindful of him,
> or the son of man, that You care for him?

## Hebrews 2:7

> You made him a little lower than the angels;
> You crowned him with glory and honour

## Hebrews 2:8

> and placed everything under his feet.”

In subjecting all things to him, He left nothing that is not subject to him. Yet at present, we do not see everything subjected to him.

## Hebrews 2:9

But we do see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for a short time, now crowned with glory and honour because of His suffering and death, so that by the grace of God, He might taste death for everyone.

## Hebrews 2:10

For it was fitting for Him, for whom and through whom everything exists, in bringing many sons and daughters to glory, to make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through sufferings.

## Hebrews 2:11

For both the one who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one Father. For this reason, He is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters,

## Hebrews 2:12

saying,

> “I will declare Your name to My brothers
> and sisters; in the midst of the assembly,
> I will sing Your praises.”

## Hebrews 2:13

And again,

> “I will put My trust in Him.”

And again,

> “Here am I, and the children God has given Me.”

## Hebrews 2:14

Since the children share in flesh and blood, He Himself likewise partook of the same, so that through death He might destroy the one who holds the power of death, that is, the devil,

## Hebrews 2:15

and free those who through fear of death were held in slavery all their lives.

## Hebrews 2:16

For surely He does not assist angels, but He helps the descendants of Abraham.

## Hebrews 2:17

Therefore, He had to be made like His brothers in every respect, so that He might become a merciful and faithful high priest in matters relating to God, to make atonement for the sins of the people.

## Hebrews 2:18

For since He Himself was tempted in what He suffered, He is able to help those who are being tempted.
