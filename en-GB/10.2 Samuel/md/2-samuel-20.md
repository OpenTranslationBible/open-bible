# 2 Samuel Chapter 20

## 2 Samuel 20:1

Now a worthless man happened to be there, whose name was Sheba the son of Bichri, a Benjaminite.  
He blew the trumpet and said,  
“We have no share in David,  
nor inheritance in the son of Jesse;  
every man to his tents, O Israel!”

## 2 Samuel 20:2

So all the men of Israel withdrew from David and followed Sheba the son of Bichri.  
But the men of Judah remained steadfast to their king,  
from the Jordan to Jerusalem.

## 2 Samuel 20:3

Then David came to his house at Jerusalem.  
And the king took the ten women, the concubines whom he had left to keep the house,  
and put them in confinement and provided for them,  
but did not go in to them.  
So they were shut up until the day of their death,  
living as widows.

## 2 Samuel 20:4

Then the king instructed Amasa,  
“Gather the men of Judah for me within three days,  
and ensure you are present here yourself.”

## 2 Samuel 20:5

So Amasa went to summon Judah,  
but he delayed beyond the time set for him.

## 2 Samuel 20:6

Then David said to Abishai,  
“Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom.  
Take your lord’s servants and pursue him quickly,  
so that he does not find fortified cities and escape from our sight.”

## 2 Samuel 20:7

So Joab’s men went out after him,  
along with the Cherethites, the Pelethites, and all the mighty men;  
and they went out from Jerusalem to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.

## 2 Samuel 20:8

When they were at the great stone that is in Gibeon,  
Amasa came to meet them.  
Now Joab was wearing his military tunic,  
and over it was a belt with a sword in its sheath fastened at his waist;  
and as he stepped forward, it fell out.

## 2 Samuel 20:9

And Joab greeted Amasa,  
“Is all well with you, my brother?”  
And Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.

## 2 Samuel 20:10

But Amasa did not notice the sword in Joab’s hand.  
So Joab struck him in the stomach with it and poured out his entrails to the ground,  
and he died without being struck again.  
Then Joab and Abishai his brother pursued Sheba the son of Bichri.

## 2 Samuel 20:11

Now one of Joab’s young men stood by him and said,  
“Whoever favours Joab and whoever is for David,  
let him follow Joab!”

## 2 Samuel 20:12

But Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the middle of the road.  
And when the man saw that all the people stood still,  
he removed Amasa from the road into the field and threw a garment over him,  
because he saw that everyone who came by him stood still.

## 2 Samuel 20:13

When he was removed from the road,  
everyone passed on after Joab to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.

## 2 Samuel 20:14

Now he went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel,  
even Beth-maacah, and all the Bichrites gathered and also went after him.

## 2 Samuel 20:15

They came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maacah,  
and they cast up a mound against the city,  
and it stood by the rampart;  
and all the people who were with Joab were battering the wall to bring it down.

## 2 Samuel 20:16

Then a wise woman called from the city,  
“Listen, listen! Please tell Joab, ‘Come here that I may speak with you.’”

## 2 Samuel 20:17

So he approached her, and the woman said,  
“Are you Joab?”  
And he answered, “I am.”  
Then she said to him,  
“Listen to the words of your servant.”  
And he said, “I am listening.”

## 2 Samuel 20:18

Then she spoke, saying,  
“They used to say in former times,  
‘Let them ask advice at Abel,’  
and so they settled disputes.

## 2 Samuel 20:19

I am among the peaceable and faithful in Israel.  
You seek to destroy a city and a mother in Israel.  
Why would you swallow up the Lord’s inheritance?”

## 2 Samuel 20:20

Joab replied,  
“Far be it, far be it from me that I would swallow up or destroy!

## 2 Samuel 20:21

That is not the case.  
A man from the hill country of Ephraim,  
Sheba the son of Bichri by name,  
has lifted up his hand against King David.  
Deliver him only, and I will withdraw from the city.”  
The woman said to Joab,  
“Behold, his head shall be thrown to you over the wall.”

---

## 2 Samuel 20:22

Then the woman wisely came to all the people.  
And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri and threw it to Joab.  
So he blew the trumpet, and they were dispersed from the city,  
every man to his tent.  
Joab returned to the king at Jerusalem.

---

## 2 Samuel 20:23

Now Joab was over the entire army of Israel,  
and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites.

## 2 Samuel 20:24

Adoram was over the forced labour,  
and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder.

## 2 Samuel 20:25

Sheva was secretary,  
and Zadok and Abiathar were priests.

## 2 Samuel 20:26

And Ira the Jairite also was a priest to David.
