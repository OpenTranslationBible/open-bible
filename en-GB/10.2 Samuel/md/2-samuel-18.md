# 2 Samuel Chapter 18

## 2 Samuel 18:1

Then David mustered the people who were with him,  
and set over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds.

## 2 Samuel 18:2

David sent out the army: one third under Joab,  
one third under Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother,  
and one third under Ittai the Gittite.  
And the king said to the people,  
“I myself will surely go out with you also.”

## 2 Samuel 18:3

But the people said,  
“You shall not go out. For if we flee, they will not care about us;  
even if half of us die, they will not care.  
But you are worth ten thousand of us.  
Therefore it is better that you be ready to send help from the city.”

## 2 Samuel 18:4

The king said to them,  
“Whatever seems best in your sight I will do.”  
So the king stood beside the gate,  
and all the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.

## 2 Samuel 18:5

And the king commanded Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, saying,  
“Deal gently for my sake with the young man Absalom.”  
And all the people heard the king give orders concerning Absalom to the commanders.

## 2 Samuel 18:6

Then the people went out into the field to meet Israel,  
and the battle was fought in the forest of Ephraim.

## 2 Samuel 18:7

There the people of Israel were defeated by the servants of David,  
and the slaughter there that day was great—twenty thousand men.

## 2 Samuel 18:8

The battle spread over the entire countryside,  
and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.

## 2 Samuel 18:9

Now Absalom encountered the servants of David.  
Absalom was riding on his mule,  
and the mule went under the thick branches of a great oak.  
His head caught fast in the tree,  
and he was left hanging between heaven and earth,  
while the mule that was under him kept going.

## 2 Samuel 18:10

A certain man saw it and told Joab,  
“Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree.”

## 2 Samuel 18:11

Then Joab said to the man who had told him,  
“You saw him! Why then did you not strike him there to the ground?  
I would have given you ten pieces of silver and a belt.”

## 2 Samuel 18:12

But the man said to Joab,  
“Even if I were to receive a thousand pieces of silver,  
I would not reach out my hand against the king’s son;  
for in our hearing the king commanded you, Abishai, and Ittai, saying,  
‘Protect the young man Absalom for my sake.’

## 2 Samuel 18:13

Otherwise, if I had dealt treacherously against his life,  
and nothing is hidden from the king,  
then you yourself would have stood aloof.”

## 2 Samuel 18:14

Then Joab said,  
“I will not waste time with you.”  
So he took three spears in his hand  
and thrust them into the heart of Absalom while he was still alive in the midst of the oak.

## 2 Samuel 18:15

And ten young men who carried Joab’s armour surrounded Absalom  
and struck him and killed him.

## 2 Samuel 18:16

Then Joab blew the trumpet,  
and the people returned from pursuing Israel,  
for Joab restrained the troops.

## 2 Samuel 18:17

They took Absalom and threw him into a great pit in the forest,  
and erected a very large heap of stones over him.  
And all Israel fled, each to his tent.

## 2 Samuel 18:18

Now Absalom during his lifetime had taken and set up for himself a pillar,  
which is in the King’s Valley,  
for he said, “I have no son to preserve my name.”  
And he called the pillar after his own name,  
and it is called Absalom’s Monument to this day.

## 2 Samuel 18:19

Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said,  
“Let me run and carry the news to the king,  
that the Lord has vindicated him by delivering him from the hand of his enemies.”

## 2 Samuel 18:20

But Joab said to him,  
“You shall not carry news today, but you shall carry news another day.  
Today you shall not deliver the news,  
because the king’s son is dead.”

## 2 Samuel 18:21

Then Joab said to a Cushite,  
“Go, tell the king what you have seen.”  
So the Cushite bowed to Joab and ran.

## 2 Samuel 18:22

Ahimaaz the son of Zadok again said to Joab,  
“Whatever may happen, please let me also run after the Cushite.”  
And Joab said, “Why would you run, my son, seeing you have no reward for the news?”

## 2 Samuel 18:23

“But whatever may come,” he said, “I will run.”  
So he said to him, “Run.”  
Then Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain and outran the Cushite.

## 2 Samuel 18:24

Now David was sitting between the two gates,  
and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate by the wall,  
and he raised his eyes and looked, and behold, a man was running alone.

## 2 Samuel 18:25

The watchman called and told the king.  
And the king said, “If he is alone, there is good news in his mouth.”  
And he came closer and closer.

## 2 Samuel 18:26

Then the watchman saw another man running,  
and the watchman called to the gatekeeper and said,  
“Behold, another man is running alone.”  
And the king said, “He also is bringing good news.”

## 2 Samuel 18:27

The watchman said,  
“I think the running of the first is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.”  
And the king said, “He is a good man, and he comes with good news.”

## 2 Samuel 18:28

Then Ahimaaz cried out and said to the king,  
“All is well.”  
And he prostrated himself before the king with his face to the ground and said,  
“Blessed be the Lord your God,  
who has delivered up the men who raised their hand against my lord the king.”

## 2 Samuel 18:29

The king said,  
“Is it well with the young man Absalom?”  
And Ahimaaz answered,  
“When Joab sent the king’s servant, your servant, I saw a great commotion,  
but I did not know what it was.”

## 2 Samuel 18:30

The king instructed him, “Step aside and wait here.”  
So he stepped aside and waited.

## 2 Samuel 18:31

Then behold, the Cushite arrived and said,  
“Let my lord the king receive good news,  
for the Lord has vindicated you this day  
by delivering you from the hand of all who rose up against you.”

## 2 Samuel 18:32

And the king said to the Cushite,  
“Is it well with the young man Absalom?”  
And the Cushite answered,  
“May the enemies of my lord the king, and all who rise up against you for evil,  
be like that young man.”

## 2 Samuel 18:33

Then the king was deeply shaken,  
and he went up to the chamber over the gate and wept.  
As he went, he said,  
“O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom!  
Would that I had died instead of you,  
O Absalom, my son, my son!”
