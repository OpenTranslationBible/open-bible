# 2 Samuel Chapter 11

## 2 Samuel 11:1

Then it happened in the spring, at the time when kings go out to battle,  
that David sent Joab and his servants with him, and all Israel,  
and they destroyed the sons of Ammon and besieged Rabbah.  
But David stayed behind in Jerusalem.

## 2 Samuel 11:2

One evening, David rose from his bed and strolled on the roof of the king’s house.  
From there, he saw a woman bathing, and she was very beautiful.

## 2 Samuel 11:3

David sent servants to inquire about the woman.  
And someone said,  
“Is this not Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?”

## 2 Samuel 11:4

Then David sent messengers and took her, and when she came to him, he slept with her  
—now she had purified herself from her uncleanness—  
then she returned to her house.

## 2 Samuel 11:5

And the woman conceived;  
so she sent word to David, and said, “I am pregnant.”

## 2 Samuel 11:6

David then sent a message to Joab, saying, “Send Uriah the Hittite to me.”  
So Joab sent Uriah to David.

## 2 Samuel 11:7

When Uriah came to him, David asked about Joab’s well-being and the people’s well-being and the state of the war.

## 2 Samuel 11:8

David said to Uriah, “Go down to your house, and refresh yourself.”  
So Uriah left the king’s house, and a gift from the king followed him.

## 2 Samuel 11:9

However, Uriah slept at the entrance of the king’s house with all the servants of his lord,  
and did not go down to his house.

## 2 Samuel 11:10

When they informed David, saying, “Uriah did not go down to his house,”  
David said to Uriah, “Have you not come from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?”

## 2 Samuel 11:11

And Uriah said to David,  
“The ark and Israel and Judah are staying in temporary shelters,  
and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are camping in the open field.  
Shall I then go to my house to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife?  
By your life and the life of your soul, I will not do this thing.”

## 2 Samuel 11:12

Then David said to Uriah, “Stay here today also, and tomorrow I will send you back.”  
So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next.

## 2 Samuel 11:13

Now David summoned him, and he ate and drank before him, and he made him drunk.  
In the evening he went out to lie on his bed with his lord’s servants,  
but he did not go down to his house.

## 2 Samuel 11:14

In the morning, David gave a letter to Joab who sent it with Uriah.

## 2 Samuel 11:15

He had written in the letter, saying,  
“Place Uriah on the front line of the fiercest battle,  
and pull back from him, so that he may be struck and die.”

## 2 Samuel 11:16

So it was as Joab kept watch on the city,  
he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew there were valiant men.

## 2 Samuel 11:17

The men of the city went out and fought against Joab,  
and some of the people among David’s servants fell;  
Uriah the Hittite also died.

## 2 Samuel 11:18

Then Joab sent word and reported to David all the events of the war.

## 2 Samuel 11:19

He commanded the messenger, saying,  
“When you have finished reporting all the events of the war to the king,

## 2 Samuel 11:20

and if the king’s anger arises and he says to you,  
‘Why did you approach the city so closely to fight?  
Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall?

## 2 Samuel 11:21

Who struck Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth?  
Did a woman not throw an upper millstone on him from the wall so that he died at Thebez?  
Why did you go so near the wall?’  
—then you shall say,  
‘Your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.’”

---

## 2 Samuel 11:22

So the messenger departed and came and told David everything that Joab had sent him to report.

## 2 Samuel 11:23

And the messenger said to David,  
“The men gained the upper hand against us and came out to us in the field,  
but we drove them back to the entrance of the gate.

## 2 Samuel 11:24

Then the archers shot at your servants from the wall;  
some of the king’s servants died,  
and your servant Uriah the Hittite also died.”

## 2 Samuel 11:25

Then David said to the messenger,  
“This is what you shall say to Joab:  
‘Do not let this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another;  
strengthen your battle against the city and overthrow it’;  
and encourage him.”

## 2 Samuel 11:26

Now when the wife of Uriah heard that her husband Uriah was dead,  
she mourned for her husband.

## 2 Samuel 11:27

When the time of mourning was over,  
David sent servants and brought her to his house, and she became his wife;  
then she bore him a son.  
But the thing that David had done was evil in the sight of the Lord.
