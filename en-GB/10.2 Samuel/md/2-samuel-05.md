## 2 Samuel 5:1

Then all the tribes of Israel gathered to David at Hebron and said,  
“Behold, we are of your own kin and flesh.

## 2 Samuel 5:2

In times past, when Saul was king over us,  
you were the one who led Israel out and brought them in.  
And the Lord said to you,  
‘You shall shepherd My people Israel, and you shall be a ruler over Israel.’”

## 2 Samuel 5:3

So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron,  
and King David made a covenant with them there before the Lord;  
and they anointed David king over Israel.

## 2 Samuel 5:4

David was thirty years old when he began his reign,  
and he ruled for forty years.

## 2 Samuel 5:5

He reigned in Hebron over Judah for seven years and six months,  
and in Jerusalem he reigned for thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.

## 2 Samuel 5:6

Now the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites,  
the inhabitants of the land.  
And they said to David,  
“You shall not come in here, but the blind and the lame will turn you away,”  
thinking, “David cannot enter here.”

## 2 Samuel 5:7

Yet, David captured the stronghold of Zion,  
which is known as the city of David.

## 2 Samuel 5:8

And David said on that day,  
“Whoever attacks the Jebusites must strike through the water tunnel to reach the lame and the blind,  
who are despised by David’s soul.”  
Therefore they say, “The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.”

## 2 Samuel 5:9

So David lived in the stronghold and called it the city of David.  
And he built all around from the Millo and inward.

## 2 Samuel 5:10

And David became greater and greater,  
for the Lord God of armies was with him.

## 2 Samuel 5:11

Hiram, king of Tyre, sent messengers to David with cedar trees,  
along with carpenters and stonemasons;  
and they constructed a house for David.

## 2 Samuel 5:12

And David realised that the Lord had established him as king over Israel,  
and that He had exalted his kingdom for the sake of His people Israel.

## 2 Samuel 5:13

Meanwhile, David took additional concubines and wives from Jerusalem after he came from Hebron,  
and more sons and daughters were born to him.

## 2 Samuel 5:14

The children born to him in Jerusalem were:  
Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,

## 2 Samuel 5:15

Ibhar, and Elishua, Nepheg, and Japhia,

## 2 Samuel 5:16

and Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.

## 2 Samuel 5:17

When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel,  
all the Philistines went up to search for David.  
And David heard about it and went down to the stronghold.

## 2 Samuel 5:18

The Philistines advanced and spread throughout the valley of Rephaim.

## 2 Samuel 5:19

So David inquired of the Lord, asking,  
“Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will You deliver them into my hand?”  
And the Lord replied to David,  
“Go up, for I will surely deliver the Philistines into your hand.”

## 2 Samuel 5:20

So David went to Baal-perazim and defeated them there;  
and he declared,  
“The Lord has broken through my enemies before me like a breakthrough of waters.”  
Therefore, he named that place Baal-perazim.

## 2 Samuel 5:21

The Philistines left their idols there,  
so David and his men took them away.

---

## 2 Samuel 5:22

The Philistines came up once again  
and spread throughout the valley of Rephaim.

## 2 Samuel 5:23

So David inquired of the Lord, and He said,  
“You shall not go directly up; circle around behind them  
and come at them in front of the balsam trees.

## 2 Samuel 5:24

And it shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees,  
then act promptly, for the Lord will have gone out before you  
to strike the army of the Philistines.”

## 2 Samuel 5:25

Then David did so, just as the Lord had commanded him,  
and he struck and defeated the Philistines from Geba as far as Gezer.
