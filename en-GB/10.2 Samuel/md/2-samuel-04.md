# 2 Samuel Chapter 4

## 2 Samuel 4:1

Now when Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, heard that Abner had died in Hebron,  
his courage failed, and all Israel was disturbed.

## 2 Samuel 4:2

And Saul’s son had two men who were commanders of raiding bands;  
the name of the one was Baanah and the name of the other Rechab, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite,  
of the sons of Benjamin (for Beeroth is also considered part of Benjamin,

## 2 Samuel 4:3

and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and have lived there as strangers to this day).

## 2 Samuel 4:4

Now Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son who was crippled in both feet.  
He was five years old when the news of Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel,  
and his nurse picked him up and fled.  
But it happened that in her hurry to flee, he fell and became lame.  
And his name was Mephibosheth.

## 2 Samuel 4:5

So the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah,  
went and came to the house of Ish-bosheth in the heat of the day, while he was lying on his bed at noon.

## 2 Samuel 4:6

And they entered the house as if to get wheat,  
and they struck him in the stomach;  
and Rechab and his brother Baanah escaped.

## 2 Samuel 4:7

Now when they came into the house, as he was lying on his bed in his bedroom,  
they struck and killed him and beheaded him.  
And they took his head and travelled by way of the Arabah all night.

## 2 Samuel 4:8

Then they brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David at Hebron,  
and said to the king,  
“Behold, the head of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life;  
the Lord has given my lord the king vengeance this day on Saul and his descendants.”

## 2 Samuel 4:9

But David replied to Rechab and Baanah his brother, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them,  
“As the Lord lives, who has redeemed my life from all distress,

## 2 Samuel 4:10

when one informed me, saying, ‘Behold, Saul is dead,’  
thinking he was bringing good news,  
I seized him and killed him in Ziklag—this was the reward I gave him for his news.

## 2 Samuel 4:11

How much more, when wicked men have killed a righteous man in his own house on his bed,  
shall I not now require his blood from your hands and eliminate you from the earth?”

## 2 Samuel 4:12

Then David instructed the young men, and they executed them and severed their hands and feet,  
and displayed them beside the pool in Hebron.  
However, they took the head of Ish-bosheth and laid it to rest in the grave of Abner in Hebron.
