# 2 Samuel Chapter 14

## 2 Samuel 14:1

Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart was concerned about Absalom.

## 2 Samuel 14:2

So Joab sent to Tekoa and brought from there a wise woman.  
He said to her, “Please pretend to be in mourning, and put on garments of grief.  
Do not anoint yourself with oil, but act like a woman who has long been mourning for the dead.

## 2 Samuel 14:3

Then approach the king and speak to him in this way.”  
Joab instructed her on what to say.

## 2 Samuel 14:4

When the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and paid homage, saying,  
“Help me, O king.”

## 2 Samuel 14:5

The king said to her, “What troubles you?”  
And she answered, “Truly I am a widow, for my husband is dead.

## 2 Samuel 14:6

Now your servant had two sons, but the two of them quarrelled in the field,  
and there was no one to separate them.  
One struck the other and killed him.

## 2 Samuel 14:7

Now the entire family has risen against your servant, saying,  
‘Bring him who struck his brother, that we may put him to death for killing his brother.’  
They would also destroy the heir,  
and so they would extinguish my burning coal that is left,  
leaving neither name nor remnant on the earth for my husband.”

## 2 Samuel 14:8

Then the king said to the woman, “Return to your home, and I will issue instructions regarding your case.”

## 2 Samuel 14:9

The woman of Tekoa said to the king,  
“My lord the king, let the guilt be on me and on my father’s house,  
and may the king and his throne be guiltless.”

## 2 Samuel 14:10

The king said, “If anyone troubles you, bring him to me,  
and he will not bother you again.”

## 2 Samuel 14:11

Then she said, “Please let the king remember the Lord your God,  
that the avenger of blood may not destroy any more,  
so that they will not eliminate my son.”  
And he said, “As the Lord lives, not a hair of your son shall fall to the ground.”

## 2 Samuel 14:12

Then the woman said, “Please allow your servant to speak a word to my lord the king.”  
And he said, “Speak.”

## 2 Samuel 14:13

So the woman said,  
“Why then have you planned such a thing against the people of God?  
For in speaking this word, the king is as one who is guilty,  
in that the king does not bring back his banished one.

## 2 Samuel 14:14

For we will surely die, and are like water spilled on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again.  
Yet God does not take away life, but devises means so that the banished one may not remain outcast from Him.

## 2 Samuel 14:15

Now I have come to speak of this matter to my lord the king,  
because the people have made me afraid.  
So your servant said, ‘Let me speak to the king; perhaps the king will act on the request of his servant.

## 2 Samuel 14:16

For the king will hear and deliver his servant from the hand of the man  
who seeks to cut me off and my son from the inheritance of God.’

## 2 Samuel 14:17

Then your servant thought, ‘The word of my lord the king will bring rest,  
for my lord the king is like the angel of God,  
to discern good and evil.  
And may the Lord your God be with you.’”

## 2 Samuel 14:18

Then the king answered and said to the woman,  
“Please do not hide anything from me that I am about to ask you.”  
And the woman said, “Let my lord the king speak.”

## 2 Samuel 14:19

So the king said, “Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?”  
And the woman answered, “As your soul lives, my lord the king,  
no one can turn to the right or to the left from anything that my lord the king has spoken.  
It was indeed your servant Joab who commanded me,  
and it was he who put all these words in the mouth of your servant.

## 2 Samuel 14:20

Your servant Joab has done this in order to bring about this change in the situation.  
But my lord is wise, like the wisdom of the angel of God, to know all that is in the earth.”

---

## 2 Samuel 14:21

Then the king said to Joab,  
“Behold now, I will do this thing.  
Go therefore, bring back the young man Absalom.”

## 2 Samuel 14:22

Joab fell on his face to the ground, prostrated himself, and blessed the king.  
Then Joab said, “Today your servant knows that I have found favour in your sight,  
my lord the king, because the king has done the request of his servant.”

## 2 Samuel 14:23

So Joab set out for Geshur and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem.

## 2 Samuel 14:24

However, the king said, “Let him turn to his own house, and not see my face.”  
So Absalom turned to his own house and did not see the king’s face.

---

## 2 Samuel 14:25

Now in all Israel there was no one as praised for his appearance as Absalom;  
from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head, there was no defect in him.

## 2 Samuel 14:26

And when he cut the hair of his head—for it was at the end of every year that he cut it,  
because it was heavy on him, and when he cut it, he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels by the king’s weight.

## 2 Samuel 14:27

Absalom had three sons and a daughter named Tamar.  
She was a woman of beautiful appearance.

---

## 2 Samuel 14:28

Absalom remained in Jerusalem for two complete years without seeing the king’s face.

## 2 Samuel 14:29

Then Absalom sent for Joab to send him to the king, but he did not come to him.  
So he sent again a second time, but he still did not come.

## 2 Samuel 14:30

Therefore he instructed his servants,  
“See, Joab’s field is next to mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire.”  
So Absalom’s servants set the field ablaze.

## 2 Samuel 14:31

Then Joab arose and came to Absalom at his house and said to him,  
“Why have your servants set my field on fire?”

## 2 Samuel 14:32

Absalom answered Joab,  
“Behold, I sent to you, saying, ‘Come here, that I may send you to the king, to say,  
Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me to still be there.’  
Now therefore, let me see the king’s face;  
and if there is guilt in me, let him put me to death.”

## 2 Samuel 14:33

So Joab came to the king and told him.  
Then he called for Absalom, who came to the king and prostrated himself with his face to the ground before the king,  
and the king kissed Absalom.
