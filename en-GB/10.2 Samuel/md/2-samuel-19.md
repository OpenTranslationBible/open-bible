# 2 Samuel Chapter 19

## 2 Samuel 19:1

Then it was reported to Joab,  
“Behold, the king is weeping and mourning for Absalom.”

## 2 Samuel 19:2

So the victory that day was turned into mourning for all the people,  
for the people heard it said that day,  
“The king is grieving over his son.”

## 2 Samuel 19:3

And the people stole away into the city that day  
as people steal away who are humiliated when they flee in battle.

## 2 Samuel 19:4

The king hid his face and lamented loudly,  
“O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!”

## 2 Samuel 19:5

Then Joab came into the house to the king and said,  
“Today you have shamed all your servants,  
who this day have saved your life and the lives of your sons and daughters,  
the lives of your wives and the lives of your concubines,

## 2 Samuel 19:6

by loving those who hate you and hating those who love you.  
You have made it clear today that commanders and servants are nothing to you.  
For today I see that if Absalom were alive and all of us were dead, then it would please you.

## 2 Samuel 19:7

Now therefore arise, go out and speak kindly to your servants,  
for I swear by the Lord, if you do not go out,  
not a man will stay with you tonight.  
And this will be worse for you than all the calamity that has come upon you from your youth until now.”

## 2 Samuel 19:8

So the king arose and sat in the gate.  
And when it was told to all the people, saying,  
“Behold, the king is sitting in the gate,”  
then all the people came before the king.

Now Israel had fled, each to his tent.

## 2 Samuel 19:9

All the people throughout all the tribes of Israel were arguing, saying,  
“The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies  
and rescued us from the hand of the Philistines,  
but now he has fled out of the land from Absalom.

## 2 Samuel 19:10

And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle.  
Now therefore, why do you say nothing about bringing the king back?”

## 2 Samuel 19:11

Then King David sent word to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, saying,  
“Speak to the elders of Judah, saying,  
‘Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house,  
since the word of all Israel has come to the king, to return him to his house?

## 2 Samuel 19:12

You are my kin; you are my own flesh and blood.  
Why then should you be the last to bring back the king?’

## 2 Samuel 19:13

And say to Amasa,  
‘Are you not my bone and my flesh?  
God do so to me and more also if you will not be commander of the army before me continually in place of Joab.’”

## 2 Samuel 19:14

So he turned the heart of all the men of Judah as one man,  
so that they sent word to the king, saying,  
“Return, you and all your servants.”

## 2 Samuel 19:15

Then the king returned and came as far as the Jordan.  
And the men of Judah came to Gilgal to meet the king,  
to escort the king over the Jordan.

## 2 Samuel 19:16

Then Shimei son of Gera, the Benjaminite from Bahurim,  
hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet King David.

## 2 Samuel 19:17

And a thousand men from Benjamin were with him,  
and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul,  
with his fifteen sons and twenty servants;  
and they rushed to the Jordan before the king.

## 2 Samuel 19:18

They crossed the ford to bring over the king’s household and to do what pleased him.  
Then Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king  
as he was about to cross the Jordan.

## 2 Samuel 19:19

He said to the king,  
“Let not my lord hold me guilty,  
nor remember what your servant did wrong on the day my lord the king went out from Jerusalem,  
that the king should take it to heart.

## 2 Samuel 19:20

For your servant knows that I have sinned.  
Therefore, behold, I have come today,  
first of all the house of Joseph,  
to go down to meet my lord the king.”

## 2 Samuel 19:21

But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said,  
“Should not Shimei be put to death for this,  
because he cursed the Lord’s anointed?”

## 2 Samuel 19:22

But David said,  
“What is it to me or to you, sons of Zeruiah,  
that you should today become an adversary to me?  
Should any man in Israel be put to death today?  
For do I not know that I am king over Israel today?”

## 2 Samuel 19:23

So the king said to Shimei,  
“You shall not die.”  
And the king swore to him.

## 2 Samuel 19:24

Then Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king.  
He had not taken care of his feet, nor trimmed his beard,  
nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he returned in peace.

## 2 Samuel 19:25

It happened when he came to Jerusalem to meet the king,  
the king said to him,  
“Why did you not go with me, Mephibosheth?”

## 2 Samuel 19:26

He answered,  
“My lord the king, my servant deceived me.  
For your servant said, ‘I will saddle a donkey for myself,  
so that I may ride on it and go with the king,’  
because your servant is lame.

## 2 Samuel 19:27

And he has slandered your servant to my lord the king.  
But my lord the king is like the angel of God;  
therefore do what seems good to you.

## 2 Samuel 19:28

For all my father’s house were but dead men before my lord the king;  
yet you set your servant among those who eat at your table.  
What right therefore have I to cry out any more to the king?”

## 2 Samuel 19:29

So the king said to him,  
“Why do you speak any more of your matters?  
I have decided: you and Ziba shall divide the land.”

## 2 Samuel 19:30

And Mephibosheth said to the king,  
“Let him take it all, since my lord the king has come back in peace to his own house.”

## 2 Samuel 19:31

Now Barzillai the Gileadite had come down from Rogelim,  
and he went over the Jordan with the king, to escort him over the Jordan.

## 2 Samuel 19:32

Barzillai was an elderly man, eighty years old,  
and he had provided the king with food while he stayed at Mahanaim,  
for he was a man of great wealth.

## 2 Samuel 19:33

The king said to Barzillai,  
“Come over with me and I will provide for you with me in Jerusalem.”

## 2 Samuel 19:34

But Barzillai said to the king,  
“How long do I have to live, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?

## 2 Samuel 19:35

I am this day eighty years old.  
Can I discern between good and bad?  
Can your servant taste what he eats or what he drinks?  
Can I still hear the voice of singing men and singing women?  
Why then should your servant be a burden to my lord the king?

## 2 Samuel 19:36

Your servant would merely cross the Jordan with the king.  
Why should the king repay me with such a reward?

## 2 Samuel 19:37

Please let your servant return, that I may die in my own city  
near the grave of my father and mother.  
But here is your servant Chimham; let him cross over with my lord the king,  
and do for him whatever seems good to you.”

## 2 Samuel 19:38

And the king answered,  
“Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do for him whatever seems good to you.  
Whatever you desire from me, I will do for you.”

## 2 Samuel 19:39

So all the people crossed over the Jordan,  
and the king also crossed.  
And the king kissed Barzillai and blessed him,  
and he returned to his own place.

---

## 2 Samuel 19:40

Now the king went on to Gilgal,  
and Chimham went on with him.  
All the people of Judah and also half the people of Israel  
escorted the king.

## 2 Samuel 19:41

And behold, all the men of Israel came to the king and said to him,  
“Why have our brothers, the men of Judah, stolen you away,  
and brought the king and his household over the Jordan,  
and all David’s men with him?”

## 2 Samuel 19:42

All the men of Judah answered the men of Israel,  
“Because the king is closely related to us.  
Why are you angry about this?  
Have we eaten at the king’s expense, or has he given us any gift?”

## 2 Samuel 19:43

Then the men of Israel answered the men of Judah and said,  
“We have ten shares in the king;  
therefore we also have more claim on David than you.  
Why then did you treat us with contempt?  
Were we not the first to speak of bringing back our king?”  
But the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.
