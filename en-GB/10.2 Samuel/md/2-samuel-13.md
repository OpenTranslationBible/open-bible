# 2 Samuel Chapter 13

## 2 Samuel 13:1

Now it happened afterward that Absalom the son of David had a beautiful sister whose name was Tamar,  
and Amnon the son of David loved her.

## 2 Samuel 13:2

Amnon was so frustrated because of his sister Tamar that he made himself ill,  
for she was a virgin, and it seemed difficult to Amnon to do anything to her.

## 2 Samuel 13:3

Amnon had a companion named Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother;  
and Jonadab was known for his cunning.

## 2 Samuel 13:4

He said to him, “Why are you, the king’s son, so depressed morning after morning? Will you not tell me?”  
Then Amnon said to him, “I am in love with Tamar, the sister of my brother Absalom.”

## 2 Samuel 13:5

Jonadab then said to him, “Lie down on your bed and pretend to be ill,  
and when your father comes to see you, say to him,  
‘Please let my sister Tamar come and give me some food to eat,  
and let her prepare the food in my sight, so that I may see it and eat from her hand.’”

## 2 Samuel 13:6

So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill,  
and when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king,  
“Please let my sister Tamar come and make me a couple of cakes in my sight,  
so that I may eat from her hand.”

## 2 Samuel 13:7

Then David sent word to the house of Tamar, saying,  
“Go now to your brother Amnon’s house, and prepare food for him.”

## 2 Samuel 13:8

So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house, where he was lying down.  
She took dough, kneaded it, made cakes in his presence, and baked them.

## 2 Samuel 13:9

Then she took the pan and dished them out before him,  
but he refused to eat.  
And Amnon said, “Have everyone leave me.”  
So everyone left him.

## 2 Samuel 13:10

Then Amnon said to Tamar,  
“Bring the food into the bedroom, so that I may eat from your hand.”  
So Tamar took the cakes which she had made and brought them into the bedroom to her brother Amnon.

## 2 Samuel 13:11

When she brought them to him to eat, he seized her and said to her,  
“Come, lie with me, my sister.”

## 2 Samuel 13:12

But she answered him,  
“No, my brother! Do not violate me, for such a thing is not done in Israel;  
do not do this disgraceful sin!

## 2 Samuel 13:13

As for me, where could I bear my shame?  
And as for you, you will be like one of the fools in Israel.  
Now then, please speak to the king, for he will not refuse you.”

## 2 Samuel 13:14

However, he would not listen to her;  
since he was stronger than she, he overpowered her and lay with her.

## 2 Samuel 13:15

Then Amnon hated her with a very great hatred;  
for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her.  
So Amnon said to her, “Get up, go away!”

## 2 Samuel 13:16

But she said to him,  
“No, for this wrong in sending me away is even greater than what you have already done to me!”  
Yet he would not listen to her.

## 2 Samuel 13:17

Then he called his young man who attended him and said,  
“Now remove this woman from my presence, and lock the door behind her!”

## 2 Samuel 13:18

Now she was wearing a long-sleeved garment,  
for this is what the king’s virgin daughters wore previously.  
So his attendant took her out and locked the door behind her.

## 2 Samuel 13:19

Then Tamar put ashes on her head and tore the long-sleeved garment that was on her,  
and she put her hand on her head and went away, crying aloud as she went.

## 2 Samuel 13:20

And her brother Absalom said to her,  
“Has Amnon your brother been with you?  
But now, keep silent, my sister; he is your brother.  
Do not take this matter to heart.”  
So Tamar stayed and lived in her brother Absalom’s house, desolate.

## 2 Samuel 13:21

When King David heard about all these matters, he was filled with anger.

## 2 Samuel 13:22

Absalom did not speak with Amnon either good or bad;  
for Absalom harboured hatred towards Amnon because he had wronged his sister Tamar.

---

## 2 Samuel 13:23

Now it came about after two full years,  
that Absalom had shearers in Baal-hazor, which is near Ephraim,  
and Absalom invited all the king’s sons.

## 2 Samuel 13:24

Then Absalom came to the king and said,  
“Now behold, your servant has shearers;  
please let the king and his servants go with your servant.”

## 2 Samuel 13:25

But the king said to Absalom,  
“No, my son, we should not all go, so that we will not be a burden to you.”  
Although he urged him, he would not go; but he blessed him.

## 2 Samuel 13:26

Then Absalom said,  
“If not, please have my brother Amnon go with us.”  
And the king said to him, “Why should he go with you?”

## 2 Samuel 13:27

Nevertheless, Absalom persisted,  
so he allowed Amnon and all the king’s sons to go with him.

## 2 Samuel 13:28

Then Absalom commanded his servants, saying,  
“See now, when Amnon’s heart is joyful with wine,  
and when I say to you, ‘Strike Amnon,’ then put him to death.  
Do not fear; have I not myself commanded you? Be courageous and be valiant.”

## 2 Samuel 13:29

And the servants of Absalom acted upon his command concerning Amnon.  
Then all the king’s sons got up and each mounted his mule and fled.

---

## 2 Samuel 13:30

While they were on the way, a report reached David, saying,  
“Absalom has struck and killed all the king’s sons, and not one of them is left!”

## 2 Samuel 13:31

Then the king stood up, tore his clothes, and lay on the ground;  
and all his servants were standing by with their clothes torn.

## 2 Samuel 13:32

But Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother, responded,  
“Do not let my lord assume that they have put to death all the young men, the king’s sons;  
for only Amnon is dead, because Absalom has planned this since the day he wronged his sister Tamar.

## 2 Samuel 13:33

Now then, do not let my lord the king take the report to heart, namely,  
‘All the king’s sons are dead,’ for only Amnon is dead.”

## 2 Samuel 13:34

Now Absalom had fled.  
And the young man who was on watch raised his eyes and looked,  
and behold, many people were coming from the road behind him by the side of the mountain.

## 2 Samuel 13:35

Jonadab said to the king,  
“Behold, the king’s sons have come; in accordance with the word of your servant, so it happened.”

## 2 Samuel 13:36

As soon as he had finished speaking,  
behold, the king’s sons came and raised their voices and wept;  
and the king and all his servants also wept greatly.

---

## 2 Samuel 13:37

Meanwhile, Absalom had fled to Talmai the son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur.  
And David mourned for his son every day.

## 2 Samuel 13:38

So Absalom had fled and gone to Geshur, and he was there for three years.

## 2 Samuel 13:39

And King David's heart longed to go out to Absalom;  
for he found comfort regarding Amnon, since he was dead.
