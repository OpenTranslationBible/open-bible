# 2 Samuel Chapter 10

## 2 Samuel 10:1

Now it happened afterward that the king of the Ammonites died,  
and Hanun his son became king in his place.

## 2 Samuel 10:2

Then David said, “I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash,  
just as his father showed kindness to me.”  
So David sent his servants to console him concerning his father.  
But when David’s servants came to the land of the Ammonites,

## 2 Samuel 10:3

the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun their lord,  
“Do you think that David is honouring your father because he has sent consolers to you?  
Has David not sent his servants to you in order to explore the city, to spy it out and overthrow it?”

## 2 Samuel 10:4

So Hanun took David’s servants and shaved off half of their beards,  
and cut off their garments in the middle as far as their hips, and sent them away.

## 2 Samuel 10:5

When it was reported to David, he sent messengers to meet them,  
for the men were deeply humiliated.  
And the king said, “Stay in Jericho until your beards grow back, and then return.”

## 2 Samuel 10:6

When the Ammonites saw that they had become odious to David,  
the Ammonites sent and hired the Arameans of Beth-rehob and the Arameans of Zobah,  
twenty thousand foot soldiers,  
and the king of Maacah with a thousand men,  
and the men of Tob with twelve thousand men.

## 2 Samuel 10:7

Upon learning of this, David dispatched Joab and the entire army, the valiant warriors.

## 2 Samuel 10:8

The Ammonites came out and lined up for battle at the entrance of the city,  
while the Arameans of Zobah and Rehob and the men of Tob and Maacah were by themselves in the field.

## 2 Samuel 10:9

Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him in front and behind,  
he selected some of the best men of Israel and lined them up against the Arameans.

## 2 Samuel 10:10

Then he placed the rest of the people under the command of his brother Abishai,  
and he lined them up against the Ammonites.

## 2 Samuel 10:11

And he said, “If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you shall help me;  
but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, then I will come to help you.

## 2 Samuel 10:12

Be strong, and let us show ourselves courageous for the sake of our people and the cities of our God;  
and may the Lord do what is good in His sight.”

## 2 Samuel 10:13

So Joab and the people who were with him advanced to the battle against the Arameans,  
and they fled from him.

## 2 Samuel 10:14

When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans had fled, they also fled from Abishai and entered the city.  
Then Joab returned from fighting against the Ammonites and came to Jerusalem.

## 2 Samuel 10:15

When the Arameans saw that they had been defeated by Israel,  
they regrouped themselves.

## 2 Samuel 10:16

And Hadadezer sent word and brought out the Arameans who were beyond the Euphrates River,  
and they came to Helam;  
and Shobach the commander of Hadadezer’s army led them.

## 2 Samuel 10:17

When it was reported to David,  
he gathered all Israel together, crossed the Jordan, and came to Helam.  
And the Arameans lined up to confront David and fought against him.

## 2 Samuel 10:18

But the Arameans fled from Israel,  
and David killed seven hundred charioteers of the Arameans and forty thousand horsemen,  
and struck down Shobach the commander of their army, and he died there.

## 2 Samuel 10:19

When all the kings who were servants of Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel,  
they made peace with Israel and served them.  
So the Arameans were afraid to help the Ammonites anymore.
