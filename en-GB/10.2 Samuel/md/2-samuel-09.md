“Is there still anyone left of the house of Saul,  
so that I may show him kindness for Jonathan’s sake?”

and they summoned him to David.  
And the king said to him, “Are you Ziba?”  
And he said, “I am your servant.”

## 2 Samuel 9:3

Then the king said,  
“Is there no one remaining from the house of Saul  
to whom I may show the kindness of God?”  
And Ziba said to the king,  
“There is still a son of Jonathan,  
who is crippled in both feet.”

## 2 Samuel 9:4

So the king said to him, “Where is he?”  
And Ziba said to the king,  
“Behold, he is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar.”

Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David

And David said, “Mephibosheth!”  
And he said, “Here is your servant!”

## 2 Samuel 9:7

David said to him,  
“Do not be afraid, for I will assuredly show kindness to you  
for the sake of your father Jonathan,  
and I will restore to you all the land of your grandfather Saul;  
and you yourself shall eat at my table regularly.”

Then the king summoned Saul’s servant Ziba and said to him,  
“All that belonged to Saul and to all his house  
I have given to your master’s grandson.

## 2 Samuel 9:10

You and your sons and your servants shall cultivate the land for him,  
and you shall bring in the produce  
so that your master’s grandson may have food;  
nevertheless, Mephibosheth, your master’s grandson, shall eat at my table regularly.”  
Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.

## 2 Samuel 9:11

Then Ziba said to the king,  
“In accordance with all that my lord the king commands his servant, so your servant will do.”  
So Mephibosheth ate at David’s table, like one of the king’s sons.

Mephibosheth had a young son whose name was Mica.  
And all who lived in the house of Ziba were servants to Mephibosheth.

So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem,  
because he ate at the king’s table regularly.  
And he was lame in both feet.
