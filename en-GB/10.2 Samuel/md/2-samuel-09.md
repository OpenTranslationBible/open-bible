Then David said,  
“Is there still anyone left of the house of Saul,  
so that I may show him kindness for Jonathan’s sake?”

## 2 Samuel 9:2

There was a servant from Saul's household named Ziba,  
who was brought before David.  
The king asked him, “Are you Ziba?”  
And he replied, “I am your servant.”

## 2 Samuel 9:3

Then the king said,  
“Is there no one remaining from the house of Saul  
to whom I may show the kindness of God?”  
And Ziba said to the king,  
“There is still a son of Jonathan,  
who is crippled in both feet.”

## 2 Samuel 9:4

The king inquired, “Where is he?”  
And Ziba replied to the king,  
“He is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar.”

## 2 Samuel 9:5

Then King David sent messengers and brought him from the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar.

## 2 Samuel 9:6

Mephibosheth, Jonathan's son and Saul's grandson, came to David  
and bowed down, prostrating himself.  
And David said, “Mephibosheth!”  
And he answered, “Here is your servant!”

## 2 Samuel 9:7

David said to him,  
“Do not be afraid, for I will assuredly show kindness to you  
for the sake of your father Jonathan,  
and I will restore to you all the land of your grandfather Saul;  
and you yourself shall eat at my table regularly.”

## 2 Samuel 9:8

And he prostrated himself and said,  
“What is your servant, that you should regard a dead dog like me?”

The king then called for Ziba, Saul’s servant, and told him,  
“I have given to your master’s grandson all that belonged to Saul and his family.

## 2 Samuel 9:10

You, your sons, and your servants shall work the land for him,  
and bring in the harvest  
so that your master’s grandson may have food;  
however, Mephibosheth, your master’s grandson, shall eat at my table regularly.”  
Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.

## 2 Samuel 9:11

Then Ziba said to the king,  
“In accordance with all that my lord the king commands his servant, so your servant will do.”  
So Mephibosheth ate at David’s table, like one of the king’s sons.

## 2 Samuel 9:12

Mephibosheth had a young son named Mica.  
And all who lived in Ziba's household were servants to Mephibosheth.

## 2 Samuel 9:13

So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem,  
because he ate at the king’s table regularly.  
And he was lame in both feet.
