# 2 Samuel Chapter 15

## 2 Samuel 15:1

Now after this, Absalom provided for himself a chariot and horses,  
and fifty men to run before him.

## 2 Samuel 15:2

And Absalom would rise early and stand beside the road to the gate.  
Whenever any man had a suit to bring before the king for judgment,  
Absalom would call to him and say,  
“From what city are you?”  
And he would say, “Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel.”

## 2 Samuel 15:3

Then Absalom would say to him,  
“See, your claims are good and right,  
but there is no one appointed by the king to hear you.”

## 2 Samuel 15:4

And Absalom would say,  
“Oh that I were appointed judge in the land,  
then every man who had a case or cause would come to me,  
and I would give him justice.”

## 2 Samuel 15:5

And whenever a man approached to bow before him,  
he would reach out his hand, take hold of him, and kiss him.

## 2 Samuel 15:6

Absalom did this to all Israel who came to the king for judgment;  
so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.

## 2 Samuel 15:7

Now at the end of four years, Absalom said to the king,  
“Please let me go and pay my vow which I have made to the Lord in Hebron.

## 2 Samuel 15:8

For your servant made a vow while I was living at Geshur in Aram, saying,  
‘If the Lord will indeed bring me back to Jerusalem, then I will serve the Lord.’”

## 2 Samuel 15:9

And the king said to him, “Go in peace.”  
So he arose and went to Hebron.

## 2 Samuel 15:10

But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying,  
“As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet,  
then you shall say, ‘Absalom is king in Hebron!’”

## 2 Samuel 15:11

And two hundred men went with Absalom from Jerusalem, who had been invited;  
they went in innocence, knowing nothing.

## 2 Samuel 15:12

And while Absalom was offering the sacrifices,  
he sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counsellor, from his city Giloh.  
And the conspiracy grew strong,  
and the people with Absalom kept increasing.

## 2 Samuel 15:13

Then a messenger came to David, saying,  
“The hearts of the men of Israel are with Absalom.”

## 2 Samuel 15:14

So David said to all his servants who were with him in Jerusalem,  
“Arise, let us flee, for otherwise none of us will escape from Absalom.  
Go quickly, lest he overtake us suddenly and bring disaster upon us,  
and strike the city with the edge of the sword.”

## 2 Samuel 15:15

Then the king’s servants said to him,  
“Behold, your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king chooses.”

## 2 Samuel 15:16

So the king went out, and all his household with him.  
But the king left behind ten concubines to keep the house.

## 2 Samuel 15:17

And the king departed with all the people accompanying him, and they paused at the last house.

## 2 Samuel 15:18

Now all his servants passed by him,  
and all the Cherethites, all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites—six hundred men who had followed him from Gath—passed before the king.

## 2 Samuel 15:19

Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite,  
“Why do you also go with us? Return and stay with the king,  
for you are a foreigner and also an exile from your own place.

## 2 Samuel 15:20

You came only yesterday, and shall I today make you wander with us,  
since I do not even know where I am going?  
Return, and take back your brothers.  
Mercy and truth be with you.”

## 2 Samuel 15:21

But Ittai answered the king and said,  
“As the Lord lives, and as my lord the king lives,  
surely wherever my lord the king may be,  
whether for death or for life, there your servant will be.”

## 2 Samuel 15:22

So David said to Ittai,  
“Go on then, march.”  
So Ittai the Gittite passed by with all his men and the little ones who were with him.

## 2 Samuel 15:23

All the land wept aloud as all the people passed by.  
And the king crossed the brook Kidron,  
and all the people passed over toward the way of the wilderness.

## 2 Samuel 15:24

Behold, also Zadok came, and all the Levites with him,  
carrying the ark of the covenant of God.  
They set down the ark of God, and Abiathar came up  
until all the people had finished passing out of the city.

## 2 Samuel 15:25

Then the king said to Zadok,  
“Return the ark of God to the city.  
If I find favour in the eyes of the Lord, He will bring me back and let me see both it and His dwelling place.

## 2 Samuel 15:26

But if He should say thus, ‘I have no delight in you,’  
behold, here I am; let Him do to me what seems good to Him.”

## 2 Samuel 15:27

The king also said to Zadok the priest,  
“Are you not a seer? Return to the city in peace,  
and your two sons with you,  
Ahimaaz your son and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.

## 2 Samuel 15:28

See, I will wait at the fords of the wilderness  
until word comes from you to inform me.”

## 2 Samuel 15:29

So Zadok and Abiathar took the Ark of God back to Jerusalem and stayed there.

## 2 Samuel 15:30

And David went up the ascent of the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went.  
His head was covered and he walked barefoot.  
And all the people who were with him covered their heads and went up,  
weeping as they went.

## 2 Samuel 15:31

Then someone told David, saying,  
“Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.”  
And David said,  
“O Lord, please turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.”

## 2 Samuel 15:32

Now as David came to the summit where God was worshipped,  
behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his tunic torn and dust on his head.

## 2 Samuel 15:33

And David said to him,  
“If you pass over with me, you will be a burden to me.

## 2 Samuel 15:34

But if you return to the city and say to Absalom,  
‘I will be your servant, O king; as I have been your father’s servant in time past,  
so now I will be your servant,’  
then you can thwart the counsel of Ahithophel for me.

## 2 Samuel 15:35

Will not Zadok and Abiathar the priests be with you there?  
So whatever you hear from the king’s house, you shall report to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.

## 2 Samuel 15:36

Behold, their two sons are with them there, Ahimaaz, Zadok’s son,  
and Jonathan, Abiathar’s son;  
and by them you shall send to me everything you hear.”

## 2 Samuel 15:37

So Hushai, David’s friend, came into the city  
just as Absalom was entering Jerusalem.
