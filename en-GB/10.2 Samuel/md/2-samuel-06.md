# 2 Samuel Chapter 6

## 2 Samuel 6:1

David once more assembled all the selected men of Israel, thirty thousand.

## 2 Samuel 6:2

And David arose and went with all the people who were with him to Baale-judah,  
to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the Name,  
the name of the Lord of armies, who is enthroned above the cherubim.

## 2 Samuel 6:3

And they mounted the ark of God on a new cart,  
and brought it from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill;  
and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were leading the new cart.

## 2 Samuel 6:4

Thus they transported the ark of God from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill,  
with Ahio walking in front of the ark.

## 2 Samuel 6:5

At the same time, David and all the house of Israel were celebrating before the Lord  
with various instruments made of juniper wood, along with lyres, harps, tambourines, castanets, and cymbals.

## 2 Samuel 6:6

But as they reached the threshing floor of Nacon,  
Uzzah extended his hand toward the ark of God and took hold of it, for the oxen had stumbled.

## 2 Samuel 6:7

And the Lord's anger was kindled against Uzzah, and God struck him there for his irreverence;  
and he died there beside the ark of God.

## 2 Samuel 6:8

Then David was displeased because of the Lord’s outburst against Uzzah,  
and that place has been called Perez-uzzah to this day.

## 2 Samuel 6:9

David was filled with fear of the Lord that day;  
and he said, “How can the ark of the Lord come to me?”

## 2 Samuel 6:10

And David was unwilling to move the ark of the Lord to himself in the city of David;  
but David took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.

## 2 Samuel 6:11

So the ark of the Lord remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite for three months,  
and the Lord blessed Obed-edom and all his household.

## 2 Samuel 6:12

Now it was reported to King David, saying,  
“The Lord has blessed the house of Obed-edom and all that belongs to him, on account of the ark of God.”  
So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom to the city of David with joy.

## 2 Samuel 6:13

And so it was, that when those carrying the ark of the Lord had gone six paces,  
he sacrificed an ox and a fattened steer.

## 2 Samuel 6:14

And David was dancing before the Lord with all his strength,  
and he was wearing a linen ephod.

## 2 Samuel 6:15

So David and all the house of Israel were bringing up the ark of the Lord with joyful shouting  
and with the sound of the trumpet.

## 2 Samuel 6:16

Then it happened, as the ark of the Lord was coming into the city of David,  
that Michal the daughter of Saul looked down through the window  
and saw King David leaping and dancing before the Lord;  
and she despised him in her heart.

## 2 Samuel 6:17

Thus they placed the ark of the Lord in its designated spot inside the tent which David had set up for it,  
and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord.

## 2 Samuel 6:18

When David had completed the burnt offering and the peace offerings,  
he blessed the people in the name of the Lord of armies.

## 2 Samuel 6:19

And he distributed to all the people, to all the multitude of Israel, both men and women,  
a cake of bread, a portion of meat, and a raisin cake to each one.  
Then all the people departed, each to his house.

## 2 Samuel 6:20

But when David returned to bless his own household,  
Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David and said,  
“How the king of Israel distinguished himself today!  
He uncovered himself today in the sight of his servants’ female slaves,  
as one of the foolish ones shamelessly uncovers himself!”

## 2 Samuel 6:21

But David said to Michal,  
“It was before the Lord, who chose me above your father and above all his house,  
to appoint me ruler over the people of the Lord, over Israel;  
therefore I will celebrate before the Lord!

## 2 Samuel 6:22

And I might demean myself even more than this, and be humbled in my own eyes;  
but with the female slaves of whom you spoke, with them I shall be held in honour.”

## 2 Samuel 6:23

And Michal, the daughter of Saul, remained childless throughout her life.
