# 2 Samuel Chapter 24

## 2 Samuel 24:1

Now again the anger of the Lord burned against Israel,  
and He incited David against them, saying,  
“Go, take a census of Israel and Judah.”

## 2 Samuel 24:2

So the king said to Joab the commander of the army who was with him,  
“Go about now through all the tribes of Israel,  
from Dan to Beersheba, and count the people,  
so that I may know the number of the people.”

## 2 Samuel 24:3

But Joab said to the king,  
“May the Lord your God add to the people a hundred times as many as they are,  
while the eyes of my lord the king still see;  
but why does my lord the king delight in this thing?”

## 2 Samuel 24:4

Nevertheless, the king’s word prevailed against Joab and the commanders of the army.  
So Joab and the commanders of the army went out from the presence of the king  
to count the people of Israel.

## 2 Samuel 24:5

They crossed the Jordan and camped in Aroer,  
on the right side of the city that is in the centre of the Valley of Gad and toward Jazer.

## 2 Samuel 24:6

Then they came to Gilead and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi,  
and they came to Dan-jaan and circled around to Sidon.

## 2 Samuel 24:7

And they came to the fortress of Tyre and all the cities of the Hivites and of the Canaanites,  
and they went out to the south of Judah, to Beersheba.

## 2 Samuel 24:8

So after they had travelled through the entire land,  
they arrived in Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.

## 2 Samuel 24:9

And Joab gave the number of the census of the people to the king:  
in Israel there were eight hundred thousand men who drew the sword,  
and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.

## 2 Samuel 24:10

Now David’s heart troubled him after he had counted the people.  
So David said to the Lord,  
“I have sinned greatly in what I have done.  
But now, Lord, please forgive the guilt of Your servant,  
for I have acted very foolishly.”

## 2 Samuel 24:11

When David awoke in the morning,  
a message from the Lord came to the prophet Gad, David’s seer, saying,

## 2 Samuel 24:12

“Go and speak to David,  
‘This is what the Lord says: I am offering you three things;  
choose for yourself one of them, and I will do it to you.’”

## 2 Samuel 24:13

So Gad came to David and told him,  
“Shall seven years of famine come to you in your land?  
Or will you flee for three months before your enemies while they pursue you?  
Or shall there be three days of plague in your land?  
Now consider and see what answer I shall return to Him who sent me.”

## 2 Samuel 24:14

Then David said to Gad,  
“I am in great distress.  
Let us fall into the hand of the Lord,  
for His mercies are great;  
but do not let me fall into human hands.”

## 2 Samuel 24:15

So the Lord sent a plague upon Israel from the morning until the designated time,  
and seventy thousand men of the people from Dan to Beersheba perished.

## 2 Samuel 24:16

When the angel extended his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it,  
the Lord relented of the disaster,  
and said to the angel who destroyed the people,  
“It is enough! Now relax your hand!”  
And the angel of the Lord was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.

## 2 Samuel 24:17

Then David spoke to the Lord when he saw the angel who was striking down the people, and said,  
“Behold, it is I who have sinned, and it is I who have done wrong;  
but these sheep, what have they done?  
Please let Your hand be against me and my father’s house!”

---

## 2 Samuel 24:18

So Gad came to David that day and said to him,  
“Go up, build an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.”

## 2 Samuel 24:19

David went up in accordance with the word of Gad,  
just as the Lord had commanded.

## 2 Samuel 24:20

Araunah looked down and saw the king and his servants crossing over toward him,  
and he went out and bowed to the king with his face to the ground.

## 2 Samuel 24:21

Then Araunah said,  
“Why has my lord the king come to his servant?”  
David said,  
“To buy the threshing floor from you,  
to build an altar to the Lord,  
so that the plague may be halted from the people.”

## 2 Samuel 24:22

Araunah said to David,  
“Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him.  
Look, the oxen for the burnt offering,  
the threshing sledges, and the yokes of the oxen for the wood.

## 2 Samuel 24:23

All this, O king, Araunah freely gives to the king.”  
And Araunah said to the king,  
“May the Lord your God accept you.”

## 2 Samuel 24:24

However, the king said to Araunah,  
“No, but I will certainly buy it from you for a price;  
for I will not offer burnt offerings to the Lord my God that cost me nothing.”  
So David purchased the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.

## 2 Samuel 24:25

Then David built there an altar to the Lord,  
and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.  
And the Lord responded to prayer for the land,  
and the plague was withdrawn from Israel.
