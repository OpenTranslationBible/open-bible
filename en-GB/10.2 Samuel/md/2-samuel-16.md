# 2 Samuel Chapter 16

## 2 Samuel 16:1

Now when David had passed a little beyond the summit,  
Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him with a pair of saddled donkeys,  
and on them were two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred clusters of raisins,  
a hundred summer fruits, and a container of wine.

## 2 Samuel 16:2

The king said to Ziba,  
“What do you mean to do with these?”  
Ziba said, “The donkeys are for the king’s household to ride,  
the bread and summer fruit are for the young men to eat,  
and the wine is for whoever becomes weary in the wilderness to drink.”

## 2 Samuel 16:3

Then the king said,  
“And where is your master’s son?”  
Ziba said to the king,  
“Behold, he is staying in Jerusalem, for he said,  
‘Today the house of Israel will restore to me the kingdom of my father.’”

## 2 Samuel 16:4

So the king said to Ziba,  
“Behold, all that belonged to Mephibosheth is now yours.”  
And Ziba said, “I bow before you; may I find favour in your sight, my lord the king.”

## 2 Samuel 16:5

When King David came to Bahurim,  
behold, a man came out from there of the family of the house of Saul,  
whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera;  
he was coming out cursing continually as he came.

## 2 Samuel 16:6

He threw stones at David and at all the servants of King David,  
even though all the people and all the mighty men were at his right and left.

## 2 Samuel 16:7

Thus Shimei said when he cursed,  
“Get out, get out, you man of bloodshed, you worthless man!

## 2 Samuel 16:8

The Lord has returned upon you all the blood of the house of Saul,  
in whose place you have reigned.  
The Lord has given the kingdom into the hand of your son Absalom.  
Behold, you are caught in your own evil, for you are a man of bloodshed!”

## 2 Samuel 16:9

Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king,  
“Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king?  
Let me go over now and take off his head.”

## 2 Samuel 16:10

But the king said,  
“What have I to do with you, sons of Zeruiah?  
If he curses, and if the Lord has told him, ‘Curse David,’  
then who shall say, ‘Why have you done so?’”

## 2 Samuel 16:11

Then David said to Abishai and to all his servants,  
“Behold, my own son, who came from my body, seeks my life;  
how much more now this Benjaminite?  
Leave him alone and let him curse, for the Lord has told him.

## 2 Samuel 16:12

Perhaps the Lord will look on my affliction  
and return good to me instead of his cursing this day.”

## 2 Samuel 16:13

So David and his men went on the way,  
and Shimei went along on the hillside opposite him,  
cursing as he went, throwing stones at him, and flinging dust.

## 2 Samuel 16:14

And the king and all the people who were with him arrived weary,  
and he refreshed himself there.

## 2 Samuel 16:15

Now Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem,  
and Ahithophel was with him.

## 2 Samuel 16:16

Then Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, came to Absalom and said to him,  
“Long live the king! Long live the king!”

## 2 Samuel 16:17

But Absalom said to Hushai,  
“Is this your loyalty to your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?”

## 2 Samuel 16:18

Then Hushai said to Absalom,  
“No! For whomever the Lord, this people, and all the men of Israel choose,  
his I will be, and with him I will remain.

## 2 Samuel 16:19

Furthermore, whom should I serve?  
Should it not be his son?  
As I have served your father, so I will serve you.”

## 2 Samuel 16:20

Then Absalom said to Ahithophel,  
“Give your advice. What shall we do?”

## 2 Samuel 16:21

And Ahithophel said to Absalom,  
“Go in to your father’s concubines whom he left to keep the house;  
then all Israel will hear that you have made yourself odious to your father.  
Then the hands of all who are with you will be strengthened.”

## 2 Samuel 16:22

So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof,  
and Absalom went in to his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel.

## 2 Samuel 16:23

Now the advice of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days,  
was as if one inquired at the word of God.  
So was all the advice of Ahithophel, both with David and with Absalom.
