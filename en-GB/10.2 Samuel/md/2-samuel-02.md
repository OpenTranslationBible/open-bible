# 2 Samuel Chapter 2

## 2 Samuel 2:1

Afterward, David sought guidance from the Lord, asking,  
“Should I go up to one of the cities of Judah?”  
And the Lord replied, “Go up.”  
David then asked, “To which city shall I go?”  
And He answered, “To Hebron.”

## 2 Samuel 2:2

So David went up there, accompanied by his two wives: Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail, who had been the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.

## 2 Samuel 2:3

David also led his men who were with him, each with his household,  
and they settled in the towns of Hebron.

## 2 Samuel 2:4

Then the men of Judah came and anointed David as king over the house of Judah there.  
And they informed David, saying,  
“It was the men of Jabesh-gilead who buried Saul.”

## 2 Samuel 2:5

So David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead and said to them,  
“May you be blessed by the Lord for showing this kindness to Saul your lord and for burying him.

## 2 Samuel 2:6

And now may the Lord show kindness and truth to you,  
and I also will show you this goodness because you have done this thing.

## 2 Samuel 2:7

Now then, let your hands be strong and be valiant,  
for Saul your lord is dead,  
and the house of Judah has anointed me king over them.”

## 2 Samuel 2:8

However, Abner the son of Ner, commander of Saul’s army,  
had taken Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul, and brought him to Mahanaim.

## 2 Samuel 2:9

And he made him king over Gilead, over the Ashurites, over Jezreel, over Ephraim, over Benjamin,  
even over all Israel.

## 2 Samuel 2:10

Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, was forty years old when he became king over Israel,  
and he reigned for two years.  
Yet the house of Judah followed David.

## 2 Samuel 2:11

David reigned in Hebron over the house of Judah for seven years and six months.

## 2 Samuel 2:12

Abner, the son of Ner, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon  
with the servants of Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul.

## 2 Samuel 2:13

And Joab, the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David also went out and met them  
by the pool of Gibeon;  
and they sat down, one group on one side of the pool and the other group on the other side.

## 2 Samuel 2:14

Then Abner said to Joab,  
“Now let the young men arise and compete before us.”  
And Joab said, “Let them arise.”

## 2 Samuel 2:15

So they got up and came forward by count: twelve for Benjamin and Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul,  
and twelve from the servants of David.

## 2 Samuel 2:16

And each one seized his opponent by the head and thrust his sword in his opponent’s side;  
so they fell down together.  
Therefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which is in Gibeon.

## 2 Samuel 2:17

And the battle became very severe that day,  
and Abner and the men of Israel were defeated before the servants of David.

## 2 Samuel 2:18

Now the three sons of Zeruiah were there: Joab, Abishai, and Asahel.  
And Asahel was as swift-footed as one of the gazelles in the field.

## 2 Samuel 2:19

And Asahel pursued Abner and did not turn to the right or to the left from following him.

## 2 Samuel 2:20

Then Abner turned around and said,  
“Is that you, Asahel?”  
And he answered, “It is I.”

## 2 Samuel 2:21

So Abner said to him,  
“Turn aside to your right or to your left, and take hold of one of the young men for yourself, and take his armour.”  
But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.

## 2 Samuel 2:22

So Abner repeated again to Asahel,  
“Turn aside from following me.  
Why should I strike you to the ground?  
How then could I show my face to your brother Joab?”

## 2 Samuel 2:23

However, he refused to turn aside;  
so Abner struck him in the belly with the butt end of the spear,  
so that the spear came out at his back.  
And he fell there and died on the spot.  
And it happened that everyone who came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died stood still.

## 2 Samuel 2:24

But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner,  
and the sun was going down when they came to the hill of Ammah,  
which is in front of Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.

## 2 Samuel 2:25

And the sons of Benjamin gathered together behind Abner and became one band,  
and they stood on the top of a hill.

## 2 Samuel 2:26

Then Abner called to Joab and said,  
“Shall the sword devour forever?  
Do you not know that it will be bitter in the end?  
How long will you refrain from telling the people to stop pursuing their kinsmen?”

## 2 Samuel 2:27

Joab said, “As God lives, if you had not spoken, then the people would have only withdrawn in the morning,  
each from pursuing his brother.”

## 2 Samuel 2:28

So Joab blew the trumpet, and all the people halted and no longer pursued Israel,  
nor did they continue to fight.

---

## 2 Samuel 2:29

Then Abner and his men travelled through the Arabah all that night,  
crossed the Jordan, walked all morning, and came to Mahanaim.

## 2 Samuel 2:30

Then Joab returned from pursuing Abner,  
and when he had gathered all the people, nineteen of David’s servants were missing, besides Asahel.

## 2 Samuel 2:31

But David's servants had struck down many of Benjamin and Abner’s men,  
resulting in the death of three hundred and sixty men.

## 2 Samuel 2:32

And they picked up Asahel and buried him in his father’s tomb, which was in Bethlehem.  
Then Joab and his men travelled all night until the day dawned at Hebron.
