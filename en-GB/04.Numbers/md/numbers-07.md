# Numbers Chapter 7

## Numbers 7:1
When Moses finished setting up the tabernacle, he anointed and consecrated it and all its furnishings, the altar and its utensils.

## Numbers 7:2
Then the leaders of Israel, the heads of their ancestral tribes, brought their offerings. They were the leaders over the numbered divisions.

## Numbers 7:3
They brought six covered carts and twelve oxen—an ox from each leader and a cart for every two leaders—and presented them before the tabernacle.

## Numbers 7:4
The Lord said to Moses:

## Numbers 7:5
“Accept these from them for use in the work at the tent of meeting. Give them to the Levites, according to their duties.”

## Numbers 7:6
So Moses took the carts and oxen and gave them to the Levites.

## Numbers 7:7
He gave two carts and four oxen to the Gershonites, as their work required.

## Numbers 7:8
He gave four carts and eight oxen to the Merarites, as their work required. All was done under Ithamar son of Aaron.

## Numbers 7:9
But Moses did not give any to the Kohathites, since they were to carry the holy things on their shoulders.

## Numbers 7:10
The leaders also brought offerings for the dedication of the altar when it was anointed.

## Numbers 7:11
The Lord said to Moses: “Have one leader bring his offering each day for the dedication.”

## Numbers 7:84
These were the offerings of the Israelite leaders for the dedication of the altar when it was anointed: twelve silver plates, twelve silver bowls, and twelve gold dishes.

## Numbers 7:85
Each silver plate weighed 130 shekels and each bowl 70 shekels—all according to the sanctuary shekel. The total weight of silver was 2,400 shekels.

## Numbers 7:86
The twelve gold dishes filled with incense weighed 120 shekels in total.

## Numbers 7:87
The total of burnt offerings was twelve bulls, twelve rams, and twelve male lambs, along with grain offerings.

## Numbers 7:88
The total of fellowship offerings was twenty-four oxen, sixty rams, sixty male goats, and sixty lambs.

## Numbers 7:89
When Moses entered the tent of meeting to speak with the Lord, he heard the voice speaking to him from between the cherubim above the ark of the covenant law.
