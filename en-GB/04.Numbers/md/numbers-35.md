# Numbers Chapter 35

## Numbers 35:1
On the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho, the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

## Numbers 35:2
“Command the Israelites to give the Levites towns to live in from among the inheritance they possess. Also give the Levites surrounding pastureland for their livestock.

## Numbers 35:3
These towns will be theirs to live in, and the surrounding fields are for their animals.

## Numbers 35:4
The pastureland around the towns shall extend a thousand cubits from the town wall in all directions.

## Numbers 35:5
Measure two thousand cubits outside the town on each side—east, south, west, and north—with the town in the center. This will be their grazing area.

## Numbers 35:6
Among the towns you give the Levites, six are to be designated as cities of refuge, where someone who kills another unintentionally may flee. In addition, give them forty-two more towns.

## Numbers 35:7
In total, you are to give the Levites forty-eight towns, along with their surrounding pasturelands.

## Numbers 35:8
The towns are to be taken from the larger tribes in greater number, and fewer from the smaller tribes, according to the inheritance each tribe receives.

## Numbers 35:9
Then the Lord said to Moses:

## Numbers 35:10
“Speak to the Israelites and say: When you cross the Jordan into Canaan,

## Numbers 35:11
select some towns to serve as cities of refuge, to which anyone who kills a person accidentally may flee.

## Numbers 35:12
They will serve as places of safety from the avenger of blood, so that the killer may not die before standing trial before the assembly.

## Numbers 35:13
You must designate six cities of refuge.

## Numbers 35:14
Three must be located on the east side of the Jordan and three in Canaan proper.

## Numbers 35:15
These six cities are for Israelites, foreigners, and temporary residents alike. Anyone who kills another unintentionally may flee there.

## Numbers 35:16
But if someone strikes another with an iron object so that the person dies, they are a murderer. The murderer must be put to death.

## Numbers 35:17
If they strike another with a stone capable of causing death, and the person dies, they are guilty.

## Numbers 35:18
If they strike with a wooden object that could kill, and the victim dies, the assailant is a murderer and must be executed.

## Numbers 35:19
The avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death upon encountering them.

## Numbers 35:20
If someone pushes another out of hatred or throws something at them with malicious intent, and the victim dies,

## Numbers 35:21
or if they strike them with a hostile hand and the person dies, it is murder. The killer must be executed by the avenger of blood.

## Numbers 35:22
But if someone pushes another accidentally, without hostility, or throws something unintentionally,

## Numbers 35:23
or drops a stone without seeing the person, and the person dies though not an enemy nor intended target,

## Numbers 35:24
then the assembly must judge between the killer and the avenger of blood based on these laws.

## Numbers 35:25
If the assembly determines it was unintentional, they must protect the killer and send them back to the city of refuge.

## Numbers 35:26
If the killer ever leaves the city of refuge before the death of the high priest,

## Numbers 35:27
and the avenger of blood finds and kills them outside the city, the avenger is not guilty.

## Numbers 35:28
The killer must stay in the city of refuge until the high priest dies; only then may they return home.

## Numbers 35:29
These are legal requirements for all generations to come.

## Numbers 35:30
Anyone convicted of murder must be executed based on the testimony of witnesses. No one is to be executed on the testimony of a single witness.

## Numbers 35:31
You must not accept a ransom for the life of a murderer condemned to die—they must be put to death.

## Numbers 35:32
Do not accept payment to allow someone to flee a city of refuge and return home before the death of the high priest.

## Numbers 35:33
Do not defile the land where you are. Bloodshed defiles the land, and no atonement can be made for it except by the blood of the one who shed it.

## Numbers 35:34
Do not pollute the land where you dwell, for I, the Lord, dwell among the Israelites.
