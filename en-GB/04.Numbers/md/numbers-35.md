# Numbers Chapter 35

## Numbers 35:1
The Lord spoke to Moses on the plains of Moab by the Jordan, opposite Jericho, saying,

## Numbers 35:2
“Instruct the Israelites to allocate to the Levites towns to reside in from the inheritance of their possessions. Also, provide them with pasturelands surrounding these towns.

## Numbers 35:3
These towns will be for them to live in, and the pasturelands will be for their cattle, their equipment, and all their other animals.

## Numbers 35:4
“The pasturelands around the towns you give to the Levites shall extend outward a thousand cubits from the town wall.

## Numbers 35:5
Measure two thousand cubits outside the town on the east, south, west, and north sides, with the town in the centre. This area will serve as pastureland for the towns.

## Numbers 35:6
“Of the towns you give to the Levites, designate six as cities of refuge, where someone who has committed manslaughter may flee. In addition, provide forty-two other towns.

## Numbers 35:7
In total, you must allocate forty-eight towns to the Levites, along with their pasturelands.

## Numbers 35:8
The towns you allocate to the Levites from the Israelites' land should be proportional to the inheritance of each tribe: take more towns from a tribe with a larger inheritance, and fewer from one with a smaller inheritance.”

## Numbers 35:9
The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying,

## Numbers 35:10
“Tell the Israelites: ‘When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan,

## Numbers 35:11
select towns to serve as cities of refuge, where someone who has killed another unintentionally may flee.

## Numbers 35:12
These cities will be a refuge from the avenger, so that the accused may not die before standing trial before the assembly.

## Numbers 35:13
The six towns you provide will be your cities of refuge.

## Numbers 35:14
Allocate three cities on this side of the Jordan and three in the land of Canaan as cities of refuge.

## Numbers 35:15
These six cities will be a refuge for the Israelites, strangers, and foreigners residing among you, so that anyone who has killed another unintentionally may flee there.

## Numbers 35:16
“‘If someone strikes another with an iron object causing death, that person is a murderer; the murderer must be put to death.

## Numbers 35:17
If someone strikes another with a stone in the hand, causing death, that person is a murderer; the murderer must be put to death.

## Numbers 35:18
Or if someone strikes another with a wooden object in the hand, causing death, that person is a murderer; the murderer must be put to death.

## Numbers 35:19
The avenger of blood is to execute the murderer; when the avenger encounters the murderer, the avenger shall put the murderer to death.

## Numbers 35:20
If someone pushes another out of hatred, or throws something at them with malicious intent, resulting in death,

## Numbers 35:21
or if someone strikes another with hostility, causing death, the perpetrator is a murderer and must be put to death. The avenger of blood shall execute the murderer when they meet.

## Numbers 35:22
“‘However, if someone pushes another suddenly without hostility, or throws any object at them without malicious intent,

## Numbers 35:23
or, without seeing them, drops a stone heavy enough to cause death, and the person dies, but there was no enmity and no harm intended,

## Numbers 35:24
then the assembly shall judge between the accused and the avenger of blood according to these laws.

## Numbers 35:25
The assembly must protect the one accused of manslaughter from the avenger of blood and return the accused to the city of refuge to which they fled. The accused must remain there until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil.

## Numbers 35:26
“‘If the accused ever leaves the boundaries of the city of refuge to which they fled,

## Numbers 35:27
and the avenger of blood finds them outside the city, the avenger may kill the accused without being guilty of murder.

## Numbers 35:28
The accused must remain in the city of refuge until the death of the high priest; only after the death of the high priest may they return to their property.

## Numbers 35:29
“‘These regulations are to be a legal statute for you throughout your generations, wherever you live.

## Numbers 35:30
“‘Anyone who kills another shall be put to death as a murderer only on the testimony of witnesses. No one is to be put to death on the testimony of just one witness.

## Numbers 35:31
“‘Do not accept a ransom for the life of a murderer who deserves to die. They must be put to death.

## Numbers 35:32
“‘Do not accept a ransom for anyone who has fled to a city of refuge, allowing them to return and live on their own land before the death of the high priest.

## Numbers 35:33
“‘Do not defile the land where you reside. Bloodshed defiles the land, and no atonement can be made for the land on which blood has been shed, except by the blood of the one who shed it.

## Numbers 35:34
Do not defile the land where you dwell, where I also dwell, for I, the Lord, dwell among the Israelites.’”
