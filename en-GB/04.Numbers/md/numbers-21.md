# Numbers Chapter 21

## Numbers 21:1
When the Canaanite king of Arad, who resided in the Negev, heard that Israel was approaching by the route of Atharim, he engaged in battle against Israel and took some of them captive.

## Numbers 21:2
Then Israel vowed to the Lord, saying, “If you will indeed deliver this people into our hands, we will utterly destroy their cities.”

## Numbers 21:3
The Lord heeded Israel’s plea and handed the Canaanites over to them. They completely destroyed them and their towns, and the place was named Hormah.

## Numbers 21:4
They journeyed from Mount Hor by the way of the Red Sea, to circumvent the land of Edom; but the people became impatient along the way.

## Numbers 21:5
The people spoke against God and Moses, saying, “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to perish in the wilderness? There is no bread, there is no water, and we loathe this wretched food!”

## Numbers 21:6
Then the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people, so that many Israelites died.

## Numbers 21:7
The people came to Moses and said, “We have sinned by speaking against the Lord and against you; pray to the Lord to remove the serpents from us.” So Moses prayed for the people.

## Numbers 21:8
The Lord instructed Moses, “Make a fiery serpent and set it on a pole; anyone who is bitten and looks at it will live.”

## Numbers 21:9
So Moses fashioned a bronze serpent and placed it on a pole; whenever a serpent bit someone, and that person looked at the bronze serpent, they survived.

## Numbers 21:10
The Israelites moved on and encamped at Oboth.

## Numbers 21:11
They set out from Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim, in the wilderness facing Moab toward the east.

## Numbers 21:12
From there they continued and camped in the Zered Valley.

## Numbers 21:13
They set out from there and camped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness extending into Amorite territory; for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.

## Numbers 21:14
This is why it is mentioned in the Book of the Wars of the Lord: “Waheb in Suphah, and the wadis of the Arnon,

## Numbers 21:15
and the slopes of the wadis that extend to the site of Ar and lie along the border of Moab.”

## Numbers 21:16
From there they continued to Beer, the well where the Lord said to Moses, “Gather the people together and I will give them water.”

## Numbers 21:17
Then Israel sang this song: “Spring up, O well! Sing to it!

## Numbers 21:18
The well, which the leaders dug, which the nobles of the people hollowed out with sceptres and staffs.” Then they went from the wilderness to Mattanah,

## Numbers 21:19
from Mattanah to Nahaliel, from Nahaliel to Bamoth,

## Numbers 21:20
and from Bamoth to the valley in the land of Moab, at the top of Pisgah, which overlooks the wasteland.

## Numbers 21:21
Israel sent envoys to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,

## Numbers 21:22
“Let us pass through your land. We will not turn aside into field or vineyard, nor drink water from any well. We will travel along the King’s Highway until we have passed through your territory.”

## Numbers 21:23
But Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his territory. Instead, he mustered all his people and went out against Israel in the wilderness, and came to Jahaz and fought against Israel.

## Numbers 21:24
Israel struck him with the edge of the sword and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far as the Ammonites, for the border of the Ammonites was fortified.

## Numbers 21:25
Israel captured all the cities of the Amorites and settled in them, including Heshbon and all its surrounding settlements.

## Numbers 21:26
Heshbon was the city of Sihon king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and had taken all his land from him as far as the Arnon.

## Numbers 21:27
Therefore those who speak in proverbs say, “Come to Heshbon and let it be rebuilt; let the city of Sihon be restored.

## Numbers 21:28
For fire went out from Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon; it consumed Ar of Moab, the lords of Arnon’s heights.

## Numbers 21:29
Woe to you, Moab! You are ruined, people of Chemosh! He has given his sons as fugitives and his daughters into captivity to Sihon king of the Amorites.

## Numbers 21:30
But we have shot them down; Heshbon is destroyed as far as Dibon, and we have laid waste as far as Nophah, which reaches to Medeba.”

## Numbers 21:31
Thus Israel settled in the land of the Amorites.

## Numbers 21:32
Moses sent spies to Jazer, and they captured its surrounding settlements and drove out the Amorites who were there.

## Numbers 21:33
Then they turned and went up by the way of Bashan, and Og king of Bashan, along with all his people, came out to meet them in battle at Edrei.

## Numbers 21:34
But the Lord said to Moses, “Do not be afraid of him, for I have delivered him into your hands, along with all his people and his land. Do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon.”

## Numbers 21:35
So they struck him down, along with his sons and his whole army, leaving no survivors, and they took possession of his land.
