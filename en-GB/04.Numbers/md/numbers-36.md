# Numbers Chapter 36

## Numbers 36:1
The heads of the families from the clan of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh—a family of Joseph’s descendants—approached Moses and the leaders, the heads of the Israelite tribes.

## Numbers 36:2
They said, “The Lord commanded you to give land as an inheritance by lot to the Israelites. You were also told by the Lord to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters.

## Numbers 36:3
But if they marry men from another tribe, their inheritance will be taken from our ancestral land and added to that of the tribe they join.

## Numbers 36:4
When the Year of Jubilee comes, their land will be transferred permanently, reducing our own inheritance.”

## Numbers 36:5
Then Moses gave a command to the Israelites according to the word of the Lord: “The tribe of the descendants of Joseph is right.

## Numbers 36:6
This is what the Lord commands for Zelophehad’s daughters: They may marry anyone they please, as long as it is within their own tribal clan.

## Numbers 36:7
No inheritance in Israel may pass from tribe to tribe. Each Israelite must retain the land of their ancestral tribe.

## Numbers 36:8
Every daughter who inherits land must marry someone from her father’s tribe, so that all Israelites will keep their ancestral holdings.

## Numbers 36:9
No inheritance may pass from one tribe to another. Each tribe must keep the land it originally received.”

## Numbers 36:10
So Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milkah, and Noah—the daughters of Zelophehad—did as the Lord commanded Moses.

## Numbers 36:11
They married cousins on their father’s side, men from within the clans of Manasseh son of Joseph, so that their inheritance remained in their father’s tribe.

## Numbers 36:12
These were the commandments and laws the Lord gave the Israelites through Moses on the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho.
