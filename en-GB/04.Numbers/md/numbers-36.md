# Numbers Chapter 36

## Numbers 36:1

Now the heads of the fathers’ households of the family of the sons of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, from the families of the sons of Joseph, came forward and spoke before Moses and before the leaders, the heads of the fathers’ households of the sons of Israel.

## Numbers 36:2

And they said, “The Lord commanded my lord to give the land as an inheritance by lot to the sons of Israel, and my lord was commanded by the Lord to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters.

## Numbers 36:3

But if they marry one of the sons of the other tribes of the sons of Israel, then their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers, and it will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they belong; so it will be taken away from our allotted inheritance.

## Numbers 36:4

And when the jubilee of the sons of Israel comes, then their inheritance will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they belong; so their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.”

## Numbers 36:5

Then Moses commanded the sons of Israel in accordance with the word of the Lord, saying, “The tribe of the sons of Joseph is right in its statements.

## Numbers 36:6

This is what the Lord has commanded regarding the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, ‘Let them marry whomever they wish; only they must marry within the family of the tribe of their father.’

## Numbers 36:7

So no inheritance of the sons of Israel shall be transferred from tribe to tribe, for the sons of Israel shall each retain possession of the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.

## Numbers 36:8

And every daughter who comes into possession of an inheritance from any of the tribes of the sons of Israel shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father, so that the sons of Israel each may possess the inheritance of his fathers.

## Numbers 36:9

So no inheritance shall be transferred from one tribe to another tribe, for the tribes of the sons of Israel shall each retain possession of its own inheritance.”

## Numbers 36:10

Just as the Lord had commanded Moses, so the daughters of Zelophehad did:

## Numbers 36:11

Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, married their uncles’ sons.

## Numbers 36:12

They married those from the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained with the tribe of the family of their father.

## Numbers 36:13

These are the commandments and the ordinances which the Lord commanded the sons of Israel through Moses in the plains of Moab, by the Jordan opposite Jericho.
