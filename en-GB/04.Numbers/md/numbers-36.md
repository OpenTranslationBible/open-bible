# Numbers Chapter 36

## Numbers 36:1
The heads of the fathers' households of the family of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, from the families of the descendants of Joseph, approached and spoke before Moses and the leaders, the heads of the Israelite families.

## Numbers 36:2
They said, “The Lord instructed my lord to allocate the land to the Israelites as an inheritance by lot, and my lord was directed by the Lord to assign the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters.

## Numbers 36:3
But if they marry men from other Israelite tribes, their inheritance will be removed from our ancestral inheritance and added to the tribe into which they marry, thereby diminishing our allotted inheritance.

## Numbers 36:4
When the Year of Jubilee for the Israelites arrives, their inheritance will be added to the tribe into which they marry, and their property will be withdrawn from our ancestral tribe's inheritance.”

## Numbers 36:5
Moses then conveyed the Lord’s command to the Israelites, saying, “The tribe of the descendants of Joseph is correct in its assertions.

## Numbers 36:6
This is what the Lord commands concerning the daughters of Zelophehad: They may marry anyone they wish, provided they marry within their father's tribal family.

## Numbers 36:7
Thus, no inheritance in Israel shall be transferred from tribe to tribe, for each Israelite shall maintain the inheritance of their ancestral tribe.

## Numbers 36:8
Every daughter who inherits land in any Israelite tribe must marry someone from her father's tribal family, so that each Israelite may retain the inheritance of their ancestors.

## Numbers 36:9
No inheritance may be transferred from one tribe to another, for each Israelite tribe is to keep its own inheritance.”

## Numbers 36:10
The daughters of Zelophehad acted as the Lord had commanded Moses.

## Numbers 36:11
Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, married their cousins on their father's side.

## Numbers 36:12
They married into the families of the descendants of Manasseh, son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained within their father's tribe and family.

## Numbers 36:13
These are the commands and regulations the Lord gave to the Israelites through Moses on the plains of Moab by the Jordan, opposite Jericho.
