# Numbers Chapter 6

## Numbers 6:1
The Lord spoke again to Moses, saying,

## Numbers 6:2
“Speak to the Israelites and tell them: ‘When a man or woman makes a special vow, the vow of a Nazirite, to dedicate themselves to the Lord,

## Numbers 6:3
they must abstain from wine and strong drink; they shall not drink vinegar made from wine or strong drink, nor shall they consume grape juice or eat fresh or dried grapes.

## Numbers 6:4
Throughout the period of their vow, they must not eat anything that comes from the grapevine, not even the seeds or skins.

## Numbers 6:5
“‘For the entire duration of their Nazirite vow, no razor shall touch their head. They shall be holy until the time of their dedication to the Lord is completed; they shall let their hair grow long.

## Numbers 6:6
“‘During the period of their dedication to the Lord, the Nazirite must not go near a dead person.

## Numbers 6:7
They must not make themselves unclean for their father, mother, brother, or sister when they die, because the symbol of their consecration to God is upon their head.

## Numbers 6:8
Throughout their period of dedication, they are holy to the Lord.

## Numbers 6:9
“‘If someone dies suddenly beside them, defiling their consecrated head of hair, they must shave their head on the seventh day, the day of their cleansing.

## Numbers 6:10
On the eighth day, they shall bring two turtle doves or two young pigeons to the priest at the entrance of the tent of meeting.

## Numbers 6:11
The priest shall offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to make atonement for them because they sinned by being in the presence of the dead person. On that same day, they shall reconsecrate their head.

## Numbers 6:12
They must rededicate themselves to the Lord for the full period of their vow and bring a year-old male lamb as a guilt offering. The previous days do not count, as their consecration was defiled.

## Numbers 6:13
“‘This is the law of the Nazirite when the period of their dedication is completed: They shall be brought to the entrance of the tent of meeting.

## Numbers 6:14
There they shall present their offerings to the Lord: a year-old male lamb without defect for a burnt offering, a year-old ewe lamb without defect for a sin offering, and a ram without defect for a peace offering,

## Numbers 6:15
along with a basket of unleavened bread made of fine flour mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil, together with their grain and drink offerings.

## Numbers 6:16
“‘The priest shall present these before the Lord and offer the sin offering and the burnt offering.

## Numbers 6:17
He shall also offer the ram as a sacrifice of peace offerings to the Lord, together with the basket of unleavened bread; the priest shall also present the grain offering and drink offering.

## Numbers 6:18
“‘The Nazirite must then shave off their consecrated hair at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and place the hair on the fire under the sacrifice of the peace offerings.

## Numbers 6:19
“‘After the Nazirite has shaved off their consecrated hair, the priest is to place in their hands a boiled shoulder of the ram, one unleavened loaf, and one unleavened wafer from the basket.

## Numbers 6:20
The priest shall then wave them as a wave offering before the Lord; they are holy and belong to the priest, along with the breast that is waved and the thigh that is presented. After this, the Nazirite may drink wine.

## Numbers 6:21
“‘This is the law of the Nazirite who vows offerings to the Lord according to their dedication, in addition to whatever else they can afford. They must fulfil the vow they have made, according to the law of their consecration.’”

## Numbers 6:22
The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,

## Numbers 6:23
“Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying, ‘This is how you are to bless the Israelites. Say to them:

## Numbers 6:24
“‘“The Lord bless you and keep you;

## Numbers 6:25
may the Lord let His face shine upon you and show you His favor;

## Numbers 6:26
may the Lord look upon you with kindness and grant you peace.”’

## Numbers 6:27
“So they shall put My name on the Israelites, and I will bless them.”
