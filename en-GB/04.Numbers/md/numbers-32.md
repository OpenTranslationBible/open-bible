# Numbers Chapter 32

## Numbers 32:1

The descendants of Reuben and Gad, possessing a significant number of livestock, observed that the regions of Jazer and Gilead were well-suited for their animals.

## Numbers 32:2

Thus, they approached Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the leaders of the community, declaring,

## Numbers 32:3

“Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon—

## Numbers 32:4

the land which the Lord subdued before the assembly of Israel—is ideal for livestock, and your servants own livestock.”

## Numbers 32:5

They continued, “If we have found favour in your sight, allow this land to be granted to your servants as our possession; do not compel us to cross the Jordan.”

## Numbers 32:6

Moses responded to the sons of Gad and Reuben, “Shall your brethren go to war while you remain here?

## Numbers 32:7

Why do you dishearten the Israelites from crossing into the land that the Lord has provided them?

## Numbers 32:8

This is the same action your fathers took when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to survey the land.

## Numbers 32:9

Upon reaching the Valley of Eshcol and viewing the land, they discouraged the Israelites from entering the land which the Lord had promised them.

## Numbers 32:10

Consequently, the Lord’s anger was kindled that day, and He swore, saying,

## Numbers 32:11

‘None of the men who came up from Egypt, from twenty years old and above, will see the land I pledged to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, because they did not follow Me fully,

## Numbers 32:12

except Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun, for they have fully followed the Lord.’

## Numbers 32:13

Thus, the Lord’s wrath burned against Israel, causing them to wander the wilderness for forty years, until the entire generation that had done evil in the Lord’s sight had perished.

## Numbers 32:14

And now, you have risen in your fathers’ stead, a brood of sinful men, to further inflame the Lord’s anger against Israel.

## Numbers 32:15

If you turn away from following Him, He will again leave them in the wilderness, and you will be responsible for their destruction.”

## Numbers 32:16

They then approached him and said, “We wish to construct pens here for our livestock and cities for our little ones;

## Numbers 32:17

but we will arm ourselves swiftly, leading the Israelites, until we have brought them to their place, while our little ones reside in fortified cities for protection against the inhabitants of the land.

## Numbers 32:18

We will not return to our homes until every one of the Israelites has received his inheritance.

## Numbers 32:19

We will not claim any inheritance with them beyond the Jordan, as our inheritance has been allocated to us on this side of the Jordan towards the east.”

## Numbers 32:20

Moses replied, “If you will do this—if you will arm yourselves for battle before the Lord,

## Numbers 32:21

and if all your armed men cross over the Jordan before the Lord until He has driven out His enemies from before Him—

## Numbers 32:22

then, once the land is subdued before the Lord, you may return and be free from your obligation to the Lord and Israel, and this land shall be your possession before the Lord.

## Numbers 32:23

But if you do not do this, you will have sinned against the Lord, and be sure your sin will find you out.

## Numbers 32:24

Construct cities for your little ones and pens for your flocks, and fulfil what you have promised.”

## Numbers 32:25

The sons of Gad and Reuben replied to Moses, “Your servants will do as our lord commands.

## Numbers 32:26

Our little ones, wives, flocks, and all our cattle will remain in the cities of Gilead,

## Numbers 32:27

while your servants, every man armed for battle, will cross over in the presence of the Lord to engage in battle, just as our lord has said.”

## Numbers 32:28

So Moses gave instructions concerning them to Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers’ households of the Israelite tribes.

## Numbers 32:29

Moses instructed them, “If the sons of Gad and Reuben, every man armed for battle, cross over the Jordan with you before the Lord, and the land is subdued before you, then you shall grant them the land of Gilead as their possession.

## Numbers 32:30

But if they do not cross over with you armed, they must accept their inheritance among you in Canaan.”

## Numbers 32:31

The sons of Gad and Reuben answered, “As the Lord has spoken to your servants, so we will do.

## Numbers 32:32

We will cross over armed in the presence of the Lord into Canaan, but the property of our inheritance shall remain with us on this side of the Jordan.”

## Numbers 32:33

So Moses assigned to the sons of Gad, the sons of Reuben, and the half-tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan—the land with its cities and the surrounding territories.

## Numbers 32:34

The descendants of Gad constructed Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer,

## Numbers 32:35

Atroth-shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah,

## Numbers 32:36

Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran as fortified cities, and pens for their flocks.

## Numbers 32:37

The sons of Reuben rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh, and Kiriathaim,

## Numbers 32:38

as well as Nebo and Baal-meon (their names being changed) and Sibmah. They gave new names to the cities they rebuilt.

## Numbers 32:39

The descendants of Machir son of Manasseh went to Gilead, captured it, and expelled the Amorites who were there.

## Numbers 32:40

Therefore, Moses granted Gilead to Machir son of Manasseh, and he settled there.

## Numbers 32:41

Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, captured their settlements and named them Havvoth-jair.

## Numbers 32:42

Nobah went and captured Kenath and its surrounding villages, naming it Nobah after himself.
