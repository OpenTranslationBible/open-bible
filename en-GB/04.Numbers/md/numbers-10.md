# Numbers Chapter 10

## Numbers 10:1

The Lord then spoke to Moses, saying:

## Numbers 10:2

“Craft two trumpets of hammered silver for yourself; use them for summoning the congregation and for breaking camp.

## Numbers 10:3

When both trumpets are blown, the whole assembly shall gather before you at the entrance of the tent of meeting.

## Numbers 10:4

If only one trumpet is blown, then the leaders, the heads of the clans of Israel, shall assemble before you.

## Numbers 10:5

When an alarm is sounded, the camps stationed on the east side shall set out.

## Numbers 10:6

When an alarm is sounded a second time, the camps on the south side shall set out. An alarm is to be sounded for them to break camp.

## Numbers 10:7

To convene the assembly, blow the trumpets, but do not sound an alarm.

## Numbers 10:8

The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets. This shall be a lasting ordinance for you throughout your generations.

## Numbers 10:9

When you go to war in your land against an enemy who oppresses you, sound an alarm with the trumpets. Then you will be remembered by the Lord your God and be rescued from your enemies.

## Numbers 10:10

On your days of rejoicing, your appointed festivals, and at the beginning of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, and they shall be a memorial before your God. I am the Lord your God.”

## Numbers 10:11

On the twentieth day of the second month in the second year, the cloud lifted from above the tabernacle of the covenant law.

Moses said to Hobab son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law, “We are setting out to the place which the Lord has promised to give us. Come with us and we will treat you well, for the Lord has promised good things to Israel.”

## Numbers 10:30

He replied, “I will not go; I am returning to my own land and my own people.”

## Numbers 10:31

Moses urged, “Please do not leave us. You know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you can be our guide.

## Numbers 10:32

If you come with us, we will share with you whatever good things the Lord grants us.”

## Numbers 10:33

So they set out from the mountain of the Lord and travelled for three days. The ark of the covenant of the Lord went ahead of them during those three days to find a resting place for them.

## Numbers 10:34

The cloud of the Lord was over them by day when they set out from the camp.

## Numbers 10:35

Whenever the ark set out, Moses said, “Rise up, Lord! May your enemies be scattered and your foes flee before you.”

## Numbers 10:36

Whenever it came to rest, he said, “Return, Lord, to the many thousands of Israel.”
