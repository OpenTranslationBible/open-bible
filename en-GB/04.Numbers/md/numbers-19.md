# Numbers Chapter 19

## Numbers 19:1
The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:

## Numbers 19:2
“This is the statute of the law that the Lord has commanded: Speak to the Israelites that they bring you a red heifer without defect or blemish, one that has never been yoked.

## Numbers 19:3
You shall give it to Eleazar the priest, and it shall be taken outside the camp and slaughtered in his sight.

## Numbers 19:4
Eleazar the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger and sprinkle it seven times towards the front of the tent of meeting.

## Numbers 19:5
The heifer shall then be burned in his presence; its hide, flesh, blood, and offal shall all be consumed by fire.

## Numbers 19:6
The priest shall take cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet wool, and throw them into the midst of the burning heifer.

## Numbers 19:7
Afterwards, the priest shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and then he may come into the camp; however, he will remain ceremonially unclean until evening.

## Numbers 19:8
The one who burns the heifer shall also wash his clothes and bathe in water, and he will be unclean until evening.

## Numbers 19:9
A man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and place them in a clean area outside the camp. They shall be kept by the Israelite community for use in the water of purification; it is for cleansing from sin.

## Numbers 19:10
The man who gathers the ashes must wash his clothes, and he will be unclean until evening. This shall be a lasting ordinance for the Israelites and the foreigners residing among them.

## Numbers 19:11
Whoever touches a human corpse will be unclean for seven days.

## Numbers 19:12
They must cleanse themselves with the water on the third day and on the seventh day; then they will be clean. If they do not purify themselves on the third and seventh days, they will not be clean.

## Numbers 19:13
Anyone who touches a dead body and does not purify themselves defiles the Lord’s tabernacle. They must be cut off from Israel, as the water of purification has not been sprinkled on them; they remain unclean.

## Numbers 19:14
This is the law when a person dies in a tent: anyone who enters the tent and anyone who is in it will be unclean for seven days.

## Numbers 19:15
Every open container without a lid fastened on it will be unclean.

## Numbers 19:16
Anyone in the open field who touches someone killed by a sword or who has died naturally, or touches a human bone or a grave, will be unclean for seven days.

## Numbers 19:17
For the unclean person, take some of the ashes from the burnt purification offering and add running water to them in a container.

## Numbers 19:18
A clean person shall take hyssop, dip it in the water, and sprinkle it on the tent, all the furnishings, and the people who were there. He must also sprinkle anyone who has touched a bone, a grave, or someone who was killed or died naturally.

## Numbers 19:19
The clean person shall sprinkle the unclean on the third and seventh days, and on the seventh day he shall purify them. They must wash their clothes and bathe in water, and by evening they will be clean.

## Numbers 19:20
But if the unclean person does not purify themselves, they must be cut off from the assembly, for they have defiled the sanctuary of the Lord. The water of purification has not been sprinkled on them, and they are unclean.

## Numbers 19:21
This shall be a lasting ordinance for them. The one who sprinkles the water of purification must wash his clothes, and anyone who touches the water of purification will be unclean until evening.

## Numbers 19:22
Anything that an unclean person touches becomes unclean, and anyone who touches it will be unclean until evening.”
