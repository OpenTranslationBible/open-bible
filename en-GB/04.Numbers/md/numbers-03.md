# Numbers Chapter 3

## Numbers 3:1
These are the records of the family of Aaron and Moses at the time when the Lord spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai.

## Numbers 3:2
Aaron's sons were Nadab, the firstborn, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

## Numbers 3:3
These were the names of Aaron’s sons, the anointed priests, who were ordained to serve as priests.

## Numbers 3:4
However, Nadab and Abihu died in the presence of the Lord when they offered unauthorised fire before Him in the wilderness of Sinai; and they had no sons. So Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests during the lifetime of their father Aaron.

## Numbers 3:5
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,

## Numbers 3:6
“Bring the tribe of Levi forward and present them before Aaron the priest, that they may assist him.

## Numbers 3:7
They shall perform duties for him and for the whole congregation at the tent of meeting, by doing the work of the tabernacle.

## Numbers 3:8
They are responsible for all the furnishings of the tent of meeting, fulfilling the obligations of the Israelites by managing the work of the tabernacle.

## Numbers 3:9
Assign the Levites to Aaron and his sons; they are exclusively given to him from among the Israelites.

## Numbers 3:10
Appoint Aaron and his sons to serve as priests; but the layman who approaches the sanctuary shall be put to death.”

## Numbers 3:11
The Lord again spoke to Moses, saying,

## Numbers 3:12
“Behold, I have taken the Levites from among the Israelites in place of every firstborn, the firstborn of the womb among the sons of Israel. The Levites shall be Mine,

## Numbers 3:13
for all the firstborn are Mine. On the day I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I sanctified to Myself all the firstborn in Israel, both human and animal. They shall be Mine; I am the Lord.”

## Numbers 3:14
Then the Lord spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,

## Numbers 3:15
“Count the sons of Levi by their families and clans; every male from a month old and upward you shall count.”

## Numbers 3:16
So Moses numbered them according to the word of the Lord, just as he had been instructed.

## Numbers 3:17
These are the sons of Levi by their names: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

## Numbers 3:18
These are the sons of Gershon by their families: Libni and Shimei.

## Numbers 3:19
The descendants of Kohath by their families included Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.

## Numbers 3:20
The sons of Merari by their families were Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their fathers’ households.

## Numbers 3:21
From Gershon came the families of the Libnites and the Shimeites; these were the families of the Gershonites.

## Numbers 3:22
Their numbered men, in the counting of every male from a month old and upward, were 7,500.

## Numbers 3:23
The Gershonite families were to set up their camp westward, behind the tabernacle.

## Numbers 3:24
The leader of the fathers’ households of the Gershonites was Eliasaph the son of Lael.

## Numbers 3:25
The duties of the sons of Gershon in the tent of meeting included the tabernacle and the tent, its covering, and the curtain for the entrance of the tent of meeting,

## Numbers 3:26
and the curtains of the courtyard, the curtain for the entrance of the courtyard surrounding the tabernacle and the altar, and its ropes, according to all the service concerning them.

## Numbers 3:27
From Kohath came the families of the Amramites, the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the Uzzielites; these were the families of the Kohathites.

## Numbers 3:28
In the counting of every male from a month old and upward, there were 8,600, responsible for the duties of the sanctuary.

## Numbers 3:29
The families of Kohath's descendants were to camp on the southern side of the tabernacle.

## Numbers 3:30
The leader of the fathers’ households of the Kohathite families was Elizaphan the son of Uzziel.

## Numbers 3:31
Their duties included the ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, the utensils of the sanctuary with which they minister, the curtain, and all the service concerning them.

## Numbers 3:32
Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, was the head of the leaders of Levi, overseeing those who performed the duties of the sanctuary.

## Numbers 3:33
From Merari came the families of the Mahlites and the Mushites; these were the families of Merari.

## Numbers 3:34
Their numbered men in the counting of every male from a month old and upward were 6,200.

## Numbers 3:35
The leader of the fathers’ households of the families of Merari was Zuriel the son of Abihail. They were to camp on the north side of the tabernacle.

## Numbers 3:36
The duties assigned to the sons of Merari included the framework of the tabernacle, its bars, its pillars, its bases, all its equipment, and all the service concerning them,

## Numbers 3:37
and the pillars around the courtyard with their bases, their pegs, and their cords.

## Numbers 3:38
Those who were to camp in front of the tabernacle eastward, in front of the tent of meeting toward the sunrise, were Moses and Aaron and his sons, performing the duties of the sanctuary for the obligation of the sons of Israel; but the layman coming near was to be put to death.

## Numbers 3:39
All the numbered men of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron counted at the command of the Lord by their families, every male from a month old and upward, were 22,000.

## Numbers 3:40
Then the Lord instructed Moses, “Count every firstborn male of the sons of Israel from a month old and upward, and make a list of their names.

## Numbers 3:41
And you shall take the Levites for Me—I am the Lord—in exchange for all the firstborn among the sons of Israel; and the cattle of the Levites in substitution for all the firstborn among the cattle of the sons of Israel.”

## Numbers 3:42
So Moses counted all the firstborn among the sons of Israel, just as the Lord had instructed him.

## Numbers 3:43
And all the firstborn males, by the number of names from a month old and upward, were 22,273.

## Numbers 3:44
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,

## Numbers 3:45
“Take the Levites in substitution for all the firstborn among the sons of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites in place of their cattle. And the Levites shall be Mine; I am the Lord.

## Numbers 3:46
And as a redemption price for the 273 of the firstborn of the sons of Israel who exceed the number of the Levites,

## Numbers 3:47
you shall collect five shekels for each individual; you shall take them according to the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel is twenty gerahs),

## Numbers 3:48
and you shall hand over the money, the redemption price of those who are in excess among them, to Aaron and to his sons.”

## Numbers 3:49
So Moses collected the redemption money from those who exceeded the number of those redeemed by the Levites;

## Numbers 3:50
from the firstborn of the sons of Israel he collected the money in terms of the shekel of the sanctuary, 1,365.

## Numbers 3:51
Then Moses gave the redemption money to Aaron and to his sons, at the command of the Lord, just as the Lord had instructed Moses.
