# Numbers Chapter 24

## Numbers 24:1

Now when Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord to bless Israel, he did not seek omens as before, but turned his face toward the wilderness.

## Numbers 24:2

When Balaam looked out and saw Israel encamped tribe by tribe, the Spirit of God came on him.

## Numbers 24:3

And he delivered this oracle:

> “The prophecy of Balaam son of Beor,  
> the prophecy of one whose eyes see clearly,

## Numbers 24:4

> the prophecy of one who hears the words of God,  
> who sees a vision from the Almighty,  
> who falls prostrate, and whose eyes are opened:

## Numbers 24:5

> How beautiful are your tents, Jacob,  
> your dwellings, Israel!

## Numbers 24:6

> Like valleys they spread out,  
> like gardens beside a river,  
> like aloes planted by the Lord,  
> like cedars beside the waters.

## Numbers 24:7

> Water will flow from their buckets;  
> their seed will have abundant water.  
> Their king will be greater than Agag;  
> their kingdom will be exalted.

## Numbers 24:8

> God brought them out of Egypt;  
> they have the strength of a wild ox.  
> They devour hostile nations,  
> breaking their bones in pieces and piercing them with arrows.

## Numbers 24:9

> They crouch and lie down like a lion,  
> like a lioness—who dares to rouse them?  
> Blessed are those who bless you,  
> and cursed are those who curse you.”

## Numbers 24:10

Then Balak’s anger burned against Balaam. He struck his hands together and said, “I summoned you to curse my enemies, but you have blessed them three times!

## Numbers 24:11

Now leave at once and go home! I promised to reward you handsomely, but the Lord has kept you from being rewarded.”

## Numbers 24:12

Balaam answered, “Did I not tell the messengers you sent me:

## Numbers 24:13

‘Even if Balak gave me all the silver and gold in his palace, I could not go beyond the command of the Lord’?

## Numbers 24:14

Now I am going back to my people, but let me tell you what this people will do to yours in days to come.”

## Numbers 24:15

Then Balaam delivered his fourth oracle:

> “The prophecy of Balaam son of Beor,  
> the prophecy of one whose eyes see clearly,

## Numbers 24:16

> the prophecy of one who hears the words of God,  
> who has knowledge from the Most High,  
> who sees a vision from the Almighty,  
> who falls prostrate, and whose eyes are opened:

## Numbers 24:17

> I see him, but not now;  
> I behold him, but not near.  
> A star will come out of Jacob;  
> a sceptre will rise out of Israel.

> He will crush the foreheads of Moab,  
> the skulls of all the people of Sheth.

## Numbers 24:18

> Edom will be conquered; Seir, his enemy, will be conquered,  
> but Israel will grow strong.

## Numbers 24:19

> A ruler will come out of Jacob  
> he will ensure there are no survivors of the city.”

## Numbers 24:20

Then Balaam saw Amalek and spoke his message:

> “Amalek was first among the nations,  
> but their end will be utter destruction.”

## Numbers 24:21

Then he saw the Kenites and spoke his message:

> “Your dwelling place is secure,  
> your nest is set in a rock;

## Numbers 24:22

> yet you Kenites will be destroyed  
> when Ashur takes you captive.”

## Numbers 24:23

Then he spoke again:

> “Alas! Who can live when God does this?

## Numbers 24:24

> Ships will come from the coasts of Cyprus;  
> they will subdue Ashur and Eber,  
> but they too will come to ruin.”

## Numbers 24:25

Then Balaam got up and returned home, and Balak went his own way.
