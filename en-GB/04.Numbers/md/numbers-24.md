# Numbers Chapter 24

## Numbers 24:1
When Balaam realised that it pleased the Lord to bless Israel, he did not seek omens as he had done before, but turned his gaze towards the wilderness.

## Numbers 24:2
And Balaam lifted his eyes and saw Israel camped tribe by tribe, and the Spirit of God came upon him.

## Numbers 24:3
He began his oracle and said, “The utterance of Balaam son of Beor, the utterance of the man whose eye is open;

## Numbers 24:4
The utterance of one who hears the words of God, who sees the vision of the Almighty, who falls down, with eyes uncovered:

## Numbers 24:5
How lovely are your tents, Jacob, your dwelling places, Israel!

## Numbers 24:6
Like valleys they extend, like gardens beside a river, like aloes planted by the Lord, like cedars beside the waters.

## Numbers 24:7
Water shall flow from his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters; his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.

## Numbers 24:8
God brings him out of Egypt; he has the strength of a wild ox. He will consume the nations that are his enemies, and will break their bones and pierce them with his arrows.

## Numbers 24:9
He crouches, he lies down like a lion, and like a lioness—who dares to rouse him? Blessed are those who bless you, and cursed are those who curse you.”

## Numbers 24:10
Then Balak’s anger burned against Balaam, and he clapped his hands together and said to Balaam, “I called you to curse my enemies, but you have blessed them these three times!

## Numbers 24:11
Therefore, flee to your place now! I said I would greatly reward you, but the Lord has kept you from being honoured.”

## Numbers 24:12
Balaam replied to Balak, “Did I not tell your messengers whom you sent to me,

## Numbers 24:13
‘Even if Balak gave me his palace full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the command of the Lord to do either good or bad of my own will. What the Lord speaks, that I will speak’?

## Numbers 24:14
Now, behold, I am going back to my people; come, let me inform you of what this people will do to your people in the days to come.”

## Numbers 24:15
Then he began his oracle and said, “The utterance of Balaam son of Beor, the utterance of the man whose eye is open,

## Numbers 24:16
The utterance of one who hears the words of God, and has knowledge from the Most High, who sees the vision of the Almighty, who falls down, with eyes uncovered:

## Numbers 24:17
I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not near; a star shall come out of Jacob, a sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall crush the foreheads of Moab, and destroy all the sons of Sheth.

## Numbers 24:18
Edom shall be a possession; Seir, its enemies, shall also be a possession, while Israel grows strong.

## Numbers 24:19
A ruler shall come out of Jacob, and shall destroy the survivors of the city.”

## Numbers 24:20
Then he looked at Amalek and began his oracle and said, “Amalek was the first among the nations, but his end shall be utter destruction.”

## Numbers 24:21
And he looked at the Kenites and began his oracle and said, “Your dwelling place is secure, and your nest is set in the rock;

## Numbers 24:22
Nevertheless, the Kenites will be destroyed when Asshur takes you captive.”

## Numbers 24:23
Then he began his oracle and said, “Alas! Who can survive unless God has willed it?

## Numbers 24:24
But ships shall come from the coast of Kittim, and they shall afflict Asshur and afflict Eber; and they too shall come to destruction.”

## Numbers 24:25
Then Balaam arose and returned to his place, and Balak also went his own way.
