# Numbers Chapter 31

## Numbers 31:1
The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,

## Numbers 31:2
“Seek justice on the Midianites for the children of Israel; afterward you will be gathered to your people.”

## Numbers 31:3
Moses addressed the people, “Arm some of your men for the war, so that they may go against Midian to execute the Lord’s vengeance.

## Numbers 31:4
You shall send a thousand from each tribe of all the tribes of Israel to the battle.”

## Numbers 31:5
So there were selected from the thousands of Israel, a thousand from each tribe, twelve thousand armed for battle.

## Numbers 31:6
Moses sent them to the war, a thousand from each tribe, along with Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest, who took with him the holy articles and the trumpets for sounding the alarm.

## Numbers 31:7
They waged war against Midian, as the Lord commanded Moses, and killed every male.

## Numbers 31:8
They killed the kings of Midian, Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian. They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword.

## Numbers 31:9
The Israelites captured the women of Midian and their little ones, and they plundered all their cattle, flocks, and goods.

## Numbers 31:10
They burned all the towns where they lived and all their encampments.

## Numbers 31:11
They took all the plunder and all the spoils, both of people and livestock,

## Numbers 31:12
and brought the captives, spoils, and plunder to Moses, to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the Israelites at the camp on the plains of Moab, by the Jordan opposite Jericho.

## Numbers 31:13
Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the congregation went out to meet them outside the camp.

## Numbers 31:14
Moses was angry with the officers of the army, the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds, who had returned from the war.

## Numbers 31:15
He said to them, “Have you spared all the women?

## Numbers 31:16
Behold, they were the ones who, on Balaam’s advice, caused the Israelites to be unfaithful to the Lord at Peor, so that a plague struck the Lord’s people.

## Numbers 31:17
Now therefore, put to death every male among the little ones, and every woman who has known a man intimately.

## Numbers 31:18
But all the girls who have not known a man intimately, keep alive for yourselves.

## Numbers 31:19
Camp outside the camp for seven days; whoever has killed a person and whoever has touched anyone killed must purify yourselves and your captives on the third and seventh days.

## Numbers 31:20
Purify every garment, every article of leather, everything made of goats’ hair, and every article of wood.”

## Numbers 31:21
Then Eleazar the priest said to the soldiers who had gone to battle, “This is the statute of the law which the Lord commanded Moses:

## Numbers 31:22
The metals such as gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, and lead,

## Numbers 31:23
everything that can withstand fire, you shall pass through the fire, and it will be clean. It must also be purified with the water of cleansing. But whatever cannot withstand fire must be passed through the water.

## Numbers 31:24
Wash your clothes on the seventh day, and you will be clean; afterward you may enter the camp.”

## Numbers 31:25
The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,

## Numbers 31:26
“You and Eleazar the priest and the heads of the fathers’ households of the congregation are to take a count of the spoils that were captured, both of people and of livestock;

## Numbers 31:27
and divide the spoils between the warriors who went to battle and the rest of the congregation.

## Numbers 31:28
Collect a tribute for the Lord from the men of war who went to battle, one in five hundred of the persons, cattle, donkeys, and sheep;

## Numbers 31:29
take it from their half and give it to Eleazar the priest as an offering to the Lord.

## Numbers 31:30
From the Israelites’ half, take one out of every fifty of the persons, cattle, donkeys, sheep, and other animals, and give them to the Levites who perform the duty of the tabernacle of the Lord.”

## Numbers 31:31
Moses and Eleazar the priest carried out the Lord’s instructions to Moses.

## Numbers 31:32
The spoils remaining from the plunder which the men of war had taken were 675,000 sheep,

## Numbers 31:33
72,000 cattle,

## Numbers 31:34
61,000 donkeys,

## Numbers 31:35
and 32,000 women who had not known a man intimately.

## Numbers 31:36
The half share of those who went to war was: 337,500 sheep,

## Numbers 31:37
from which the Lord’s tribute was 675;

## Numbers 31:38
36,000 cattle, from which the Lord’s tribute was 72;

## Numbers 31:39
30,500 donkeys, from which the Lord’s tribute was 61;

## Numbers 31:40
16,000 people, from whom the Lord’s tribute was 32.

## Numbers 31:41
Moses gave the tribute, which was the Lord’s offering, to Eleazar the priest, following the Lord’s command to Moses.

## Numbers 31:42
As for the Israelites’ half, which Moses separated from the men who had gone to war—

## Numbers 31:43
the congregation’s half was 337,500 sheep,

## Numbers 31:44
36,000 cattle,

## Numbers 31:45
30,500 donkeys,

## Numbers 31:46
and 16,000 people.

## Numbers 31:47
From the Israelites’ half, Moses took one out of every fifty, both of people and animals, and gave them to the Levites who perform the duty of the tabernacle of the Lord, as the Lord commanded Moses.

## Numbers 31:48
Then the officers who were over the units of the army, the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds, approached Moses,

## Numbers 31:49
and said to him, “Your servants have counted the soldiers under our command, and none is missing.

## Numbers 31:50
So we have brought as an offering to the Lord what each man found, articles of gold—armlets, bracelets, signet rings, earrings, and necklaces—to make atonement for ourselves before the Lord.”

## Numbers 31:51
Moses and Eleazar the priest accepted from them the gold, all the crafted articles.

## Numbers 31:52
All the gold of the offering that they offered to the Lord, from the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, weighed 16,750 shekels.

## Numbers 31:53
Each soldier had taken his own share of plunder.

## Numbers 31:54
Moses and Eleazar the priest accepted the gold from the commanders of thousands and of hundreds and brought it to the tent of meeting as a memorial for the Israelites before the Lord.
