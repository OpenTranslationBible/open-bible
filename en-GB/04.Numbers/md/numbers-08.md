# Numbers Chapter 8

## Numbers 8:1
The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,

## Numbers 8:2
“Speak to Aaron and instruct him, ‘When you arrange the lamps, ensure that all seven illuminate the area in front of the lampstand.’”

## Numbers 8:3
Aaron complied; he arranged the lamps to face forward on the lampstand, just as the Lord had instructed Moses.

## Numbers 8:4
This is the craftsmanship of the lampstand: it was crafted from hammered gold, from its base to its decorative blossoms. It was made according to the pattern the Lord had shown Moses.

## Numbers 8:5
The Lord spoke to Moses again, saying,

## Numbers 8:6
“Select the Levites from among the Israelites and purify them.

## Numbers 8:7
To cleanse them, do the following: sprinkle them with purifying water, have them shave their entire bodies with a razor, and wash their clothes. Thus they will purify themselves.

## Numbers 8:8
Have them take a bull with its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil; and take a second bull for a sin offering.

## Numbers 8:9
Bring the Levites to the front of the tent of meeting and gather the entire Israelite community.

## Numbers 8:10
Present the Levites before the Lord, and the Israelites shall lay their hands on the Levites.

## Numbers 8:11
Aaron shall present the Levites before the Lord as a wave offering from the Israelites, so that they may be ready to perform the service of the Lord.

## Numbers 8:12
The Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls; then offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to the Lord, to make atonement for the Levites.

## Numbers 8:13
Have the Levites stand before Aaron and his sons and present them as a wave offering to the Lord.

## Numbers 8:14
In this manner, you shall set the Levites apart from the other Israelites, and the Levites shall be mine.

## Numbers 8:15
After you have purified the Levites and presented them as a wave offering, they may come to serve at the tent of meeting.

## Numbers 8:16
They are given entirely to me from among the Israelites. I have taken them for myself instead of the firstborn of every womb, the firstborn of all the Israelites.

## Numbers 8:17
For every firstborn in Israel, both human and animal, is mine. On the day I struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, I set them apart for myself.

## Numbers 8:18
I have taken the Levites instead of every firstborn among the Israelites.

## Numbers 8:19
I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and his sons from among the Israelites, to perform the service at the tent of meeting on behalf of the Israelites and to make atonement for them, so that no affliction will come upon the Israelites when they approach the sanctuary.”

## Numbers 8:20
Moses, Aaron, and the entire Israelite community did with the Levites just as the Lord commanded Moses.

## Numbers 8:21
The Levites purified themselves and washed their clothes. Aaron presented them as a wave offering before the Lord and made atonement for them to cleanse them.

## Numbers 8:22
Afterwards, the Levites went in to perform their duties at the tent of meeting under the supervision of Aaron and his sons. They did with the Levites just as the Lord commanded Moses.

## Numbers 8:23
The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,

## Numbers 8:24
“This is what applies to the Levites: from twenty-five years old and upwards, they shall enter to perform service in the work of the tent of meeting.

## Numbers 8:25
But at the age of fifty, they shall retire from regular service and work no longer.

## Numbers 8:26
They may assist their brothers in fulfilling their duties at the tent of meeting, but they shall not perform the work themselves. This is how you shall assign the responsibilities of the Levites.”
