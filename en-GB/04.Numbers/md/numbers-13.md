# Numbers Chapter 13

## Numbers 13:1
The Lord said to Moses,

## Numbers 13:2
“Send some men to explore the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the Israelites. Send one leader from each ancestral tribe.”

## Numbers 13:3
At the Lord’s command, Moses sent them from the Desert of Paran. All of them were leaders among the Israelites.

## Numbers 13:4
These are their names: from Reuben, Shammua son of Zakkur;

## Numbers 13:5
from Simeon, Shaphat son of Hori;

## Numbers 13:6
from Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh;

## Numbers 13:7
from Issachar, Igal son of Joseph;

## Numbers 13:8
from Ephraim, Hoshea son of Nun;

## Numbers 13:9
from Benjamin, Palti son of Raphu;

## Numbers 13:10
from Zebulun, Gaddiel son of Sodi;

## Numbers 13:11
from Manasseh, Gaddi son of Susi;

## Numbers 13:12
from Dan, Ammiel son of Gemalli;

## Numbers 13:13
from Asher, Sethur son of Michael;

## Numbers 13:14
from Naphtali, Nahbi son of Vophsi;

## Numbers 13:15
from Gad, Geuel son of Maki.

## Numbers 13:16
These were the names of the men Moses sent to explore the land. Moses gave Hoshea son of Nun the name Joshua.

## Numbers 13:17
When Moses sent them to explore Canaan, he said, “Go up through the Negev and into the hill country.

## Numbers 13:18
See what the land is like and whether the people who live there are strong or weak, few or many.

## Numbers 13:19
What kind of land do they live in? Is it good or bad? What are the towns like? Are they unwalled or fortified?

## Numbers 13:20
How is the soil? Are there trees? Do your best to bring back some of the fruit of the land.” (It was the season for the first ripe grapes.)

## Numbers 13:21
So they went up and explored the land from the Desert of Zin as far as Rehob.

## Numbers 13:22
They went up through the Negev and came to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai—the descendants of Anak—lived.

## Numbers 13:23
At the Valley of Eshcol they cut off a branch with a single cluster of grapes. It took two men to carry it. They also brought some pomegranates and figs.

## Numbers 13:24
That place was called the Valley of Eshcol because of the cluster of grapes the Israelites cut there.

## Numbers 13:25
At the end of forty days they returned from exploring the land.

## Numbers 13:26
They came back to Moses, Aaron, and the whole Israelite community at Kadesh and reported to them and showed them the fruit.

## Numbers 13:27
They said, “We went into the land to which you sent us, and it does flow with milk and honey! Here is its fruit.

## Numbers 13:28
But the people who live there are powerful, and the cities are large and fortified. We even saw descendants of Anak there.

## Numbers 13:29
The Amalekites live in the Negev; the Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites in the hills; and the Canaanites near the sea and along the Jordan.”

## Numbers 13:30
Then Caleb silenced the people before Moses and said, “We should go up and take possession of the land, for we can certainly do it.”

## Numbers 13:31
But the men who had gone with him said, “We cannot attack those people; they are stronger than we are.”

## Numbers 13:32
And they spread a bad report among the Israelites: “The land devours those living in it. All the people we saw are of great size.

## Numbers 13:33
We saw the Nephilim there. We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and we looked the same to them.”
