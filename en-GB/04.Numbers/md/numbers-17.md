# Numbers Chapter 17

## Numbers 17:1
The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,

## Numbers 17:2
“Speak to the Israelites and take one staff from each of the ancestral tribes, twelve staffs in total, one from each leader. Write the name of each man on his staff.

## Numbers 17:3
On the staff of Levi, write Aaron’s name, for there must be one staff for the head of each ancestral house.

## Numbers 17:4
Place them in the tent of meeting in front of the ark of the covenant, where I meet with you.

## Numbers 17:5
The staff belonging to the man I choose will sprout. This will put an end to the murmuring the Israelites make against you.”

## Numbers 17:6
So Moses spoke to the Israelites, and their leaders gave him twelve staffs, one from each of the tribal leaders. Aaron’s staff was among them.

## Numbers 17:7
Moses placed the staffs before the Lord in the tent of the covenant.

## Numbers 17:8
The next day Moses entered the tent and saw that Aaron’s staff, representing the tribe of Levi, had not only sprouted but had budded, blossomed, and produced ripe almonds.

## Numbers 17:9
Then Moses brought out all the staffs from before the Lord to all the Israelites. They looked at them, and each man took his own staff.

## Numbers 17:10
The Lord said to Moses, “Put Aaron’s staff back in front of the ark of the covenant law to be kept as a sign against the rebellious. This will put an end to their complaining so that they do not die.”

## Numbers 17:11
Moses did just as the Lord commanded him.

## Numbers 17:12
The Israelites said to Moses, “Look, we are perishing! We are lost, we are all lost!

## Numbers 17:13
Everyone who even comes near the tabernacle of the Lord dies. Are we all to die?”
