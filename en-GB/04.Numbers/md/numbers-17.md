# Numbers Chapter 17

## Numbers 17:1
The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,

## Numbers 17:2
“Speak to the Israelites and collect from them a staff for each ancestral tribe: twelve staffs, one from each leader of their ancestral tribes. Inscribe each man's name on his staff.

## Numbers 17:3
On the staff of Levi, write Aaron’s name, for there must be one staff for the head of each ancestral tribe.

## Numbers 17:4
Place them in the tent of meeting before the testimony, where I meet with you.

## Numbers 17:5
The staff belonging to the man whom I choose will sprout, and this will put an end to the grumblings of the Israelites against you.”

## Numbers 17:6
Moses spoke to the Israelites, and their leaders handed him twelve staffs, one for each leader of their ancestral tribes, including Aaron’s staff.

## Numbers 17:7
Moses placed the staffs before the Lord in the tent of the testimony.

## Numbers 17:8
The following day, Moses entered the tent and saw that Aaron’s staff, representing the tribe of Levi, had sprouted, blossomed, and produced almonds.

## Numbers 17:9
Moses then brought out all the staffs from the Lord’s presence to all the Israelites. They examined them, and each leader took back his own staff.

## Numbers 17:10
The Lord instructed Moses, “Return Aaron’s staff in front of the testimony, to be kept as a sign against the rebellious, so that their grumblings against Me may cease and they do not die.”

## Numbers 17:11
Moses did exactly as the Lord commanded him.

## Numbers 17:12
The Israelites said to Moses, “We are doomed! We are perishing, we are all perishing!

## Numbers 17:13
Anyone who approaches the tabernacle of the Lord will die. Are we all to perish completely?”
