“Instruct the Israelites: ‘When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan,

## Numbers 33:52

you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, destroy all their carved images, destroy all their cast idols, and demolish all their high places.

## Numbers 33:53

You shall own the land and make it your home, for I have granted you the land to dwell in.

## Numbers 33:54

You shall distribute the land by lot according to your clans. To a larger group give a larger inheritance, and to a smaller group a smaller one. Whatever falls to them by lot will be theirs. You shall distribute it according to your ancestral tribes.

## Numbers 33:55

But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, those you allow to remain will become barbs in your eyes and thorns in your sides, and they will trouble you in the land where you will live.

## Numbers 33:56

And what I plan to do to them, I will do to you.’”
