“Speak to the Israelites and say: When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan,

## Numbers 33:52
you must drive out all the inhabitants of the land before you. Destroy all their carved images and molten idols, and demolish all their high places.

## Numbers 33:53
Take possession of the land and settle in it, for I have given it to you as your inheritance.

## Numbers 33:54
Distribute the land by lot according to your clans. Give a larger inheritance to a larger group, and a smaller portion to a smaller group.

## Numbers 33:55
But if you do not drive out the inhabitants, those you allow to remain will become thorns in your sides and trouble you in the land where you live.

## Numbers 33:56
Then I will do to you what I had planned to do to them.”
