# Numbers Chapter 23

## Numbers 23:1
Balaam instructed Balak, “Construct seven altars for me here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me.”

## Numbers 23:2
Balak complied with Balaam's instructions, and together they sacrificed a bull and a ram on each altar.

## Numbers 23:3
Balaam then said to Balak, “Remain by your offering while I go. Perhaps the Lord will meet with me, and whatever He reveals, I will convey to you.” So he went to a desolate hill.

## Numbers 23:4
God encountered Balaam, and Balaam said, “I have erected seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each.”

## Numbers 23:5
The Lord placed a word in Balaam’s mouth and instructed, “Return to Balak and deliver this message.”

## Numbers 23:6
Balaam returned to Balak, who was standing beside his offering with all the Moabite leaders.

## Numbers 23:7
Balaam began his oracle: “Balak brought me from Aram, Moab's king from the eastern mountains, saying, ‘Come, curse Jacob for me; come, denounce Israel.’

## Numbers 23:8
How can I speak against those whom God has not spoken against? How can I oppose those whom the Lord has not opposed?

## Numbers 23:9
From the rocky peaks I see them, from the hills I observe them. Here is a people who live apart and do not count themselves among the nations.

## Numbers 23:10
Who can count the dust of Jacob, or number even a fourth of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and may my end be like theirs!”

## Numbers 23:11
Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies, but you have blessed them instead!”

## Numbers 23:12
Balaam replied, “Must I not speak what the Lord has put in my mouth?”

## Numbers 23:13
Balak then said, “Come with me to another place where you can see them; you will only see a part of them, not all. From there, curse them for me.”

## Numbers 23:14
So he took Balaam to the field of Zophim on the top of Pisgah, where he built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each.

## Numbers 23:15
Balaam said to Balak, “Stand here by your offering while I meet with the Lord over there.”

## Numbers 23:16
The Lord met Balaam and put a word in his mouth, saying, “Return to Balak and deliver this message.”

## Numbers 23:17
Balaam returned to Balak, who was standing by his offering with the Moabite officials. Balak asked, “What has the Lord spoken?”

## Numbers 23:18
Balaam delivered his message: “Arise, Balak, and listen; hear me, son of Zippor.

## Numbers 23:19
God is not a man, that He should lie, nor a son of man, that He should change His mind. Does He speak and not act? Does He promise and not fulfil?

## Numbers 23:20
I have received a directive to bless; He has given His blessing, and I cannot alter it.

## Numbers 23:21
No misfortune is seen in Jacob, no misery in Israel. The Lord their God is with them; the shout of a king is among them.

## Numbers 23:22
God led them out of Egypt; they possess the strength of a mighty ox.

## Numbers 23:23
There is no enchantment against Jacob, no divination against Israel. It will now be said of Jacob and Israel, ‘See what God has done!’

## Numbers 23:24
The people rise like a lioness; they rouse themselves like a lion that does not rest until it devours its prey and drinks the blood of the slain.”

## Numbers 23:25
Balak said to Balaam, “Refrain from cursing them or blessing them!”

## Numbers 23:26
Balaam answered, “Did I not tell you that I must do whatever the Lord says?”

## Numbers 23:27
Balak said, “Come, let me take you to another place. Perhaps it will please God to allow you to curse them for me from there.”

## Numbers 23:28
Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, overlooking the wasteland.

## Numbers 23:29
Balaam said, “Construct seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me.”

## Numbers 23:30
Balak did as Balaam had instructed, offering a bull and a ram on each altar.
