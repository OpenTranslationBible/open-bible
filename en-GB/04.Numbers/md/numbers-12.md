# Numbers Chapter 12

## Numbers 12:1
Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses on account of the Cushite woman he had married, for indeed he had married a Cushite.

## Numbers 12:2
They said, “Has the Lord spoken only through Moses? Has He not spoken through us as well?” And the Lord heard it.

## Numbers 12:3
(Moses was an exceedingly humble man, more so than anyone else on the face of the earth.)

## Numbers 12:4
Suddenly, the Lord said to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, “Come out to the tent of meeting, all three of you.” So they went out.

## Numbers 12:5
The Lord descended in a pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance of the tent. He called Aaron and Miriam, and when they both stepped forward,

## Numbers 12:6
He said, “Hear my words: If there is a prophet among you, I, the Lord, will reveal myself to them in visions and speak to them in dreams.

## Numbers 12:7
This is not the case with my servant Moses; he is faithful in all my house.

## Numbers 12:8
With him, I speak face to face, clearly and not in riddles; he beholds the form of the Lord. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?”

## Numbers 12:9
The anger of the Lord burned against them, and He departed.

## Numbers 12:10
When the cloud lifted from above the tent, Miriam’s skin became leprous, as white as snow. Aaron turned toward her and saw she had a defiling skin disease.

## Numbers 12:11
Aaron said to Moses, “Oh, my lord, I beg you, do not hold this sin against us, for we have acted foolishly and sinned.

## Numbers 12:12
Please, do not let her be like a stillborn infant whose flesh is half eaten away at birth.”

## Numbers 12:13
So Moses earnestly pleaded with the Lord, “Please, God, heal her!”

## Numbers 12:14
The Lord replied to Moses, “If her father had spit in her face, would she not be in disgrace for seven days? Confine her outside the camp for seven days; after that, she may be brought back.”

## Numbers 12:15
So Miriam was confined outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not move on until she was brought back.

## Numbers 12:16
Afterwards, the people left Hazeroth and camped in the wilderness of Paran.
