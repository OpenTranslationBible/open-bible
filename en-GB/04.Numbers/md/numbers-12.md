# Numbers Chapter 12

## Numbers 12:1

Miriam and Aaron began to speak against Moses because of the Cushite woman he had married.

## Numbers 12:2

“Has the Lord spoken only through Moses?” they asked. “Hasn’t He also spoken through us?” And the Lord heard this.

## Numbers 12:3

Now Moses was a very humble man, more humble than anyone else on earth.

## Numbers 12:4

At once the Lord said to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, “Come out to the tent of meeting, all three of you.”

## Numbers 12:5

Then the Lord came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance. He summoned Aaron and Miriam.

## Numbers 12:6

When both stepped forward, He said: “Listen to My words:

> When there is a prophet among you, I reveal Myself in visions and speak in dreams.

## Numbers 12:7

> But this is not true of My servant Moses; he is faithful in all My house.

## Numbers 12:8

> With him I speak face to face, clearly and not in riddles; he sees the form of the Lord.
> Why then were you not afraid to speak against him?”

## Numbers 12:9

The Lord’s anger burned against them, and He left.

## Numbers 12:10

When the cloud lifted, Miriam’s skin was leprous—it became white as snow. Aaron turned toward her and saw she had a defiling skin disease.

## Numbers 12:11

He said to Moses, “Please, my lord, do not hold against us the sin we have foolishly committed.

## Numbers 12:12

Do not let her be like a stillborn infant coming from its mother’s womb with its flesh half eaten away.”

## Numbers 12:13

So Moses cried out to the Lord, “Please, God, heal her!”

## Numbers 12:14

The Lord replied to Moses, “If her father had spit in her face, would she not be in disgrace for seven days? Confine her outside the camp for seven days; after that she may return.”

## Numbers 12:15

So Miriam was confined outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not move on until she was brought back.

## Numbers 12:16

After that, the people left Hazeroth and camped in the Desert of Paran.
