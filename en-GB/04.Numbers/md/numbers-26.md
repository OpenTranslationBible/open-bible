## Numbers 26:2
“Conduct a census of the entire assembly of the sons of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, by their families—those eligible for military service.”

## Numbers 26:3
So Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them on the plains of Moab, near the Jordan across from Jericho, saying:

## Numbers 26:4
“Let all men aged twenty and older be counted, as the Lord commanded Moses.” These are the descendants of those who came out of Egypt:

## Numbers 26:19
These were the males of Israel listed by their families. The total number counted was 601,730.

## Numbers 26:20
The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

## Numbers 26:21
“Distribute the land among them as an inheritance, according to the number of names.

## Numbers 26:22
To a larger group give a larger portion, to a smaller group a smaller one. Distribute it according to their clans by lot.

## Numbers 26:23
The land shall be assigned by lot according to the names of their ancestral tribes.

## Numbers 26:24
The number of Levites was 23,000, counted from one month old and upward. They were not included in the regular census, for no land inheritance was given to them.

## Numbers 26:25
Among all those listed, not one remained from the census Moses and Aaron had taken in the wilderness of Sinai,

## Numbers 26:26
because the Lord had said they would all perish in the wilderness. Not one was left except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.
