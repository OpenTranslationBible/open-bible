For the Lord had spoken to Moses, instructing him,

## Numbers 1:49

“You are not to count the tribe of Levi or include them in the census of the other Israelites.

## Numbers 1:50

Instead, appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the testimony, over all its furnishings and everything that belongs to it. They are to carry the tabernacle and all its furnishings; they are to take care of it and camp around it.

## Numbers 1:51

Whenever the tabernacle is to move, the Levites are to take it down, and whenever it is to be set up, the Levites shall do it. Any outsider who approaches it shall be put to death.

## Numbers 1:52

The Israelites are to camp by their divisions, each man by his own camp, and each man by his own standard.

## Numbers 1:53

But the Levites shall camp around the tabernacle of the testimony, so that there will be no divine wrath against the congregation of the Israelites. The Levites shall be responsible for the service to the tabernacle of the testimony.”

## Numbers 1:54

The Israelites did all this just as the Lord instructed Moses.
