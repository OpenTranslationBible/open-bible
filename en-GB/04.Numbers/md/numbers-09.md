# Numbers Chapter 9

## Numbers 9:1

The Lord spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, during the first month of the second year after they had left Egypt, saying,

## Numbers 9:2

“The Israelites are to observe the Passover at its designated time.

## Numbers 9:3

On the fourteenth day of this month, at twilight, you shall keep it at its appointed time; you shall observe it according to all its statutes and regulations.”

## Numbers 9:4

So Moses instructed the Israelites to observe the Passover.

## Numbers 9:5

And they did so in the wilderness of Sinai, at twilight on the fourteenth day of the first month, in accordance with all that the Lord had commanded Moses, the Israelites did.

## Numbers 9:6

However, some men were unclean due to contact with a dead body, and they could not observe the Passover on that day. They approached Moses and Aaron on that day

## Numbers 9:7

and said, “We are unclean because of a dead body, but why should we be excluded from presenting the Lord’s offering at its appointed time with the other Israelites?”

## Numbers 9:8

Moses responded, “Wait here until I hear what the Lord commands concerning you.”

## Numbers 9:9

Then the Lord spoke to Moses and said,

## Numbers 9:10

“Speak to the Israelites, saying, ‘If any of you or your descendants are unclean because of a dead body or are travelling, they may still observe the Passover to the Lord.

## Numbers 9:11

On the fourteenth day of the second month, at twilight, they shall observe it; they shall partake of it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.

## Numbers 9:12

They must not leave any of it until morning, nor break any of its bones. They must observe it according to all the statutes of the Passover.

## Numbers 9:13

But if a person who is clean and not on a journey refrains from observing the Passover, that person shall be cut off from their people for not presenting the Lord’s offering at its appointed time. They will bear the guilt of their sin.

## Numbers 9:14

If a foreigner resides among you and wishes to observe the Passover to the Lord, they must do so according to its statutes and regulations. You shall have the same law for both the foreigner and the native-born.’”

## Numbers 9:15

On the day the tabernacle, the tent of the testimony, was set up, the cloud covered it. From evening until morning, the cloud over the tabernacle appeared as fire.

## Numbers 9:16

This was the regular pattern; the cloud covered it by day, and by night it appeared as fire.

## Numbers 9:17

Whenever the cloud lifted from above the tent, the Israelites would set out; and wherever the cloud settled, there the Israelites would camp.

## Numbers 9:18

At the Lord’s command, the Israelites would set out, and at his command, they would camp. As long as the cloud stayed over the tabernacle, they remained encamped.

## Numbers 9:19

Even when the cloud lingered over the tabernacle for many days, the Israelites obeyed the Lord’s command and did not set out.

## Numbers 9:20

If sometimes the cloud was over the tabernacle for only a few days, at the Lord’s command they would camp, and then at his command, they would set out.

## Numbers 9:21

If the cloud remained only from evening until morning, when it lifted in the morning, they would set out. Whether by day or by night, whenever the cloud lifted, they would set out.

## Numbers 9:22

Whether it was two days, a month, or a year that the cloud stayed over the tabernacle, the Israelites remained encamped and did not set out; but when it lifted, they would set out.

## Numbers 9:23

At the Lord’s command, they camped, and at the Lord’s command, they set out. They obeyed the Lord’s instructions, in accordance with his command through Moses.
