# Numbers Chapter 16

## Numbers 16:1
Korah son of Izhar, a Levite, along with Dathan and Abiram from the tribe of Reuben,

## Numbers 16:2
rose up against Moses with 250 Israelite leaders, well-known community members.

## Numbers 16:3
They came as a group to oppose Moses and Aaron, saying, “You have gone too far! The whole community is holy. Why do you set yourselves above us?”

## Numbers 16:4
When Moses heard this, he fell face down.

## Numbers 16:5
Then he said to Korah and his followers, “Tomorrow the Lord will show who is His and who is holy. He will bring near the one He chooses.

## Numbers 16:6
You, Korah, and your followers are to take censers,

## Numbers 16:7
put fire and incense in them before the Lord. The man the Lord chooses will be holy.”

## Numbers 16:8
Moses also said to Korah,  
> “Listen now, you Levites!  

## Numbers 16:9
> Is it not enough for you that the God of Israel has set you apart from the rest of the Israelite community,  
> to bring you near to Himself to do the work at the Lord’s tabernacle,  
> and to stand before the community to minister to them?  

## Numbers 16:10
> He has brought you and all your fellow Levites near to Himself,  
> and now you are demanding the priesthood too!  

## Numbers 16:11
> It is against the Lord that you and your followers have banded together.  
> Who is Aaron that you should grumble against him?”  

## Numbers 16:12
Isn’t it enough you brought us out of a land of milk and honey to let us die here?

## Numbers 16:13
Now you want to rule over us as well?

## Numbers 16:14
You haven’t brought us to a land flowing with milk and honey or given us property. Will you gouge out our eyes? We will not come!”

## Numbers 16:15
Moses was very angry and said to the Lord, “Do not accept their offering. I have not taken so much as a donkey from them.”

## Numbers 16:16
Moses said to Korah, “You and your followers are to appear before the Lord—you, they, and Aaron.”

## Numbers 16:17
Each man is to bring a censer with incense and stand before the Lord.

## Numbers 16:18
So they each took their censer and stood at the entrance to the tent of meeting.

## Numbers 16:19
When they had assembled, the glory of the Lord appeared to the entire assembly.

## Numbers 16:20
The Lord said to Moses and Aaron,

## Numbers 16:21
“Separate yourselves so I can put an end to them.”

## Numbers 16:22
But Moses and Aaron fell facedown and cried, “Will You be angry with the whole assembly when only one man sins?”

## Numbers 16:23
Then the Lord said to Moses,

## Numbers 16:24
“Tell the assembly to move away from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.”

## Numbers 16:25
Moses warned the assembly, “Move away so you are not swept away because of their sin.”

## Numbers 16:26
So they moved away. Dathan and Abiram stood with their families at their tents.

## Numbers 16:27
Then Moses said, “This is how you will know the Lord sent me: if the earth opens and swallows them alive.”

## Numbers 16:28
As soon as he finished speaking, the ground split open under them.

## Numbers 16:29
The earth opened its mouth and swallowed them with their households, all Korah’s men and their possessions.

## Numbers 16:30
They went down alive into the realm of the dead, and the earth closed over them.

## Numbers 16:31
At their cries, all the Israelites ran, shouting, “The earth is going to swallow us too!”

## Numbers 16:32
And fire came out from the Lord and consumed the 250 men offering incense.

## Numbers 16:33
The Lord said to Moses,

## Numbers 16:34
“Tell Eleazar to gather the censers and hammer them into sheets to overlay the altar, for they are holy.”

## Numbers 16:35
This was to remind the Israelites that no one except a descendant of Aaron should come to offer incense.

## Numbers 16:36
The next day, the whole community grumbled, blaming Moses and Aaron for the deaths.

## Numbers 16:37
The Lord said to Moses,

## Numbers 16:38
“Move away from the assembly so I can destroy them.” But Moses and Aaron fell facedown.

## Numbers 16:39
Moses told Aaron to take a censer and make atonement for the people.

## Numbers 16:40
Aaron stood between the living and the dead, and the plague stopped.

## Numbers 16:41
But 14,700 people died from the plague, in addition to those who died with Korah.

## Numbers 16:42
Then Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance to the tent of meeting, for the plague had stopped.
