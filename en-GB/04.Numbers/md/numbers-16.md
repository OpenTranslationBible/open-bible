# Numbers Chapter 16

## Numbers 16:1

Now Korah the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, with Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, and On the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took action,

## Numbers 16:2

And they rose up before Moses, together with some of the sons of Israel, two hundred and fifty leaders of the congregation, chosen in the assembly, men of renown.

## Numbers 16:3

They assembled together against Moses and Aaron, and said to them, “You have gone far enough! For all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the Lord is in their midst; so why do you exalt yourselves above the assembly of the Lord?”

## Numbers 16:4

When Moses heard this, he fell on his face.

## Numbers 16:5

And he spoke to Korah and all his group, saying, “Tomorrow morning the Lord will make known who is His, and who is holy, and will bring that one near to Himself; the one whom He will choose, He will bring near to Himself.

## Numbers 16:6

Do this: take censers for yourselves, Korah and all your group,

## Numbers 16:7

And put fire in them, and place incense on them in the presence of the Lord tomorrow; and the man whom the Lord chooses shall be the one who is holy. You have gone far enough, you sons of Levi!”

## Numbers 16:8

Then Moses said to Korah, “Hear now, you sons of Levi:

## Numbers 16:9

Is it too small an obligation for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to Himself, to perform the service of the tabernacle of the Lord, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them;

## Numbers 16:10

And that He has brought you near, Korah, and all your brothers, sons of Levi, with you? Yet you are seeking the priesthood as well?

## Numbers 16:11

Therefore you and your entire group are the ones gathered together against the Lord; but as for Aaron, who is he, that you grumble against him?”

## Numbers 16:12

Then Moses sent a summons to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; but they said, “We will not come up.

## Numbers 16:13

Is it not enough that you have brought us up from a land flowing with milk and honey to have us die in the wilderness, but you also want to appoint yourself as a ruler over us?

## Numbers 16:14

Indeed, you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor have you given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Would you gouge out the eyes of these men? We will not come up!”

## Numbers 16:15

Then Moses became very angry and said to the Lord, “Pay no attention to their offering! I have not taken a single donkey from them, nor have I done harm to any of them.”

## Numbers 16:16

Moses said to Korah, “You and all your group be present before the Lord tomorrow, you and they along with Aaron.

## Numbers 16:17

And each of you take his firepan and put incense on it, and each of you bring his censer before the Lord, two hundred and fifty firepans; also you and Aaron shall each bring his firepan.”

## Numbers 16:18

So they took, each one his own censer, and put fire in it, and placed incense on it; and they stood at the entrance of the tent of meeting, with Moses and Aaron.

## Numbers 16:19

So Korah assembled all the congregation against them at the entrance of the tent of meeting. And the glory of the Lord appeared to all the congregation.

## Numbers 16:20

Then the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,

## Numbers 16:21

“Separate yourselves from among this congregation, so that I may consume them instantly.”

## Numbers 16:22

But they fell on their faces and said, “God, the God of the spirits of humanity, when one person sins, will You be angry with the entire congregation?”

## Numbers 16:23

Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,

## Numbers 16:24

“Speak to the congregation, saying, ‘Get away from the areas around the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.’”

## Numbers 16:25

Then Moses arose and went to Dathan and Abiram, with the elders of Israel following him.

## Numbers 16:26

And he spoke to the congregation, saying, “Get away now from the tents of these wicked men, and do not touch anything that belongs to them, or you will be swept away in all their sin.”

## Numbers 16:27

So they moved away from the areas around the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram; and Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the entrance of their tents, along with their wives, their sons, and their little ones.

## Numbers 16:28

Then Moses said, “By this you shall know that the Lord has sent me to do all these deeds; for it is not my doing.

## Numbers 16:29

If these men die the death of all mankind, or if they suffer the fate of all mankind, then the Lord has not sent me.

## Numbers 16:30

But if the Lord brings about an entirely new thing and the ground opens its mouth and swallows them with everything that belongs to them, and they go down alive into Sheol, then you will know that these men have treated the Lord disrespectfully.”

## Numbers 16:31

And as he finished speaking all these words, the ground that was under them split open;

## Numbers 16:32

And the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, their households, and all the people who belonged to Korah with all their possessions.

## Numbers 16:33

So they and all that belonged to them went down alive to Sheol; and the earth closed over them, and they perished from the midst of the assembly.

## Numbers 16:34

Then all Israel who were around them fled at their outcry, for they said, “The earth might swallow us too!”

## Numbers 16:35

Fire also came out from the Lord and consumed the two hundred and fifty men who were offering the incense.

## Numbers 16:36

Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,

## Numbers 16:37

“Say to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he shall pick up the censers from the midst of the blaze, for they are holy, and you are to scatter the burning coals further away.

## Numbers 16:38

As for the censers of these men who have sinned at the cost of their lives, make them into hammered sheets as plating for the altar, since they presented them before the Lord and they are holy; and they shall serve as a sign to the sons of Israel.”

## Numbers 16:39

So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers which the men who had been burned had presented, and they hammered them out as a covering for the altar,

## Numbers 16:40

As a reminder to the sons of Israel that no layman who is not of the descendants of Aaron is to approach to burn incense before the Lord, so that he will not become like Korah and his group—just as the Lord had spoken to him through Moses.

## Numbers 16:41

But on the next day all the congregation of the sons of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron, saying, “You are the ones who have caused the death of the Lord’s people!”

## Numbers 16:42

It came about, however, when the congregation had assembled against Moses and Aaron, that they turned toward the tent of meeting, and behold, the cloud covered it and the glory of the Lord appeared.

## Numbers 16:43

Then Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting.

## Numbers 16:44

And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,

## Numbers 16:45

“Get away from among this congregation, so that I may consume them instantly.” Then they fell on their faces.

## Numbers 16:46

And Moses said to Aaron, “Take your censer and put fire in it from the altar, and place incense on it; then bring it quickly to the congregation and make atonement for them, for wrath has gone out from the Lord, the plague has begun!”

## Numbers 16:47

Then Aaron took it just as Moses had spoken, and ran into the midst of the assembly, for the plague had begun among the people. So he put on the incense and made atonement for the people.

## Numbers 16:48

And he stood between the dead and the living, so that the plague was brought to a halt.

## Numbers 16:49

But those who died by the plague were 14,700, in addition to those who had died on account of Korah.

## Numbers 16:50

Then Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance of the tent of meeting, since the plague had been brought to a halt.
