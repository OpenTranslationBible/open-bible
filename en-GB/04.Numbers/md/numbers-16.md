# Numbers Chapter 16

## Numbers 16:1

Korah son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, along with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth, from the tribe of Reuben, took men

## Numbers 16:2

and rose up against Moses, accompanied by 250 Israelite men, leaders of the community, chosen from the assembly, men of renown.

## Numbers 16:3

They gathered together against Moses and Aaron and said to them, “You have gone too far! The whole assembly is holy, every one of them, and the Lord is among them. Why then do you raise yourselves above the Lord’s assembly?”

## Numbers 16:4

When Moses heard this, he fell on his face.

## Numbers 16:5

He then spoke to Korah and all his followers, saying, “In the morning the Lord will show who belongs to Him and who is holy, and He will bring that person near to Him. The one He chooses, He will bring near to Himself.

## Numbers 16:6

Do this: You, Korah, and all your company, take censers,

## Numbers 16:7

and tomorrow put fire in them and place incense upon them before the Lord. The man whom the Lord chooses shall be the holy one. You have gone too far, you sons of Levi!”

## Numbers 16:8

Moses also said to Korah, “Listen now, you sons of Levi:

## Numbers 16:9

Is it a small thing that the God of Israel has separated you from the rest of the Israelite community to bring you near to Himself to perform the service of the Lord’s tabernacle and to stand before the assembly to minister to them?

## Numbers 16:10

He has brought you and all your fellow Levites near to Himself, but now you seek the priesthood as well.

## Numbers 16:11

Therefore, it is against the Lord that you and all your followers have banded together. Who is Aaron that you should grumble against him?”

## Numbers 16:12

Then Moses summoned Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, but they said, “We will not come up.

## Numbers 16:13

Is it not enough that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness, but you must also make yourself a ruler over us?

## Numbers 16:14

Moreover, you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you gouge out the eyes of these men? We will not come up!”

## Numbers 16:15

Then Moses became very angry and said to the Lord, “Do not regard their offering. I have not taken one donkey from them, nor have I wronged any of them.”

## Numbers 16:16

Moses instructed Korah, “You and all your followers are to stand before the Lord tomorrow—you, they, and Aaron.

## Numbers 16:17

Each man is to take his censer and put incense in it—250 censers in all—and bring it before the Lord. You and Aaron are to bring your censers as well.”

## Numbers 16:18

So each of them took his censer, put fire in it, and placed incense on it, and stood with Moses and Aaron at the entrance to the tent of meeting.

## Numbers 16:19

When Korah had gathered all his followers in opposition at the entrance to the tent of meeting, the glory of the Lord appeared to the entire assembly.

## Numbers 16:20

Then the Lord addressed Moses and Aaron, saying,

## Numbers 16:21

“Separate yourselves from this assembly so I may consume them instantly.”

## Numbers 16:22

But they fell on their faces and said, “O God, the God who gives breath to all living things, will you be angry with the entire assembly when only one man sins?”

## Numbers 16:23

And so the Lord spoke to Moses, saying

## Numbers 16:24

“Speak to the assembly, saying, ‘Move away from the tents of Korah, Dathan and Abiram.’”

## Numbers 16:25

Moses rose and went to Dathan and Abiram, accompanied by the elders of Israel.

## Numbers 16:26

He warned the assembly, “Move back from the tents of these wicked men! Do not touch anything that belongs to them, or you will be swept away because of all their sins.”

## Numbers 16:27

So they moved away from the tents of Korah, Dathan and Abiram. Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the entrances of their tents, along with their wives, children and little ones.

## Numbers 16:28

Then Moses said, “By this you shall know that the Lord has sent me to do all these works; for it is not of my own doing.

## Numbers 16:29

If these men die a natural death, or if they suffer the fate of all mankind, then the Lord has not sent me.

## Numbers 16:30

But if the Lord creates something entirely new, and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them with all that belongs to them, and they go down alive into Sheol, then you will know that these men have shown contempt for the Lord.”

## Numbers 16:31

As soon as he finished speaking, the ground beneath them split open,

## Numbers 16:32

and the earth opened its mouth and engulfed them and their households, and all those associated with Korah, along with their possessions.

## Numbers 16:33

They went down alive into Sheol with all that belonged to them; the earth closed over them, and they perished from the midst of the assembly.

## Numbers 16:34

At their cries, all the Israelites around them fled, shouting, “The earth might swallow us too!”

## Numbers 16:35

And fire came forth from the Lord and consumed the 250 men who were offering the incense.

## Numbers 16:36

And so the Lord spoke to Moses, saying

## Numbers 16:37

“Tell Eleazar son of Aaron, the priest, to take the censers out of the charred remains and scatter the coals some distance away, for the censers are holy—

## Numbers 16:38

the censers of the men who sinned at the cost of their lives. Have them made into hammered sheets as plating for the altar, for they were presented before the Lord and have become holy. Let them be a sign to the Israelites.”

## Numbers 16:39

So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers brought by those who had been burned to death, and they were hammered out to overlay the altar,

## Numbers 16:40

as a reminder to the Israelites that no one except a descendant of Aaron should come to burn incense before the Lord, or he would become like Korah and his followers—just as the Lord had spoken to him through Moses.

## Numbers 16:41

But the next day the entire Israelite community grumbled against Moses and Aaron, saying, “You have killed the Lord’s people.”

## Numbers 16:42

When the assembly gathered in opposition to Moses and Aaron and turned toward the tent of meeting, the cloud covered it and the glory of the Lord appeared.

## Numbers 16:43

Then Moses and Aaron went to the front of the tent of meeting,

## Numbers 16:44

And so the Lord spoke to Moses, saying

## Numbers 16:45

“Get away from this assembly so that I may consume them instantly.” And they fell on their faces.

## Numbers 16:46

Then Moses said to Aaron, “Take your censer and put fire in it from the altar, and place incense on it; then hurry to the assembly to make atonement for them. Wrath has gone out from the Lord; the plague has begun.”

## Numbers 16:47

So Aaron did as Moses said, and ran into the midst of the assembly. The plague had already begun among the people, but Aaron offered the incense and made atonement for them.

## Numbers 16:48

He stood between the living and the dead, and the plague was halted.

## Numbers 16:49

But 14,700 people perished from the plague, in addition to those who had died because of Korah.

## Numbers 16:50

Then Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance to the tent of meeting, for the plague had been stopped.
