# Numbers Chapter 20

## Numbers 20:1
In the first month the whole Israelite community arrived at the Desert of Zin, and they stayed at Kadesh. There Miriam died and was buried.

## Numbers 20:2
Now there was no water for the community, and the people gathered in opposition to Moses and Aaron.

## Numbers 20:3
They quarreled with Moses and said, “If only we had died when our brothers fell dead before the Lord!

## Numbers 20:4
Why did you bring the Lord’s community into this wilderness, that we and our livestock should die here?

## Numbers 20:5
Why did you bring us up from Egypt to this terrible place? It has no grain, figs, grapes, or pomegranates—and no water to drink!”

## Numbers 20:6
Moses and Aaron went from the assembly to the entrance of the tent of meeting and fell face down, and the glory of the Lord appeared to them.

## Numbers 20:7
The Lord said to Moses,

## Numbers 20:8
“Take the staff, and you and your brother Aaron gather the assembly together. Speak to that rock before their eyes, and it will pour out its water.

## Numbers 20:9
So Moses took the staff from the Lord’s presence, just as He commanded.

## Numbers 20:10
He and Aaron gathered the assembly in front of the rock, and Moses said to them, “Listen, you rebels, must we bring you water out of this rock?”

## Numbers 20:11
Then Moses raised his arm and struck the rock twice with his staff. Water gushed out, and the community and their livestock drank.

## Numbers 20:12
But the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, “Because you did not trust Me enough to honour Me as holy in the sight of the Israelites, you will not bring this assembly into the land I give them.”

## Numbers 20:13
These were the waters of Meribah, where the Israelites quarreled with the Lord and where He was proved holy among them.

## Numbers 20:14
From Kadesh, Moses sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying: “This is what your brother Israel says: You know about all the hardships we have experienced.

## Numbers 20:15
Our ancestors went down to Egypt, and we lived there many years. The Egyptians mistreated us and our ancestors.

## Numbers 20:16
But when we cried out to the Lord, He heard us and sent an angel and brought us out of Egypt. Now we are at Kadesh, a town on the edge of your territory.

## Numbers 20:17
Please let us pass through your land. We will not go through any field or vineyard, or drink water from any well. We will stay on the King’s Highway until we pass through your territory.”

## Numbers 20:18
But Edom answered: “You may not pass through here. If you try, we will march out and attack you.”

## Numbers 20:19
The Israelites replied, “We will go along the main road. If we or our livestock drink your water, we will pay for it. We ask only to pass through on foot—nothing more.”

## Numbers 20:20
Again Edom responded: “You may not pass through.” Then Edom came out against them with a large and powerful army.

## Numbers 20:21
Since Edom refused to let them pass, Israel turned away from them.

## Numbers 20:22
The whole Israelite community set out from Kadesh and came to Mount Hor.

## Numbers 20:23
There the Lord said to Moses and Aaron,

## Numbers 20:24
“Aaron will be gathered to his people. He will not enter the land I give the Israelites, because you both disobeyed My command at the waters of Meribah.

## Numbers 20:25
Take Aaron and his son Eleazar and bring them up Mount Hor.

## Numbers 20:26
Remove Aaron’s garments and put them on Eleazar. Aaron will be gathered to his people; he will die there.”

## Numbers 20:27
Moses did as the Lord commanded. They went up Mount Hor in the sight of the whole community.

## Numbers 20:28
Moses removed Aaron’s garments and put them on Eleazar. Aaron died there on top of the mountain.

## Numbers 20:29
When the whole community learned that Aaron had died, all Israel mourned for him thirty days.
