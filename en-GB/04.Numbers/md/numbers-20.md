# Numbers Chapter 20

## Numbers 20:1

In the first month, the entire Israelite congregation arrived at the wilderness of Zin, and they stayed at Kadesh. Miriam died there and was buried.

## Numbers 20:2

There was no water for the community, and they gathered against Moses and Aaron.

## Numbers 20:3

The people contended with Moses and said, “If only we had perished when our brethren perished before the Lord!

## Numbers 20:4

Why have you brought the Lord’s people into this wilderness, where we and our livestock are at risk of perishing?

## Numbers 20:5

Why did you bring us up out of Egypt to this dreadful place? It is not a place of grain, figs, vines, or pomegranates, and there is no water to drink!”

## Numbers 20:6

Moses and Aaron went from the assembly to the entrance of the tent of meeting and fell on their faces, and the glory of the Lord appeared to them.

## Numbers 20:7

The Lord spoke to Moses, saying,

## Numbers 20:8

“Take the staff, and you and your brother Aaron gather the assembly. Speak to the rock before their eyes, and it will yield its water. You will bring forth water from the rock for the community and their livestock to drink.”

## Numbers 20:9

Moses took the staff from the presence of the Lord, as he was instructed.

## Numbers 20:10

Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly in front of the rock, and he said to them, “Listen, you rebels, must we bring water for you out of this rock?”

## Numbers 20:11

Then Moses raised his hand and struck the rock twice with his staff. Water gushed out abundantly, and the community and their livestock drank.

## Numbers 20:12

But the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, “Because you did not trust in me to honour me as holy in the sight of the Israelites, you shall not bring this assembly into the land I have given them.”

## Numbers 20:13

These were the waters of Meribah, where the Israelites contended with the Lord, and he proved himself holy among them.

## Numbers 20:14

Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, saying: “This is what your brother Israel says: You know all the hardship that has befallen us.

## Numbers 20:15

Our ancestors went down to Egypt, and we lived there for many years. The Egyptians mistreated us and our ancestors,

## Numbers 20:16

but when we cried out to the Lord, he heard our voice and sent an angel and brought us out of Egypt. Now we are at Kadesh, a town on the edge of your territory.

## Numbers 20:17

Please let us pass through your land. We will not go through any field or vineyard or drink water from any well. We will travel along the King’s Highway and not turn to the right or the left until we have passed through your territory.”

## Numbers 20:18

But Edom replied: “You shall not pass through here; if you try, we will come out against you with the sword.”

## Numbers 20:19

The Israelites said to him, “We will go along the main road, and if we or our livestock drink any of your water, we will pay for it. We only wish to pass through on foot—nothing more.”

## Numbers 20:20

But he said, “You shall not pass through.” Then Edom came out against them with a large and powerful force.

## Numbers 20:21

Since Edom refused to allow Israel to pass through their territory, Israel turned away from them.

## Numbers 20:22

The entire Israelite community set out from Kadesh and came to Mount Hor.

## Numbers 20:23

At Mount Hor, near the border of Edom, the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron,

## Numbers 20:24

“Aaron will be gathered to his people, for he shall not enter the land I have given to the Israelites, because you rebelled against my command at the waters of Meribah.

## Numbers 20:25

Take Aaron and his son Eleazar and bring them up Mount Hor.

## Numbers 20:26

Remove Aaron’s garments and put them on his son Eleazar, for Aaron will be gathered to his people and will die there.”

## Numbers 20:27

Moses followed the Lord's instructions: they ascended Mount Hor in the sight of the whole community.

## Numbers 20:28

Moses removed Aaron’s garments and put them on his son Eleazar. Aaron died there on the mountain top. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.

## Numbers 20:29

When the whole community saw that Aaron had died, all the Israelites mourned for him for thirty days.
