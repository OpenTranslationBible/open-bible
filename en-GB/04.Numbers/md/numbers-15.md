# Numbers Chapter 15

## Numbers 15:1

Then the Lord spoke to Moses and said,

## Numbers 15:2

“Speak to the Israelites and tell them: ‘When you enter the land where you are to dwell, which I am giving to you,

## Numbers 15:3

and you offer to the Lord a sacrifice by fire, a burnt offering or a sacrifice to fulfil a special vow, or as a voluntary offering or during your appointed festivals, to create a pleasing aroma to the Lord from the herd or the flock,

## Numbers 15:4

then the one who presents his offering shall present to the Lord a grain offering of a tenth of an ephah of the finest flour mixed with a quarter of a hin of oil,

## Numbers 15:5

and you shall prepare wine for the drink offering, a quarter of a hin, with the burnt offering or for the sacrifice, for each lamb.

## Numbers 15:6

For a ram, you shall prepare as a grain offering two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a third of a hin of oil,

## Numbers 15:7

and for the drink offering you shall offer a third of a hin of wine, as a pleasing aroma to the Lord.

## Numbers 15:8

When you prepare a bull as a burnt offering or a sacrifice to fulfil a special vow, or as a fellowship offering to the Lord,

## Numbers 15:9

then you shall present with the bull a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil,

## Numbers 15:10

and you shall offer as the drink offering half a hin of wine, as an offering by fire, a pleasing aroma to the Lord.

## Numbers 15:11

This is how it shall be done for each bull, ram, lamb, or goat.

## Numbers 15:12

According to the number you prepare, so you shall do for each one.

## Numbers 15:13

Everyone who is native-born must do these things in this manner when presenting an offering by fire as a pleasing aroma to the Lord.

## Numbers 15:14

Whenever a foreigner resides with you or is among you throughout your generations and wishes to make an offering by fire, as a pleasing aroma to the Lord, they shall do as you do.

## Numbers 15:15

The assembly shall have the same statute for you and for the foreigner residing among you; it shall be a lasting ordinance throughout your generations. As you are, so shall the foreigner be before the Lord.

## Numbers 15:16

One law and one ordinance shall apply to both you and the foreigner residing among you.’”

## Numbers 15:17

The Lord addressed Moses,

## Numbers 15:18

“Speak to the Israelites and tell them: ‘When you enter the land to which I am bringing you,

## Numbers 15:19

and you eat of the food of the land, you shall present a portion as an offering to the Lord.

## Numbers 15:20

From the first of your ground meal you shall present a loaf as an offering; as an offering from the threshing floor, so you shall present it.

## Numbers 15:21

From the first of your ground meal you shall give to the Lord an offering throughout your generations.

## Numbers 15:22

But if you unintentionally fail to keep any of these commands the Lord gave Moses—

## Numbers 15:23

any of the Lord’s commands to you through Moses, from the day the Lord gave them and continuing through the generations to come—

## Numbers 15:24

and if this is done unintentionally without the community being aware of it, then the whole community is to offer a young bull for a burnt offering, as a pleasing aroma to the Lord, along with its prescribed grain offering and drink offering, and a male goat for a sin offering.

## Numbers 15:25

The priest shall make atonement for the entire Israelite community, and they will be forgiven, for it was not intentional and they have presented to the Lord for their wrong a food offering and a sin offering.

## Numbers 15:26

The whole Israelite community and the foreigners residing among them will be forgiven, for all the people were involved in the unintentional wrong.

## Numbers 15:27

If an individual sins unintentionally, that person must bring a year-old female goat for a sin offering.

## Numbers 15:28

The priest shall make atonement before the Lord for the one who erred by sinning unintentionally, and when atonement has been made, that person will be forgiven.

## Numbers 15:29

One law applies to everyone who sins unintentionally, whether a native-born Israelite or a foreigner residing among you.

## Numbers 15:30

However, anyone who sins defiantly, whether native-born or foreigner, shows contempt for the Lord and must be separated from the people of Israel.

## Numbers 15:31

Because they have rejected the Lord’s word and violated His commands, they must surely be separated; their guilt remains on them.’”

## Numbers 15:32

While the Israelites were in the wilderness, they encountered a man gathering wood on the Sabbath day.

## Numbers 15:33

Those who found him gathering wood brought him to Moses, Aaron, and the whole assembly,

## Numbers 15:34

and they kept him in custody, because it had not been decided what should be done to him.

## Numbers 15:35

Then the Lord said to Moses, “The man must be put to death; the whole assembly shall stone him outside the camp.”

## Numbers 15:36

So the assembly took him outside the camp and executed him by stoning, as the Lord commanded Moses.

## Numbers 15:37

The Lord addressed Moses,

## Numbers 15:38

“Speak to the Israelites and tell them to make tassels on the corners of their garments throughout their generations, and to put a blue cord on each tassel.

## Numbers 15:39

These tassels will be for you to look at and remember all the commands of the Lord, that you may obey them and not follow your own hearts and eyes, which lead you to stray.

## Numbers 15:40

Then you will remember to obey all My commands and will be dedicated to your God.

## Numbers 15:41

I am the Lord your God, who delivered you from Egypt to be your God.”
