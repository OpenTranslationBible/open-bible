# Numbers Chapter 22

## Numbers 22:1
The Israelites journeyed to the plains of Moab and camped along the Jordan, opposite Jericho.

## Numbers 22:2
Balak, son of Zippor, witnessed all that Israel had done to the Amorites.

## Numbers 22:3
Moab was greatly afraid because of the people, for they were numerous; Moab was filled with dread because of the Israelites.

## Numbers 22:4
The Moabites said to the elders of Midian, “This horde will consume everything around us, as an ox eats up the grass of the field.” Balak, son of Zippor, was the king of Moab at that time.

## Numbers 22:5
He sent messengers to summon Balaam, son of Beor, who was at Pethor near the Euphrates, in his native land. Balak said: “A people has come out of Egypt; they cover the face of the land and have settled next to me.

## Numbers 22:6
Please come and curse these people for me, for they are too powerful for me. Perhaps I will be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land. I know that whoever you bless is blessed, and whoever you curse is cursed.”

## Numbers 22:7
The elders of Moab and Midian departed, taking with them the fee for divination. When they arrived at Balaam’s, they conveyed Balak’s message to him.

## Numbers 22:8
Balaam said to them, “Spend the night here, and I will bring you back the answer the Lord gives me.” So the Moabite leaders stayed with him.

## Numbers 22:9
The Lord approached Balaam and inquired, “Who are these men with you?”

## Numbers 22:10
Balaam replied to God, “Balak, son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent me this message:

## Numbers 22:11
‘A people has come out of Egypt and covers the face of the land. Come now, curse them for me; perhaps I will be able to fight them and drive them out.’”

## Numbers 22:12
But God said to Balaam, “Do not go with them. You must not curse the people, for they are blessed.”

## Numbers 22:13
Balaam rose in the morning and told Balak’s officials, “Return to your own land, for the Lord has refused to let me go with you.”

## Numbers 22:14
The Moabite officials returned to Balak and reported, “Balaam refused to come with us.”

## Numbers 22:15
Balak sent other officials, more numerous and more distinguished than the first.

## Numbers 22:16
They came to Balaam and said, “This is what Balak, son of Zippor, says: Do not let anything prevent you from coming to me,

## Numbers 22:17
for I will reward you richly and do whatever you ask. Please come and curse these people for me.”

## Numbers 22:18
Balaam answered them, “Even if Balak gave me his palace filled with silver and gold, I could not do anything great or small beyond the command of the Lord my God.

## Numbers 22:19
Now, please stay here tonight as well, so that I may find out what else the Lord will tell me.”

## Numbers 22:20
That night, God came to Balaam and said, “Since these men have come to call you, go with them, but only do what I tell you.”

## Numbers 22:21
Balaam rose early, prepared his donkey, and accompanied the Moabite officials.

## Numbers 22:22
But God was angry when he went, and the angel of the Lord stood in the road to oppose him. Balaam was riding his donkey, and his two servants were with him.

## Numbers 22:23
When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand, it turned off the road into a field. Balaam beat it to bring it back onto the road.

## Numbers 22:24
The angel of the Lord then stood in a narrow path through the vineyards, with walls on both sides.

## Numbers 22:25
When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord, it pressed against the wall, crushing Balaam’s foot against it. So he beat the donkey again.

## Numbers 22:26
The angel of the Lord moved on further and stood in a narrow place where there was no room to turn, either to the right or to the left.

## Numbers 22:27
Seeing the angel of the Lord, the donkey lay down under Balaam, causing him to become angry and strike it with his staff.

## Numbers 22:28
Then the Lord enabled the donkey to speak, and it said to Balaam, “What have I done to you to make you strike me these three times?”

## Numbers 22:29
Balaam replied to the donkey, “You have embarrassed me! If only I had a sword in my hand, I would have killed you by now.”

## Numbers 22:30
The donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your own donkey, which you have ridden all your life to this day? Have I ever been in the habit of doing this to you?” “No,” he replied.

## Numbers 22:31
Then the Lord allowed Balaam to see clearly, and he perceived the angel of the Lord standing in the road with his sword drawn. So he bowed low and fell facedown.

## Numbers 22:32
The angel of the Lord asked him, “Why have you struck your donkey these three times? I have come here to oppose you because your path is a reckless one before me.

## Numbers 22:33
The donkey saw me and turned aside from me these three times. If it had not turned aside, I would certainly have taken your life by now, but I would have spared it.”

## Numbers 22:34
Balaam said to the angel of the Lord, “I have sinned. I did not realise you were standing in the road to oppose me. If you are displeased, I will go back.”

## Numbers 22:35
The angel of the Lord said to Balaam, “Go with the men, but speak only what I tell you.” So Balaam continued with Balak’s officials.

## Numbers 22:36
Upon hearing of Balaam's approach, Balak went out to meet him at the Moabite town on the Arnon border, at the edge of his territory.

## Numbers 22:37
Balak said to Balaam, “Did I not send you an urgent summons? Why did you not come to me? Am I really unable to reward you?”

## Numbers 22:38
Balaam replied, “Well, I have come to you now. But can I say just anything? I must speak only what God puts in my mouth.”

## Numbers 22:39
Balaam then accompanied Balak to Kiriath Huzoth.

## Numbers 22:40
Balak offered cattle and sheep, and shared them with Balaam and the officials who were with him.

## Numbers 22:41
The next morning, Balak took Balaam up to the high places of Baal, and from there he could see part of the Israelite camp.
