# Numbers Chapter 22

## Numbers 22:1
Then the Israelites traveled to the plains of Moab and camped along the Jordan across from Jericho.

## Numbers 22:2
Now Balak son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites,

## Numbers 22:3
and Moab was terrified because there were so many people. Indeed, Moab was filled with dread because of the Israelites.

## Numbers 22:4
The Moabites said to the elders of Midian, “This horde will lick up everything around us, like an ox licks up the grass.” So Balak, king of Moab,

## Numbers 22:5
sent messengers to summon Balaam son of Beor, who was at Pethor, near the Euphrates. He said, “A people has come from Egypt; they cover the face of the land and are settling next to me.

## Numbers 22:6
Come now and curse them for me, because they are too powerful. Perhaps then I will be able to defeat them and drive them out. For I know that whoever you bless is blessed, and whoever you curse is cursed.”

## Numbers 22:7
The elders of Moab and Midian left with payment for divination and came to Balaam. They told him what Balak had said.

## Numbers 22:8
“Spend the night here,” Balaam said, “and I will report back with whatever the Lord tells me.” So the Moabite officials stayed with him.

## Numbers 22:9
God came to Balaam and asked, “Who are these men with you?”

## Numbers 22:10
Balaam said, “Balak king of Moab sent me a message:

## Numbers 22:11
‘A people has come from Egypt and covers the land. Now come and curse them for me; perhaps I will be able to fight them and drive them away.’”

## Numbers 22:12
But God said to Balaam, “Do not go with them. You must not curse them, for they are blessed.”

## Numbers 22:13
The next morning, Balaam told Balak’s officials, “Go back to your country, for the Lord has refused to let me go with you.”

## Numbers 22:14
So the Moabite officials returned and reported, “Balaam refused to come with us.”

## Numbers 22:15
Then Balak sent other officials, more numerous and more distinguished.

## Numbers 22:16
They came to Balaam and said, “Balak says: Let nothing keep you from coming.

## Numbers 22:17
I will reward you handsomely. Come and curse this people for me.”

## Numbers 22:18
But Balaam answered, “Even if Balak gave me his palace full of silver and gold, I could not do anything beyond what the Lord commands.

## Numbers 22:19
But stay here tonight, and I will find out what else the Lord says.”

## Numbers 22:20
That night God came to Balaam and said, “Since these men have come to summon you, go with them, but do only what I tell you.”

## Numbers 22:21
Balaam got up in the morning, saddled his donkey, and went with the Moabite officials.

## Numbers 22:22
But God was very angry when he went, and the angel of the Lord stood in the road to oppose him. Balaam was riding his donkey, and his two servants were with him.

## Numbers 22:23
When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord standing in the road with a drawn sword, it turned off into a field. Balaam beat it to get it back on the road.

## Numbers 22:24
Then the angel stood in a narrow path between two vineyards, with walls on both sides.

## Numbers 22:25
When the donkey saw the angel, it pressed against the wall, crushing Balaam’s foot. He beat it again.

## Numbers 22:26
Then the angel moved ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was no room to turn.

## Numbers 22:27
When the donkey saw the angel, it lay down under Balaam, and he was angry and beat it with his staff.

## Numbers 22:28
Then the Lord opened the donkey’s mouth, and it said to Balaam, “What have I done to you to make you beat me these three times?”

## Numbers 22:29
Balaam answered, “You have made a fool of me! If only I had a sword, I would kill you!”

## Numbers 22:30
The donkey said, “Am I not your own donkey, which you have always ridden? Have I been in the habit of doing this to you?” “No,” he said.

## Numbers 22:31
Then the Lord opened Balaam’s eyes, and he saw the angel standing in the road with sword drawn. He bowed low and fell facedown.

## Numbers 22:32
The angel said, “Why have you beaten your donkey these three times? I have come to oppose you because your path is reckless before Me.

## Numbers 22:33
The donkey saw Me and turned away. If it hadn’t, I would have killed you and spared it.”

## Numbers 22:34
Balaam said, “I have sinned. I didn’t realise You were standing in the road. If You are displeased, I will go back.”

## Numbers 22:35
The angel said, “Go with the men, but speak only what I tell you.” So Balaam went on with Balak’s officials.

## Numbers 22:36
When Balak heard Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him.

## Numbers 22:37
Balak said, “Didn’t I send you an urgent summons? Why didn’t you come? Don’t you realise I can reward you?”

## Numbers 22:38
Balaam answered, “I’ve come, but I can only speak the words God puts in my mouth.”

## Numbers 22:39
Then Balaam went with Balak to Kiriath Huzoth.

## Numbers 22:40
Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and gave portions to Balaam and the officials.

## Numbers 22:41
The next morning Balak took Balaam up to Bamoth Baal, where he could see part of the people.
