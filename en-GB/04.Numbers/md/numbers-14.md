# Numbers Chapter 14

## Numbers 14:1
That night, the entire congregation raised their voices and cried aloud, and the people wept.

## Numbers 14:2
All the Israelites complained against Moses and Aaron, and the whole assembly said to them, “If only we had perished in Egypt! Or even in this wilderness!

## Numbers 14:3
Why is the Lord bringing us to this land to fall by the sword? Our wives and children will be taken as plunder. Would it not be better for us to return to Egypt?”

## Numbers 14:4
And they said to one another, “Let us appoint a leader and go back to Egypt.”

## Numbers 14:5
Then Moses and Aaron fell facedown before the whole assembly of the Israelites gathered there.

## Numbers 14:6
Joshua, son of Nun, and Caleb, son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had explored the land, tore their garments;

## Numbers 14:7
and they said to the entire assembly of the Israelites, “The land we passed through and explored is exceedingly good.

## Numbers 14:8
If the Lord finds favour with us, He will lead us into this land, a land flowing with milk and honey, and give it to us.

## Numbers 14:9
Only do not rebel against the Lord. Do not be afraid of the people of the land, for they will be our prey. Their protection is gone, and the Lord is with us. Do not fear them.”

## Numbers 14:10
But the whole assembly discussed stoning them. Then the glory of the Lord appeared at the tent of meeting to all the Israelites.

## Numbers 14:11
The Lord said to Moses, “How long will these people show contempt for Me? How long will they refuse to believe in Me, despite all the signs I have performed among them?

## Numbers 14:12
I will strike them with a plague and destroy them, but I will make you into a nation greater and mightier than they.”

## Numbers 14:13
Moses said to the Lord, “Then the Egyptians will hear of it! By Your power You brought these people up from among them.

## Numbers 14:14
And they will tell the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that You, Lord, are with these people and that You, Lord, have been seen face to face, that Your cloud stays over them, and that You go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.

## Numbers 14:15
If You bring about the demise of all these people, the nations who have heard this report about You will say,

## Numbers 14:16
‘The Lord was not able to bring these people into the land He promised them on oath, so He destroyed them in the wilderness.’

## Numbers 14:17
“Now, let the power of the Lord be great, just as You have declared:

## Numbers 14:18
‘The Lord is slow to anger, abounding in love and forgiving sin and rebellion. Yet He does not leave the guilty unpunished; He holds the children accountable for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation.’

## Numbers 14:19
In accordance with Your great love, forgive the wrongdoing of these people, just as You have pardoned them from the time they left Egypt until now.”

## Numbers 14:20
The Lord replied, “I have pardoned them, as you requested.

## Numbers 14:21
Nevertheless, as surely as I live and as the glory of the Lord fills the whole earth,

## Numbers 14:22
not one of those who witnessed My glory and the signs I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet disobeyed Me and tested Me ten times—

## Numbers 14:23
not one of them will ever see the land I promised on oath to their ancestors. Those who have shown contempt for Me will not see it.

## Numbers 14:24
But because My servant Caleb has a different spirit and follows Me wholeheartedly, I will bring him into the land he explored, and his descendants will inherit it.

## Numbers 14:25
Since the Amalekites and the Canaanites are living in the valleys, turn back tomorrow and set out towards the wilderness along the route to the Red Sea.”

## Numbers 14:26
The Lord said to Moses and Aaron:

## Numbers 14:27
“How long will this wicked community grumble against Me? I have heard the complaints of these discontented Israelites.

## Numbers 14:28
So tell them, ‘As surely as I live, declares the Lord, I will do to you just as you have spoken:

## Numbers 14:29
In this wilderness your bodies will fall—every one of you twenty years old or more who was counted in the census and who has complained against Me.

## Numbers 14:30
None of you will enter the land I swore to make your home, except for Caleb, son of Jephunneh, and Joshua, son of Nun.

## Numbers 14:31
As for your children whom you said would be taken as plunder, I will bring them in to enjoy the land you have rejected.

## Numbers 14:32
However, your bodies will meet their end in this wilderness.

## Numbers 14:33
Your children will be shepherds here for forty years, enduring the consequences of your unfaithfulness, until the last of your bodies lies in the wilderness.

## Numbers 14:34
For forty years—one year for each of the forty days you explored the land—you will bear the consequences of your sins and know what it is like to have Me against you.’

## Numbers 14:35
I, the Lord, have spoken, and I will surely do these things to this entire rebellious community, which has banded together against Me. They will meet their end in this wilderness; here they will perish.”

## Numbers 14:36
So the men Moses had sent to explore the land, who returned and made the whole community grumble against him by spreading a negative report about it—

## Numbers 14:37
these men who were responsible for spreading the negative report about the land were struck down and died of a plague before the Lord.

## Numbers 14:38
Of the men who went to explore the land, only Joshua, son of Nun, and Caleb, son of Jephunneh, remained alive.

## Numbers 14:39
When Moses reported this to all the Israelites, they mourned greatly.

## Numbers 14:40
Early the next morning they set out for the highest point in the hill country, saying, “Now we are ready to go up to the land the Lord promised. Indeed, we have sinned!”

## Numbers 14:41
But Moses said, “Why are you going against the Lord’s command? This will not succeed!

## Numbers 14:42
Do not proceed, for the Lord is not with you. You will face defeat at the hands of your enemies,

## Numbers 14:43
for the Amalekites and the Canaanites will confront you there. Since you have turned away from the Lord, He will not support you, and you will fall by the sword.”

## Numbers 14:44
Nevertheless, in their presumption they went up towards the highest point in the hill country, though neither Moses nor the ark of the Lord’s covenant departed from the camp.

## Numbers 14:45
Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites who lived in that hill country came down and attacked them and scattered them as far as Hormah.
