# Numbers Chapter 4

## Numbers 4:1

Then the Lord spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,

## Numbers 4:2

“Take a census of the descendants of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, by their families, by their fathers’ households,

## Numbers 4:3

From thirty years old and upward, even to fifty years old, everyone who can enter the service of ministry to do work in the tent of meeting.

## Numbers 4:4

This is the work of the descendants of Kohath in the tent of meeting, concerning the most holy things.

## Numbers 4:5

When the camp sets out, Aaron and his sons shall go in and take down the veil of the curtain, and cover the ark of the testimony with it;

## Numbers 4:6

And they shall place a covering of fine leather on it, and spread over it a cloth of pure blue, and insert its carrying poles.

## Numbers 4:7

Over the table of the bread of the Presence they shall also spread a blue cloth, and put on it the dishes, the pans, the sacrificial bowls, and the jars for the drink offering; and the continual bread shall be on it.

## Numbers 4:8

And they shall spread over them a scarlet cloth, and cover the same with a covering of fine leather, and insert its carrying poles.

## Numbers 4:9

Then they shall take a blue cloth and cover the lampstand for the light, along with its lamps, its tongs, its trays, and all its oil containers, by which they attend to it;

## Numbers 4:10

And they shall put it and all its utensils in a covering of fine leather, and put it on the carrying bars.

## Numbers 4:11

Over the golden altar they shall spread a blue cloth, and cover it with a covering of fine leather, and insert its carrying poles;

## Numbers 4:12

And they shall take all the utensils of service with which they serve in the sanctuary, and put them in a blue cloth, and cover them with a covering of fine leather, and put them on the carrying bars.

## Numbers 4:13

Then they shall clean away the ashes from the altar, and spread a purple cloth over it.

## Numbers 4:14

They shall also place on it all its utensils by which they serve in connection with it: the firepans, the forks, the shovels, and the basins, all the utensils of the altar; and they shall spread a covering of fine leather over it and insert its carrying poles.

## Numbers 4:15

When Aaron and his sons have finished covering the holy objects and all the furnishings of the sanctuary, when the camp is to set out, then the descendants of Kohath shall come to carry them, so that they will not touch the holy objects and die. These are the things in the tent of meeting that the sons of Kohath are to carry.

## Numbers 4:16

Now the responsibility of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest is the oil for the light, the fragrant incense, the continual grain offering, and the anointing oil—the responsibility of all the tabernacle and everything that is in it, with the sanctuary and its furnishings.”

## Numbers 4:17

Then the Lord spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,

## Numbers 4:18

“Do not let the tribe of the families of the Kohathites be eliminated from among the Levites.

## Numbers 4:19

Rather, do this for them so that they will live and not die when they approach the most holy objects: Aaron and his sons shall go in and assign each of them to his work and to his load;

## Numbers 4:20

But they shall not come in to see the holy objects even for a moment, or they will die.”

## Numbers 4:21

Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,

## Numbers 4:22

“Take a census of the sons of Gershon also, by their fathers’ households, by their families;

## Numbers 4:23

From thirty years old and upward to fifty years old you shall count them; all who can enter to perform service, to do the work in the tent of meeting.

## Numbers 4:24

This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, in serving and in carrying:

## Numbers 4:25

They shall carry the tent curtains of the tabernacle, and the tent of meeting with its covering and the covering of fine leather that is on top of it, and the curtain for the entrance of the tent of meeting,

## Numbers 4:26

And the curtains of the courtyard, the curtain for the entrance of the gate of the courtyard which is around the tabernacle and the altar, and their ropes, and all the equipment for their service; and everything that is to be done by them, they shall perform.

## Numbers 4:27

All the service of the sons of the Gershonites, all their loads, and all their work, shall be performed at the command of Aaron and his sons; and you shall assign to them as a duty all their loads.

## Numbers 4:28

This is the service of the families of the sons of the Gershonites in the tent of meeting, and their duties shall be under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

## Numbers 4:29

As for the sons of Merari, you shall count them by their families, by their fathers’ households;

## Numbers 4:30

From thirty years old and upward to fifty years old you shall count them, everyone who can enter the service of ministry to do the work of the tent of meeting.

## Numbers 4:31

Now this is the duty of their loads, for all their service in the tent of meeting: the boards of the tabernacle, its crossbars, its pillars, its bases,

## Numbers 4:32

And the pillars around the courtyard, with their bases, their pegs, and their ropes, with all their equipment and with all their service; and you shall assign each man by name the items he is to carry.

## Numbers 4:33

This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari, for all their service in the tent of meeting, under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.”

## Numbers 4:34

So Moses, Aaron, and the leaders of the congregation counted the sons of the Kohathites by their families, and by their fathers’ households,

## Numbers 4:35

From thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old, everyone who could enter the service for work in the tent of meeting;

## Numbers 4:36

Their numbered men by their families were 2,750.

## Numbers 4:37

These were the numbered men of the families of the Kohathites, everyone who was serving in the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron counted according to the command of the Lord through Moses.

## Numbers 4:38

The numbered men of the sons of Gershon, by their families and by their fathers’ households,

## Numbers 4:39

From thirty years old and upward to fifty years old, everyone who could enter the service for work in the tent of meeting—

## Numbers 4:40

Their numbered men by their families, by their fathers’ households, were 2,630.

## Numbers 4:41

These were the numbered men of the families of the sons of Gershon, everyone serving in the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron counted according to the command of the Lord.

## Numbers 4:42

The numbered men of the families of the sons of Merari, by their families, by their fathers’ households,

## Numbers 4:43

From thirty years old and upward to fifty years old, everyone who could enter the service for work in the tent of meeting—

## Numbers 4:44

Their numbered men by their families were 3,200.

## Numbers 4:45

These were the numbered men of the families of the sons of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron counted according to the command of the Lord through Moses.

## Numbers 4:46

All the numbered men of the Levites, whom Moses, Aaron, and the leaders of Israel counted by their families and by their fathers’ households,

## Numbers 4:47

From thirty years old and upward to fifty years old, everyone who could enter to do the work of service and the work of carrying in the tent of meeting—

## Numbers 4:48

Their numbered men were 8,580.

## Numbers 4:49

According to the command of the Lord through Moses, they were counted, everyone by his service or carrying duty; so these were his numbered men, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
