# Numbers Chapter 4

## Numbers 4:1

The Lord communicated with Moses and Aaron, saying,

## Numbers 4:2

“Take a census of the Kohathite branch of the Levites, by their families and their fathers’ households.

## Numbers 4:3

Count all the men from thirty to fifty years old who are eligible to serve in the work at the tent of meeting.

## Numbers 4:4

This is the duty of the Kohathites in the tent of meeting: the care of the most holy things.

## Numbers 4:5

“When the camp is to move, Aaron and his sons shall enter and take down the shielding curtain and cover the ark of the covenant with it.

## Numbers 4:6

Then they shall cover it with a durable leather and spread a cloth of violet over that, and insert the carrying poles.

## Numbers 4:7

Over the table of the Presence they shall spread a violet cloth and place on it the dishes, pans, sacrificial bowls, and the jugs for the drink offering; the continual bread shall remain on it.

## Numbers 4:8

They shall spread a scarlet cloth over these, cover them with a durable leather, and insert the carrying poles.

## Numbers 4:9

They shall take a violet cloth and cover the lampstand for the light, along with its lamps, wick trimmers, trays, and all its oil containers.

## Numbers 4:10

Then they shall put it and all its utensils in a covering of durable leather and place it on the carrying frame.

## Numbers 4:11

Over the gold altar they shall spread a violet cloth and cover it with a durable leather, and insert the carrying poles.

## Numbers 4:12

They shall take all the articles used for ministering in the sanctuary, wrap them in a violet cloth, cover them with a durable leather, and place them on a carrying frame.

## Numbers 4:13

They shall remove the ashes from the bronze altar and spread a purple cloth over it.

## Numbers 4:14

Then they shall place on it all the utensils used for ministering at the altar, including the firepans, forks, shovels, and basins. Over it, they shall spread a covering of durable leather and insert the carrying poles.

## Numbers 4:15

After Aaron and his sons have finished covering the holy objects and all the furnishings of the sanctuary, when the camp is set to move, the Kohathites shall come to carry them, but they must not touch the holy things or they will die. These are the items in the tent of meeting that the Kohathites are to carry.

## Numbers 4:16

Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, shall be in charge of the oil for the light, the fragrant incense, the regular grain offering, and the anointing oil. He shall oversee the entire tabernacle and everything in it, including its holy furnishings and articles.”

## Numbers 4:17

The Lord communicated with Moses and Aaron, saying,

## Numbers 4:18

“Ensure that the Kohathite tribal clans are not cut off from among the Levites.

## Numbers 4:19

To ensure they live and do not die when they approach the most holy things, do this for them: Aaron and his sons shall enter and assign each man his work and what he is to carry.

## Numbers 4:20

However, the Kohathites must not approach and gaze upon the holy things, even briefly, lest they perish.”

## Numbers 4:21

The Lord communicated with Moses, saying,

## Numbers 4:22

“Take a census of the Gershonites also, by their families and their fathers’ households.

## Numbers 4:23

Count all the men from thirty to fifty years old who are eligible to perform service in the work at the tent of meeting.

## Numbers 4:24

This is what the Gershonite clans are responsible for in their carrying and other duties:

## Numbers 4:25

They shall carry the curtains of the tabernacle, the tent of meeting with its covering, and the outer covering of durable leather, and the curtain for the entrance to the tent of meeting,

## Numbers 4:26

and the curtains of the courtyard surrounding the tabernacle and altar, the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard, the ropes, and all the equipment used in their service. The Gershonites shall perform all that needs to be done with these things.

## Numbers 4:27

All their service, whether carrying or doing other work, shall be performed under the direction of Aaron and his sons. You shall assign to them all their duties and responsibilities.

## Numbers 4:28

This is the service of the Gershonite clans at the tent of meeting. Their duties shall be under the direction of Ithamar, son of Aaron the priest.

## Numbers 4:29

Count the Merarites by their clans and their fathers’ households.

## Numbers 4:30

Count all the men from thirty to fifty years old who are eligible to serve in the work at the tent of meeting.

## Numbers 4:31

This is their duty as part of all their service at the tent: they are to carry the frames of the tabernacle, its crossbars, posts, and bases,

## Numbers 4:32

as well as the posts of the surrounding courtyard with their bases, tent pegs, ropes, all their equipment, and everything related to their use. Assign to each man by name the specific items he is to carry.

## Numbers 4:33

This is what the Merarite clans are responsible for as they work at the tent of meeting under the direction of Ithamar, son of Aaron, the priest.
