# Numbers Chapter 5

## Numbers 5:1

The Lord then spoke to Moses, with these words,

## Numbers 5:2

“Instruct the Israelites to remove from the camp everyone who has a defiling skin disease, anyone with a discharge, and anyone who is unclean due to contact with a dead body.

## Numbers 5:3

You shall send both male and female outside the camp so that they do not defile the camp where I dwell among them.”

## Numbers 5:4

The Israelites acted accordingly and sent them outside the camp; they did just as the Lord had instructed Moses.

## Numbers 5:5

The Lord then spoke to Moses, with these words,

## Numbers 5:6

“Speak to the Israelites: ‘When a man or woman commits any sin against another, thereby being unfaithful to the Lord, and becomes guilty,

## Numbers 5:7

they must confess the sin they have committed. They shall make full restitution for their wrongdoing, adding a fifth to its value, and give it to the person they have wronged.

## Numbers 5:8

If the person has no close relative to whom restitution can be made, the restitution belongs to the Lord and must be given to the priest, along with the ram for atonement for the wrongdoer.

## Numbers 5:9

Every sacred contribution the Israelites bring to a priest shall belong to him.

## Numbers 5:10

Each person’s sacred gifts are their own, but whatever is given to the priest shall belong to the priest.’”

## Numbers 5:11

The Lord addressed Moses with these words,

## Numbers 5:12

“Tell the Israelites: ‘If a man’s wife strays and is unfaithful to him,

## Numbers 5:13

and another man has sexual relations with her, and this is concealed from her husband and her impurity is undiscovered, with no witness against her and she has not been caught in the act,

## Numbers 5:14

and if feelings of jealousy come over her husband and he suspects his wife when she is impure—or if he is jealous and suspects her although she is not impure—

## Numbers 5:15

then he shall bring his wife to the priest, along with an offering of a tenth of an ephah of barley flour. He shall not pour oil on it or put incense on it, for it is a grain offering of jealousy, a reminder-offering to draw attention to wrongdoing.

## Numbers 5:16

“‘The priest shall bring her forward and have her stand before the Lord.

## Numbers 5:17

The priest shall take holy water in a clay jar and put some dust from the tabernacle floor into the water.

## Numbers 5:18

The priest shall then have the woman stand before the Lord, loosen her hair, and place in her hands the reminder-offering, the grain offering of jealousy, while he holds the bitter water that brings a curse.

## Numbers 5:19

The priest shall put the woman under oath and say to her, “If no other man has had sexual relations with you and you have not gone astray into impurity while married to your husband, may this bitter water that brings a curse not harm you.

## Numbers 5:20

But if you have gone astray while married to your husband and have made yourself impure by having sexual relations with a man other than your husband”—

## Numbers 5:21

then the priest shall have the woman swear an oath of the curse, and he shall say to her, “may the Lord make you a curse among your people when he causes your womb to miscarry and your abdomen to swell.

## Numbers 5:22

May this water that brings a curse enter your body to make your abdomen swell and your womb miscarry.” And the woman shall say, “Amen. So be it.”

## Numbers 5:23

“‘The priest shall write these curses on a scroll and wash them off into the bitter water.

## Numbers 5:24

He shall make the woman drink the bitter water that brings a curse, and this water that brings a curse will enter her and cause bitterness.

## Numbers 5:25

The priest shall take the grain offering of jealousy from her hands, wave it before the Lord, and bring it to the altar.

## Numbers 5:26

The priest shall take a handful of the grain offering as a memorial offering and burn it on the altar; after that, he shall make the woman drink the water.

## Numbers 5:27

If she has made herself impure and been unfaithful to her husband, the water that brings a curse will enter her, causing her abdomen to swell and her womb to miscarry, and she will become a curse among her people.

## Numbers 5:28

But if the woman has not made herself impure and is clean, she will be cleared of guilt and will be able to conceive children.

## Numbers 5:29

“‘This is the law of jealousy when a wife goes astray and defiles herself while married to her husband,

## Numbers 5:30

or when feelings of jealousy come over a man and he suspects his wife. The priest shall have her stand before the Lord and apply this entire law to her.

## Numbers 5:31

The man will be free of guilt, but the woman shall bear the consequences of her guilt.’”
