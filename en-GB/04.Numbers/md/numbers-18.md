# Numbers Chapter 18

## Numbers 18:1
The Lord spoke to Aaron, saying, “You, your sons, and your family are to bear the responsibility for any offences associated with the sanctuary, and you and your sons alone are to bear the responsibility for any offences related to your priesthood.

## Numbers 18:2
Bring your fellow Levites, the tribe of your ancestors, to join you and assist you while you and your sons minister before the tent of the testimony.

## Numbers 18:3
They shall be responsible to you and perform duties for the whole tent, but they must not approach the furnishings of the sanctuary or the altar, lest both they and you die.

## Numbers 18:4
They are to join you and take care of the duties of the tent of meeting, all the work at the tent, but no unauthorised person may come near you.

## Numbers 18:5
You shall be responsible for the duties of the sanctuary and the altar, so that no wrath will fall upon the Israelites again.

## Numbers 18:6
I have selected your fellow Levites from among the Israelites as a gift to you, dedicated to the Lord, to perform the work at the tent of meeting.

## Numbers 18:7
But only you and your sons shall serve as priests in relation to everything at the altar and inside the veil. I am giving you the priesthood as a gift. Anyone else who comes near shall be put to death.”

## Numbers 18:8
Then the Lord said to Aaron, “I have put you in charge of my offerings; all the holy gifts the Israelites present to me, I give to you and your sons as your portion, a permanent share.

## Numbers 18:9
This shall be yours from the most holy offerings, kept from the fire; from all their gifts, whether grain, sin, or guilt offerings, they are most holy to you and your sons.

## Numbers 18:10
Eat it as something most holy; every male shall eat it. Regard it as holy.

## Numbers 18:11
This also is yours: whatever is set aside from the gifts of all the wave offerings of the Israelites. I give them to you and your sons and daughters as a perpetual share. Everyone in your household who is ceremonially clean may eat it.

## Numbers 18:12
I give you all the best of the fresh olive oil and all the best of the fresh wine and grain, the firstfruits they give to the Lord.

## Numbers 18:13
The first ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring to the Lord, shall be yours. Everyone in your household who is clean may eat it.

## Numbers 18:14
Everything devoted to the Lord in Israel shall be yours.

## Numbers 18:15
The first offspring of every womb, both human and animal, that is offered to the Lord is yours. But you must redeem every firstborn son and the firstborn of unclean animals.

## Numbers 18:16
When they are a month old, you must redeem them at the redemption price of five shekels of silver, according to the sanctuary shekel, which is twenty gerahs.

## Numbers 18:17
But the firstborn of a cow, a sheep, or a goat you shall not redeem; they are holy. Sprinkle their blood on the altar and burn their fat as a food offering, a pleasing aroma to the Lord.

## Numbers 18:18
Their meat shall be yours, just as the breast of the wave offering and the right thigh are yours.

## Numbers 18:19
All the offerings of the holy gifts, which the Israelites present to the Lord, I give to you and your sons and daughters as a perpetual share. It is an everlasting covenant of salt before the Lord for both you and your descendants.

## Numbers 18:20
The Lord said to Aaron, “You shall have no inheritance in their land, nor own any portion among them; I am your portion and your inheritance among the Israelites.

## Numbers 18:21
To the Levites, I give all the tithes in Israel as their inheritance in return for the work they do while serving at the tent of meeting.

## Numbers 18:22
From now on, the Israelites must not approach the tent of meeting, or they will bear the consequences of their sin and will die.

## Numbers 18:23
Only the Levites shall perform the service of the tent of meeting and bear their own guilt. This is a lasting ordinance for the generations to come. They will have no inheritance among the Israelites.

## Numbers 18:24
Instead, I give to the Levites as their inheritance the tithes that the Israelites present as an offering to the Lord. That is why I have said concerning them: ‘They shall have no inheritance among the Israelites.’”

## Numbers 18:25
The Lord spoke to Moses,

## Numbers 18:26
“Tell the Levites: ‘When you receive from the Israelites the tithe I give you as your inheritance, you must offer a tenth of that tithe as a contribution to the Lord.

## Numbers 18:27
Your offering will be credited to you as grain from the threshing floor or juice from the wine vat.

## Numbers 18:28
In this way, you shall also present an offering to the Lord from all the tithes you receive from the Israelites. From these tithes, you must give the Lord’s portion to Aaron the priest.

## Numbers 18:29
You are to offer the finest and most sacred part of everything given to you as the Lord’s portion.’

## Numbers 18:30
Say to them, ‘When you present the best part, it will be credited to you as the product of the threshing floor or the wine vat.

## Numbers 18:31
You and your households may consume the remainder anywhere, for it is your compensation for your work at the tent of meeting.

## Numbers 18:32
By offering the best part, you will not be guilty in this matter; then you will not defile the holy offerings of the Israelites, and you will not die.’”
