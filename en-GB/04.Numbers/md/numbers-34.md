The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

## Numbers 34:2
“Command the Israelites and say to them: When you enter the land of Canaan, these are the boundaries the land will have as your inheritance.

## Numbers 34:3
Your southern border will begin at the wilderness of Zin along Edom. It will run from the end of the Salt Sea on the east,

## Numbers 34:4
cross south of the Scorpion Ascent, continue to Zin, and go south of Kadesh Barnea, then on to Hazar Addar and over to Azmon.

## Numbers 34:5
From Azmon the boundary will turn toward the Brook of Egypt and end at the Mediterranean Sea.

## Numbers 34:6
Your western boundary will be the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. This will be your boundary on the west.

## Numbers 34:7
Your northern boundary will start from the Mediterranean Sea and draw a line to Mount Hor.

## Numbers 34:8
From Mount Hor, draw a line to Lebo Hamath, then to Zedad.

## Numbers 34:9
The boundary will continue to Ziphron and end at Hazar Enan. This will be your northern boundary.

## Numbers 34:10
For your eastern boundary, draw a line from Hazar Enan to Shepham.

## Numbers 34:11
The boundary will go down from Shepham to Riblah, east of Ain, then descend and follow along the slopes on the eastern side of the Sea of Galilee.

## Numbers 34:12
It will run along the Jordan and end at the Salt Sea. This will be your land, with its boundaries all around.”

## Numbers 34:13
Moses commanded the Israelites: “This is the land that you are to divide by lot as an inheritance. The Lord has assigned it to the nine and a half tribes.

## Numbers 34:14
The tribes of Reuben and Gad, along with the half-tribe of Manasseh, have already received their inheritance on the east side of the Jordan.

## Numbers 34:15
These two and a half tribes received their inheritance facing Jericho, east of the Jordan.”

## Numbers 34:16
The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

## Numbers 34:17
“These are the names of the men who shall divide the land among you as an inheritance: Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun.

## Numbers 34:18
Appoint one leader from each tribe to help distribute the land.
