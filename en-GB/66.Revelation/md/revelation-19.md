# Revelation Chapter 19

## Revelation 19:1

After these things I heard something like a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying,

> “Hallelujah! Salvation, glory, and power belong to our God,

## Revelation 19:2

> because His judgments are true and righteous;  
> for He has judged the great prostitute who was corrupting the earth with her sexual immorality,  
> and He has avenged the blood of His bond-servants on her.”

## Revelation 19:3

And a second time they said,

> “Hallelujah! Her smoke rises forever and ever.”

## Revelation 19:4

And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God who sits on the throne, saying,

> “Amen. Hallelujah!”

## Revelation 19:5

And a voice came from the throne, saying,

> “Give praise to our God, all you His bond-servants,  
> you who fear Him, the small and the great.”

## Revelation 19:6

Then I heard something like the voice of a great multitude and like the sound of many waters, and like the sound of mighty peals of thunder, saying,

> “Hallelujah! For the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigns.

## Revelation 19:7

> Let us rejoice and be glad and give the glory to Him,  
> because the marriage of the Lamb has come,  
> and His bride has prepared herself.”

## Revelation 19:8

> It was given to her to clothe herself in fine linen, bright and clean;  
> for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.

## Revelation 19:9

Then he said to me, “Write: ‘Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding feast of the Lamb.’” And he said to me, “These are the true words of God.”

## Revelation 19:10

Then I fell at his feet to worship him. But he said to me, “Do not do that; I am a fellow servant of yours and your brothers and sisters who hold the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.”

## Revelation 19:11

And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and He who sat on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and wages war.

## Revelation 19:12

His eyes are a flame of fire, and on His head are many crowns; and He has a name written on Him which no one knows except Himself.

## Revelation 19:13

He is clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God.

## Revelation 19:14

And the armies which are in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, were following Him on white horses.

## Revelation 19:15

From His mouth comes a sharp sword, so that with it He may strike down the nations, and He will rule them with a rod of iron; and He treads the wine press of the fierce wrath of God, the Almighty.

## Revelation 19:16

And on His robe and on His thigh He has a name written:

“KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.”

## Revelation 19:17

Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and he cried out with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in midheaven, “Come, assemble for the great supper of God,

## Revelation 19:18

so that you may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of commanders, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them, and the flesh of all people, both free and slaves, and small and great.”

## Revelation 19:19

And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies assembled to make war against Him who sat on the horse, and against His army.

## Revelation 19:20

And the beast was seized, and with him the false prophet who performed the signs in his presence, by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshipped his image; these two were thrown alive into the lake of fire, which burns with brimstone.

## Revelation 19:21

And the rest were killed with the sword which came from the mouth of Him who sat on the horse, and all the birds were filled with their flesh.
