# Revelation Chapter 19

## Revelation 19:1

After these events, I heard a voice like the roar of a vast multitude in heaven, proclaiming:

> “Hallelujah! Salvation, glory, and power belong to our God,

## Revelation 19:2

> for His judgments are true and just.
> He has judged the great prostitute who corrupted the earth with her immorality,
> and He has avenged the blood of His servants upon her.”

## Revelation 19:3

And once more they said:

> “Hallelujah! Her smoke rises for ever and ever.”

## Revelation 19:4

The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God who sits on the throne, saying,

> “Amen, Hallelujah!”

## Revelation 19:5

Then a voice came from the throne, saying:

> “Praise our God, all you His servants,
> you who fear Him, both small and great!”

## Revelation 19:6

And I heard what seemed like the voice of a great multitude, like the sound of many waters and like mighty peals of thunder, saying:

> “Hallelujah! For the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigns.

## Revelation 19:7

> Let us rejoice and be glad and give Him glory,
> for the marriage of the Lamb has come,
> and His bride has prepared herself.”

## Revelation 19:8

> She was given fine linen to wear, bright and clean.
> (For the fine linen represents the righteous acts of the saints.)

## Revelation 19:9

Then he said to me, “Write this: ‘Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb.’” And he added, “These are the true words of God.”

## Revelation 19:10

Then I fell at his feet to worship him. But he said to me, “Do not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers and sisters who hold to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.”

## Revelation 19:11

I saw heaven opened, and there was a white horse. Its rider is called Faithful and True, and with righteousness He judges and makes war.

## Revelation 19:12

His eyes are like flames of fire, and on His head are many crowns. He has a name written that no one knows but Himself.

## Revelation 19:13

He is clothed in a robe dipped in blood, and His name is the Word of God.

## Revelation 19:14

The armies of heaven, dressed in fine linen, white and clean, were following Him on white horses.

## Revelation 19:15

From His mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations, and He will rule them with a rod of iron. He treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty.

## Revelation 19:16

On His robe and on His thigh He has this name written: King of Kings and Lord of Lords.

## Revelation 19:17

Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and he cried out with a loud voice to all the birds flying in midair, “Come, gather together for the great feast of God,

## Revelation 19:18

so that you may eat the flesh of kings, commanders, and mighty men, the flesh of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all people, free and slave, small and great.”

## Revelation 19:19

And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth with their armies gathered to wage war against the rider on the horse and His army.

## Revelation 19:20

But the beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who had performed the signs in its presence. By these signs, he had deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and worshipped its image. The two of them were thrown alive into the lake of fire burning with sulphur.

## Revelation 19:21

The rest were killed with the sword that came from the mouth of the rider on the horse, and all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh.
