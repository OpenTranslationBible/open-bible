# Revelation Chapter 5

## Revelation 5:1

I observed in the right hand of the one seated on the throne a scroll inscribed on both sides and sealed with seven seals.

## Revelation 5:2

And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?”

## Revelation 5:3

But no one in heaven, on earth, or under the earth was able to open the scroll or even look inside it.

## Revelation 5:4

I wept greatly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look inside it.

## Revelation 5:5

Then one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep! Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed. He is able to open the scroll and its seven seals.”

## Revelation 5:6

And I saw a Lamb standing between the throne and the four living creatures and the elders, looking as if it had been slain. It had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth.

## Revelation 5:7

He approached and took the scroll from the right hand of the one seated on the throne.

## Revelation 5:8

When He had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Each held a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of God’s people.

## Revelation 5:9

And they sang a new song, saying:

> “You are worthy to take the scroll
> and open its seals,
> for You were slain, and with Your blood, You purchased for God people
> from every tribe, language, people, and nation.

## Revelation 5:10

> You have made them a kingdom and priests to serve our God,
> and they will reign on the earth.”

## Revelation 5:11

Then I looked and heard the voices of many angels surrounding the throne and the living creatures and the elders; their number was thousands upon thousands, and ten thousand times ten thousand.

## Revelation 5:12

In a loud voice, they were saying:

> “Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
> to receive power, wealth, wisdom, might, honour, glory, and blessing!”

## Revelation 5:13

And I heard every creature in heaven, on earth, under the earth, and on the sea, and all that is in them, saying:

> “To Him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb
> be blessing, honour, glory, and dominion for ever and ever!”

## Revelation 5:14

The four living creatures affirmed with “Amen,” and the elders bowed down and worshipped.
