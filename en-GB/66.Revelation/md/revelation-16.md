Then I heard a loud voice from the temple, instructing the seven angels, “Go, pour out the seven bowls of God's wrath upon the earth.”

The first angel went and poured out his bowl upon the earth, and harmful, painful sores afflicted those who bore the mark of the beast and worshipped its image.

The second angel poured out his bowl into the sea, and it turned into blood like that of a dead person, causing every living creature in the sea to perish.

The third angel poured out his bowl into the rivers and springs of water, and they became blood.

## Revelation 16:5

Then I heard the angel of the waters declare,

> “Righteous are you, O Holy One, who is and who was,
> for you have passed these judgements;

## Revelation 16:6

> because they shed the blood of saints and prophets,
> and you have given them blood to drink,
> as they deserve.”

## Revelation 16:7

And I heard the altar affirm,

> “Yes, Lord God Almighty,
> true and righteous are your judgements.”

The fourth angel poured out his bowl upon the sun, and it was granted the power to scorch people with fire.

The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the east.

## Revelation 16:13

Then I saw three unclean spirits, resembling frogs, coming out of the mouth of the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet.

Huge hailstones, each weighing about a talent, fell from the sky upon people. They blasphemed God because of the plague of hail, for it was exceedingly severe.
