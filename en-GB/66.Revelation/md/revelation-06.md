# Revelation Chapter 6

## Revelation 6:1
I observed as the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures say with a voice like thunder, “Come!”

## Revelation 6:2
I looked, and there was a white horse! Its rider held a bow, and a crown was given to him, and he set out conquering and to conquer.

## Revelation 6:3
When the Lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, “Come!”

## Revelation 6:4
Then another horse appeared, a fiery red one. Its rider was granted the power to take peace from the earth, so that people would kill each other; and a large sword was given to him.

## Revelation 6:5
When the Lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, “Come!” I looked, and there was a black horse! Its rider held a pair of scales in his hand.

## Revelation 6:6
Then I heard what seemed to be a voice among the four living creatures, saying, “A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; and do not harm the oil and the wine.”

## Revelation 6:7
When the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, “Come!”

## Revelation 6:8
I looked, and there was a pale horse! Its rider was named Death, and Hades followed closely behind him. They were given authority over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword, famine, plague, and by the wild beasts of the earth.

## Revelation 6:9
When the Lamb opened the fifth seal, I saw beneath the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the testimony they had maintained.

## Revelation 6:10
They cried out in a loud voice, “How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood?”

## Revelation 6:11
Then each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to rest a little while longer, until the number of their fellow servants and their brothers and sisters, who were to be killed as they had been, was completed.

## Revelation 6:12
I watched as he opened the sixth seal. There was a great earthquake; the sun became black like sackcloth made of hair, and the whole moon turned blood red,

## Revelation 6:13
and the stars of the sky fell to the earth, as a fig tree sheds its unripe figs when shaken by a strong wind.

## Revelation 6:14
The sky vanished like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was displaced.

## Revelation 6:15
Then the kings of the earth, the nobles, the commanders, the rich, the powerful, and everyone else, both slave and free, hid in caves and among the rocks of the mountains.

## Revelation 6:16
They called to the mountains and the rocks, “Fall on us and conceal us from the presence of Him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb!

## Revelation 6:17
For the great day of Their anger has arrived, and who can withstand it?”
