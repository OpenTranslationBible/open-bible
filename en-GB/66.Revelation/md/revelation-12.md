# Revelation Chapter 12

## Revelation 12:1

A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon beneath her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.

## Revelation 12:2

She was with child and cried out, being in labour and in pain to give birth.

## Revelation 12:3

Then another sign appeared in heaven: behold, a great red dragon with seven heads and ten horns, and on its heads were seven crowns.

## Revelation 12:4

Its tail swept away a third of the stars of heaven and cast them to the earth. The dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that it might devour her child as soon as it was born.

## Revelation 12:5

She gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron. Her child was caught up to God and to his throne.

## Revelation 12:6

The woman fled into the wilderness to a place prepared for her by God, where she would be nourished for 1,260 days.

## Revelation 12:7

And war broke out in heaven, Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back.

## Revelation 12:8

But they were not strong enough, and there was no longer any place for them in heaven.

## Revelation 12:9

The great dragon was hurled down, that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who deceives the whole world. He was cast down to the earth, and his angels with him.

## Revelation 12:10

Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say:

> “Now have come the salvation and the power
> and the kingdom of our God,
> and the authority of his Christ,
> for the accuser of our brothers and sisters,
> who accuses them before our God day and night,
> has been cast down.

## Revelation 12:11

> They overcame him
> by the blood of the Lamb
> and by the word of their testimony;
> they did not love their lives
> even unto death.

## Revelation 12:12

> Therefore rejoice, you heavens and you who dwell in them!
> But woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has come down to you with great wrath,
> knowing that he has only a short time.”

## Revelation 12:13

When the dragon saw that he had been cast down to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child.

## Revelation 12:14

The woman was given the two wings of a great eagle, so that she might fly to the place prepared for her in the wilderness, where she would be nourished for a time, times, and half a time, away from the serpent's presence.

## Revelation 12:15

Then the serpent spewed water like a river out of his mouth after the woman, so that he might cause her to be swept away with the flood.

## Revelation 12:16

But the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river which the dragon had spewed out of his mouth.

## Revelation 12:17

Then the dragon was enraged with the woman and went off to make war with the rest of her offspring, those who keep the commandments of God and hold fast their testimony about Jesus.
