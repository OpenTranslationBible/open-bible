# Revelation Chapter 13

## Revelation 13:1

The dragon stood on the sands of the seashore. And I saw a beast rising out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, with ten crowns on its horns, and on its heads were blasphemous names.

## Revelation 13:2

The beast I saw was like a leopard, with feet like those of a bear, and a mouth like that of a lion. The dragon bestowed upon it his power, his throne, and great authority.

## Revelation 13:3

One of its heads appeared as though it had been mortally wounded, yet its fatal wound was healed. The entire earth was filled with awe and followed the beast.

## Revelation 13:4

They worshipped the dragon for giving authority to the beast; and they also worshipped the beast, saying, “Who is like the beast, and who can wage war against it?”

## Revelation 13:5

It was granted a mouth to speak arrogant words and blasphemies, and it was given authority to act for forty-two months.

## Revelation 13:6

It opened its mouth to blaspheme against God, to slander His name and His dwelling place, and those who dwell in heaven.

## Revelation 13:7

It was permitted to wage war against the saints and to overcome them, and it was given authority over every tribe, people, language, and nation.

## Revelation 13:8

All who dwell on the earth will worship it, all whose names have not been written in the Lamb’s book of life, the Lamb who was slain from the foundation of the world.

## Revelation 13:9

If anyone has an ear, let them hear.

## Revelation 13:10

> “If anyone is destined for captivity,
> into captivity they will go;
> if anyone kills with the sword,
> with the sword they must be killed.”

This calls for the perseverance and faith of the saints.

## Revelation 13:11

Then I saw another beast coming up from the earth; it had two horns like a lamb, but it spoke like a dragon.

## Revelation 13:12

It exercised all the authority of the first beast on its behalf, and made the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was healed.

## Revelation 13:13

It performed great signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to the earth in full view of the people.

## Revelation 13:14

Because of the signs it was given power to perform on behalf of the first beast, it deceived those who dwell on the earth. It instructed them to set up an image in honour of the beast who had the wound of the sword and yet lived.

## Revelation 13:15

It was granted power to give breath to the image of the beast, so that the image could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed.

## Revelation 13:16

It compelled all people, small and great, rich and poor, free and enslaved, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads,

## Revelation 13:17

so that no one could buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name.

## Revelation 13:18

Here is wisdom. Let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. That number is 666.
