# Revelation Chapter 14

## Revelation 14:1
Then I looked, and behold, the Lamb was standing on Mount Zion, and with Him were 144,000 having His name and His Father's name inscribed on their foreheads.

## Revelation 14:2
And I heard a sound from heaven, like the roar of many waters and like the peal of loud thunder. The sound I heard was like harpists playing their harps.

## Revelation 14:3
And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders; and no one could learn the song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth.

## Revelation 14:4
These are the ones who have not defiled themselves with women, for they are celibate. They follow the Lamb wherever He goes. They have been purchased from among mankind as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb.

## Revelation 14:5
No falsehood was found in their mouths; they are without fault.

## Revelation 14:6
Then I saw another angel flying in midheaven, having an eternal gospel to proclaim to those who dwell on the earth—to every nation, tribe, language, and people.

## Revelation 14:7
And he said with a loud voice, “Fear God and give Him glory, because the hour of His judgement has come. Worship Him who made the heavens, the earth, the sea, and the springs of water.”

## Revelation 14:8
And another angel, a second one, followed, saying, “Fallen, fallen is Babylon the Great, she who made all the nations drink of the wine of the passion of her immorality.”

## Revelation 14:9
Then another angel, a third one, followed them, saying with a loud voice, “If anyone worships the beast and its image, and receives a mark on their forehead or on their hand,

## Revelation 14:10
they too will drink of the wine of God's wrath, which is poured full strength into the cup of His anger. They will be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb.

## Revelation 14:11
And the smoke of their torment ascends for ever and ever; they have no rest day or night, those who worship the beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark of its name.”

## Revelation 14:12
Here is the endurance of the saints who keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus.

## Revelation 14:13
And I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Write: ‘Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.’” “Yes,” says the Spirit, “so that they may rest from their labours, for their deeds follow with them.”

## Revelation 14:14
Then I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and seated on the cloud was someone resembling a son of man, with a golden crown on His head and a sharp sickle in His hand.

## Revelation 14:15
And another angel came out of the temple, calling with a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, “Put in Your sickle and reap, for the time to reap has come, because the harvest of the earth is ripe.”

## Revelation 14:16
So He who sat on the cloud swung His sickle over the earth, and the earth was reaped.

## Revelation 14:17
And another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he also had a sharp sickle.

## Revelation 14:18
Then another angel, the one with authority over fire, emerged from the altar, and he called with a loud voice to the one who had the sharp sickle, saying, “Put in your sharp sickle and gather the clusters from the vine of the earth, because her grapes are ripe.”

## Revelation 14:19
So the angel swung his sickle to the earth and gathered the clusters from the vine of the earth, and threw them into the great winepress of God's wrath.

## Revelation 14:20
And the winepress was trodden outside the city, and blood flowed out from the winepress, up to the horses’ bridles, for a distance of 1,600 stadia.
