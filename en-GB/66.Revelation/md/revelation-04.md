# Revelation Chapter 4

## Revelation 4:1

After these events I looked, and there was a door standing open in heaven. The first voice I heard, which sounded like a trumpet, said, “Come up here, and I will show you what must happen after these things.”

## Revelation 4:2

Immediately I was in the Spirit, and there was a throne set in heaven, with someone seated on it.

## Revelation 4:3

The one who sat there had an appearance like jasper and sardius, and a rainbow resembling an emerald encircled the throne.

## Revelation 4:4

Surrounding the throne were twenty-four thrones, and upon these thrones sat twenty-four elders, dressed in white garments, with golden crowns on their heads.

## Revelation 4:5

From the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings, and peals of thunder. In front of the throne, seven lamps were burning, which are the seven spirits of God.

## Revelation 4:6

Before the throne there was something like a sea of glass, clear as crystal; and in the centre, around the throne, were four living creatures covered with eyes, in front and behind.

## Revelation 4:7

The first living creature was like a lion, the second was like a calf, the third had a face like a man, and the fourth was like a flying eagle.

## Revelation 4:8

Each of the four living creatures had six wings and were full of eyes all around and within; and day and night they never cease to say,

> “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty,
> who was, and is, and is to come.”

## Revelation 4:9

Whenever the living creatures give glory, honour, and thanks to the one who sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever,

## Revelation 4:10

the twenty-four elders fall down before the one who sits on the throne and worship him who lives forever and ever. They lay their crowns before the throne and say:

## Revelation 4:11

> “You are worthy, our Lord and God,
> to receive glory, honour, and power,
> for you created all things,
> and by your will they existed and were created.”
