# Revelation Chapter 9

## Revelation 9:1
The fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from heaven to the earth. To him was given the key to the shaft of the Abyss.

## Revelation 9:2
He opened the shaft of the Abyss, and smoke rose from it like the smoke of a vast furnace. The sun and the air were darkened by the smoke from the shaft.

## Revelation 9:3
Out of the smoke came locusts upon the earth, and they were given power like that of scorpions of the earth.

## Revelation 9:4
They were instructed not to harm the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree, but only those people who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads.

## Revelation 9:5
They were not allowed to kill them, but only to torment them for five months. The torment they inflicted was like that of a scorpion when it stings a person.

## Revelation 9:6
In those days, people will seek death but will not find it; they will long to die, but death will evade them.

## Revelation 9:7
The locusts appeared like horses prepared for battle. On their heads were something like crowns of gold, and their faces resembled human faces.

## Revelation 9:8
Their hair was like women’s hair, and their teeth were like those of lions.

## Revelation 9:9
They had breastplates like iron breastplates, and the sound of their wings was like the noise of many horses and chariots rushing into battle.

## Revelation 9:10
They had tails with stingers like scorpions, and in their tails they possessed the power to torment people for five months.

## Revelation 9:11
They had as king over them the angel of the Abyss, whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek, Apollyon.

## Revelation 9:12
The first woe is past; behold, two more woes are yet to come.

## Revelation 9:13
The sixth angel sounded his trumpet, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar before God,

## Revelation 9:14
saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, “Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.”

## Revelation 9:15
The four angels, who had been prepared for the hour, day, month, and year, were released to kill a third of mankind.

## Revelation 9:16
The number of the mounted troops was two hundred million; I heard their number.

## Revelation 9:17
This is how I saw the horses and riders in my vision: the riders had breastplates of fiery red, dark blue, and sulphurous yellow. The heads of the horses were like the heads of lions, and out of their mouths came fire, smoke, and sulphur.

## Revelation 9:18
A third of mankind was killed by these three plagues of fire, smoke, and sulphur coming out of their mouths.

## Revelation 9:19
The power of the horses was in their mouths and in their tails; for their tails were like serpents, having heads with which they inflicted harm.

## Revelation 9:20
The rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, still did not repent of the works of their hands; they did not cease worshipping demons, and idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood, which cannot see, hear, or walk.

## Revelation 9:21
Nor did they repent of their murders, their sorceries, their sexual immorality, or their thefts.
