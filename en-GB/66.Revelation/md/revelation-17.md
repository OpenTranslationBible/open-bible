# Revelation Chapter 17

## Revelation 17:1

One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke to me, saying, “Come, I will show you the judgement of the great prostitute who sits upon many waters,

## Revelation 17:2

with whom the kings of the earth committed acts of immorality, and the inhabitants of the earth became intoxicated with the wine of her immorality.”

## Revelation 17:3

Then he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness, and there I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast full of blasphemous names, with seven heads and ten horns.

## Revelation 17:4

The woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold, precious stones, and pearls. She held a golden cup in her hand, filled with abominations and the filth of her immorality.

## Revelation 17:5

On her forehead a name was written, a mystery:

“BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF PROSTITUTES AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.”

## Revelation 17:6

I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. When I saw her, I was greatly amazed.

## Revelation 17:7

Then the angel said to me, “Why are you amazed? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns.

## Revelation 17:8

The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to ascend from the abyss and go to destruction. The inhabitants of the earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world will be amazed when they see the beast, because it was, and is not, and will come.

## Revelation 17:9

This calls for a mind with wisdom. The seven heads are seven hills upon which the woman sits.

## Revelation 17:10

They are also seven kings; five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; but when he does come, he must remain for a short time.

## Revelation 17:11

The beast which was, and is not, is also an eighth king, and belongs to the seven, and he goes to destruction.

## Revelation 17:12

The ten horns you saw represent ten kings who have not yet received their kingdoms, but they will be granted authority as kings alongside the beast for a brief period.

## Revelation 17:13

These have one purpose and will give their power and authority to the beast.

## Revelation 17:14

They will wage war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will overcome them because he is Lord of lords and King of kings; and with him will be his called, chosen, and faithful followers.”

## Revelation 17:15

And he said to me, “The waters you saw, where the prostitute sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages.

## Revelation 17:16

The ten horns you saw, and the beast, will hate the prostitute. They will make her desolate and naked, eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.

## Revelation 17:17

For God has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose by having a common purpose and by giving their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God are fulfilled.

## Revelation 17:18

The woman you saw is the great city that reigns over the kings of the earth.”
