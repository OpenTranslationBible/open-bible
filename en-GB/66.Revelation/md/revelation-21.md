# Revelation Chapter 21

## Revelation 21:1

I observed a renewed heaven and a renewed earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea.

## Revelation 21:2

I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.

## Revelation 21:3

And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Behold, the dwelling place of God is now among the people, and He will dwell with them. They will be His people, and God Himself will be with them and be their God.

## Revelation 21:4

He will wipe every tear from their eyes, and there will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the former things have passed away.”

## Revelation 21:5

He who was seated on the throne said, “Behold, I am making all things new!” Then He said, “Write this down, for these words are faithful and true.”

## Revelation 21:6

He said to me, “It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To the one who is thirsty, I will give freely from the spring of the water of life.

## Revelation 21:7

The one who is victorious will inherit these things, and I will be their God and they will be My children.

## Revelation 21:8

But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the abominable, murderers, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulphur. This is the second death.”

## Revelation 21:9

Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and spoke with me, saying, “Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.”

## Revelation 21:10

And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.

## Revelation 21:11

It shone with the glory of God, and its radiance was like a very precious stone, like a jasper, clear as crystal.

## Revelation 21:12

It had a great and high wall with twelve gates, and at the gates were twelve angels. On the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel.

## Revelation 21:13

There were three gates on the east, three on the north, three on the south, and three on the west.

## Revelation 21:14

The city's wall had twelve foundations, and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.

## Revelation 21:15

The angel who spoke with me had a golden measuring rod to measure the city, its gates, and its wall.

## Revelation 21:16

The city was laid out as a square, its length equal to its width. He measured the city with the rod and found it to be twelve thousand stadia in length, and its length, width, and height were equal.

## Revelation 21:17

He measured its wall, and it was 144 cubits thick by human measurement, which is also angelic measurement.

## Revelation 21:18

The wall was made of jasper, and the city was of pure gold, like clear glass.

## Revelation 21:19

The foundations of the city walls were adorned with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald,

## Revelation 21:20

the fifth was made of onyx, the sixth of carnelian, the seventh of chrysolite, the eighth of beryl, the ninth of topaz, the tenth of chrysoprase, the eleventh of jacinth, and the twelfth of amethyst.

## Revelation 21:21

The twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate made of a single pearl. The main street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.

## Revelation 21:22

I did not find a temple in the city, because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.

## Revelation 21:23

The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God illuminates it, and the Lamb is its lamp.

## Revelation 21:24

The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it.

## Revelation 21:25

Its gates will always remain open during the day, for there will be no night there.

## Revelation 21:26

The honour and splendour of the nations will be brought into it.

## Revelation 21:27

Nothing unclean will ever enter it, nor anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb’s book of life.
