# Revelation Chapter 1

## Revelation 1:1

The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God granted Him to show to His servants the things that must soon occur. He made it known by sending His angel to His servant John,

## Revelation 1:2

who bore witness to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, to everything he saw.

## Revelation 1:3

Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear and keep what is written in it, for the time is near.

## Revelation 1:4

John, to the seven churches in the province of Asia: Grace and peace to you from Him who is, who was, and who is to come, and from the seven spirits before His throne,

## Revelation 1:5

and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To Him who loves us and has released us from our sins by His blood—

## Revelation 1:6

and has made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father—to Him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

## Revelation 1:7

> Behold, He is coming with the clouds,
> and every eye will see Him,
> even those who pierced Him;
> and all the tribes of the earth will mourn because of Him.
> So shall it be! Amen.

## Revelation 1:8

“I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “who is, who was, and who is to come, the Almighty.”

## Revelation 1:9

I, John, your brother and companion in the tribulation and kingdom and patient endurance in Jesus, was on the island of Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.

## Revelation 1:10

I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s Day, and I heard a loud voice behind me, resonant like a trumpet,

## Revelation 1:11

instructing me to write what I see on a scroll and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.

## Revelation 1:12

Then I turned to see the voice that was speaking to me. And having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands,

## Revelation 1:13

and in the midst of the lampstands was one like a son of man, clothed in a robe reaching to His feet, and with a golden sash around His chest.

## Revelation 1:14

His head and hair were white like wool, as white as snow, and His eyes were like a flame of fire.

## Revelation 1:15

His feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace, and His voice was like the sound of many waters.

## Revelation 1:16

In His right hand He held seven stars, and out of His mouth came a sharp, double-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining in its full strength.

## Revelation 1:17

Upon seeing Him, I fell at His feet as if lifeless. Then He placed His right hand on me and said: “Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last,

## Revelation 1:18

and the Living One; I was dead, and behold, I am alive for evermore, and I hold the keys of death and Hades.

## Revelation 1:19

Write, therefore, what you have seen, what is now, and what will take place after these things.

## Revelation 1:20

Regarding the seven stars you saw in My right hand and the seven golden lampstands: The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.
