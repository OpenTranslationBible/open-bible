# Revelation Chapter 20

## Revelation 20:1
I saw an angel descending from heaven, holding the key to the Abyss and a great chain in his hand.

## Revelation 20:2
He captured the dragon, that ancient serpent, known as the devil and Satan, and restrained him for a thousand years.

## Revelation 20:3
He cast him into the Abyss, shut it, and sealed it over him, to prevent him from deceiving the nations any longer until the thousand years were fulfilled. After this, he must be released for a short period.

## Revelation 20:4
I saw thrones, and those seated on them were given authority to judge. I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their testimony of Jesus and the word of God, and those who had not worshipped the beast or its image nor received its mark on their foreheads or hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.

## Revelation 20:5
The remainder of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were fulfilled. This marks the first resurrection.

## Revelation 20:6
Blessed and holy are those who share in the first resurrection. The second death has no authority over them, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and will reign with Him for a thousand years.

## Revelation 20:7
Once the thousand years have concluded, Satan will be released from his prison,

## Revelation 20:8
and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for battle. Their number is like the sand on the seashore.

## Revelation 20:9
They marched across the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of God's people and the beloved city. But fire descended from heaven and consumed them.

## Revelation 20:10
The devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet were also, and they will be tormented day and night for ever and ever.

## Revelation 20:11
Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it. From His presence, earth and heaven fled away, and no place was found for them.

## Revelation 20:12
I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged according to what was written in the books, according to their deeds.

## Revelation 20:13
The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and Death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and each person was judged according to their deeds.

## Revelation 20:14
Then Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This lake of fire represents the second death.

## Revelation 20:15
Anyone whose name was not found in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.
