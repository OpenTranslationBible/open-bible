## Revelation 22:1
The angel showed me the river of the water of life, clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb,

## Revelation 22:2
down the middle of the city's street. On either side of the river was the tree of life, bearing twelve varieties of fruit, yielding its fruit each month; and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.

## Revelation 22:3
There will no longer be any curse. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city, and His servants will serve Him.

## Revelation 22:4
They will behold His face, and His name will be inscribed on their foreheads.

## Revelation 22:5
There will no longer be any night. They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, for the Lord God will illuminate them. And they will reign for ever and ever.

## Revelation 22:6
The angel said to me, “These words are trustworthy and true. The Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent His angel to show His servants the things that must soon take place.”

## Revelation 22:7
“Behold, I am coming soon! Blessed is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.”

## Revelation 22:8
I, John, am the one who witnessed these things. And upon hearing and seeing them, I bowed down to worship at the feet of the angel who revealed them to me.

## Revelation 22:9
But he said to me, “Do not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers the prophets, and with those who keep the words of this book. Worship God!”

## Revelation 22:10
Then he said to me, “Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, because the time is near.

## Revelation 22:11
Let the one who does wrong continue to do wrong; let the vile person continue to be vile; let the one who is righteous continue to do right; and let the holy person continue to be holy.”

## Revelation 22:12
“Behold, I am coming soon, and My reward is with Me, to give to each person according to what they have done.

## Revelation 22:13
I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.”

Outside are those who engage in sorcery, immorality, murder, idolatry, and all who love and practice deceit.

## Revelation 22:16
“I, Jesus, have sent My angel to testify to you of these things for the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the bright Morning Star.”

## Revelation 22:17
The Spirit and the bride say, “Come.” And let the one who hears say, “Come.” Let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who desires take the water of life freely.

## Revelation 22:18
I caution everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to that person the plagues described in this book.

## Revelation 22:19
And if anyone removes from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will remove that person's share in the tree of life and in the Holy City, which are described in this book.

## Revelation 22:20
The one who bears witness to these things says, “Yes, I am coming soon.” Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.

## Revelation 22:21
May the grace of the Lord Jesus be with all. Amen.
