# Revelation Chapter 15

## Revelation 15:1

I saw another great and marvellous sign in heaven: seven angels with the seven last plagues, for with them God’s wrath is completed.

## Revelation 15:2

And I saw something resembling a sea of glass mingled with fire, and those who had triumphed over the beast, its image, and the number of its name, standing on the sea of glass, holding harps given by God.

## Revelation 15:3

And they sang the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying,

> “Great and marvellous are your deeds,
> Lord God Almighty;
> just and true are your ways,
> King of the nations.

## Revelation 15:4

> Who will not fear you, Lord, and glorify your name?
> For you alone are holy.
> All nations will come and worship before you,
> for your righteous acts have been revealed.”

## Revelation 15:5

After this I looked, and the temple of the tabernacle of testimony in heaven was opened.

## Revelation 15:6

The seven angels with the seven plagues came out of the temple, clothed in clean, bright linen, with golden sashes around their chests.

## Revelation 15:7

One of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls filled with the wrath of God, who lives for ever and ever.

## Revelation 15:8

The temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power, and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.
