# Revelation Chapter 8

## Revelation 8:1
When the Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.

## Revelation 8:2
And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.

## Revelation 8:3
Another angel, holding a golden censer, came and stood at the altar. He was given much incense to offer, along with the prayers of all the saints, on the golden altar before the throne.

## Revelation 8:4
The smoke of the incense, together with the prayers of the saints, rose up before God from the angel's hand.

## Revelation 8:5
Then the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and hurled it onto the earth; and there were peals of thunder, rumblings, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.

## Revelation 8:6
And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to sound them.

## Revelation 8:7
The first angel sounded his trumpet, and there was hail and fire mixed with blood, and it was thrown to the earth; a third of the earth was burned up, a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.

## Revelation 8:8
The second angel sounded his trumpet, and something like a great mountain, burning with fire, was cast into the sea; and a third of the sea turned into blood,

## Revelation 8:9
and a third of the sea creatures perished, and a third of the ships were destroyed.

## Revelation 8:10
The third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star, burning like a torch, fell from heaven onto a third of the rivers and on the springs of water—

## Revelation 8:11
the star is called Wormwood. A third of the waters became bitter, and many people died from the waters because they had become bitter.

## Revelation 8:12
The fourth angel sounded his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them were darkened. A third of the day did not shine, and likewise the night.

## Revelation 8:13
Then I looked, and I heard an eagle flying in mid-heaven, proclaiming with a loud voice, “Woe, woe, woe to the inhabitants of the earth, because of the trumpet blasts about to be sounded by the remaining three angels!”
