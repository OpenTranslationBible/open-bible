# Revelation Chapter 7

## Revelation 7:1

After this, I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, restraining the four winds of the earth so that no wind might blow on the land, the sea, or any tree.

## Revelation 7:2

And I saw another angel ascending from the east, carrying the seal of the living God. He called out in a loud voice to the four angels who were granted the power to harm the earth and the sea,

## Revelation 7:3

saying, “Do not harm the earth, the sea, or the trees until we have placed a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God.”

## Revelation 7:4

And I heard the number of those who were sealed: 144,000, sealed from all the tribes of the sons of Israel:

## Revelation 7:5

> Sealed from the tribe of Judah, 12,000,
> from the tribe of Reuben, 12,000,
> from the tribe of Gad, 12,000,

## Revelation 7:6

> from the tribe of Asher, 12,000,
> from the tribe of Naphtali, 12,000,
> from the tribe of Manasseh, 12,000,

## Revelation 7:7

> from the tribe of Simeon, 12,000,
> from the tribe of Levi, 12,000,
> from the tribe of Issachar, 12,000,

## Revelation 7:8

> from the tribe of Zebulun, 12,000,
> from the tribe of Joseph, 12,000,
> and from the tribe of Benjamin, 12,000 were sealed.

## Revelation 7:9

After these events, I looked, and there was a vast multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people, and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands.

## Revelation 7:10

And they proclaimed with a loud voice,

> “Salvation is attributed to our God
> who sits on the throne,
> and to the Lamb.”

## Revelation 7:11

All the angels were standing around the throne, the elders, and the four living creatures; and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshipped God,

## Revelation 7:12

saying,

> “Amen!
> Blessing, glory,
> wisdom, thanksgiving, honour,
> power, and might
> be to our God forever and ever.
> Amen.”

## Revelation 7:13

Then one of the elders addressed me, asking, “These who are dressed in white robes, who are they, and where have they come from?”

## Revelation 7:14

I replied, “Sir, you know.” And he said to me, “These are the ones who have come out of the great tribulation, and they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.

## Revelation 7:15

> For this reason, they are before the throne of God
> and serve Him day and night in His temple;
> and He who sits on the throne will shelter them with His presence.

## Revelation 7:16

> They will no longer hunger or thirst,
> nor will the sun beat down on them, nor any scorching heat;

## Revelation 7:17

> for the Lamb in the midst of the throne will be their shepherd,
> and He will lead them to springs of the water of life;
> and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.”
