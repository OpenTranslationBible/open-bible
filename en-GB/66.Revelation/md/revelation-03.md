# Revelation Chapter 3

## Revelation 3:1
“To the angel of the church in Sardis write: These are the words of the one who possesses the seven spirits of God and the seven stars. I am aware of your deeds; you have a reputation for being alive, yet you are dead.

## Revelation 3:2
Be vigilant and strengthen what remains, which is on the verge of dying, for I have found your deeds incomplete in the sight of my God.

## Revelation 3:3
So remember what you have received and heard; hold it firmly, and repent. If you do not remain alert, I will come like a thief, and you will not know the hour I will come to you.

## Revelation 3:4
However, you have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their garments. They will walk with me, dressed in white, for they are worthy.

## Revelation 3:5
The one who is victorious will be clothed in white garments like them, and I will not erase their name from the book of life, but will acknowledge their name before my Father and his angels.

## Revelation 3:6
Whoever has an ear, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.

## Revelation 3:7
“To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: These are the words of the one who is holy and true, who holds the key of David. What he opens no one can shut, and what he shuts no one can open.

## Revelation 3:8
I know your deeds. Look, I have set before you an open door that no one can shut. You have a little strength, yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name.

## Revelation 3:9
I will make those who belong to the synagogue of Satan, who claim to be Jews but are not, and are liars—I will make them come and bow down at your feet and acknowledge that I have loved you.

## Revelation 3:10
Because you have kept my command to persevere, I will also keep you from the hour of trial that is about to come upon the whole world to test the inhabitants of the earth.

## Revelation 3:11
I am coming soon. Hold fast to what you have, so that no one will take your crown.

## Revelation 3:12
The one who is victorious I will make a pillar in the temple of my God, and they will never leave it. I will write on them the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which is coming down out of heaven from my God; and I will also write on them my new name.

## Revelation 3:13
Whoever has an ear, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.

## Revelation 3:14
“To the angel of the church in Laodicea write: These are the words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the origin of God’s creation.

## Revelation 3:15
I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either cold or hot!

## Revelation 3:16
So, because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—I am about to spit you out of my mouth.

## Revelation 3:17
You say, ‘I am rich; I have acquired wealth and do not need anything.’ But you do not realise that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked.

## Revelation 3:18
I advise you to buy from me gold refined in the fire, so you can become rich; and white garments to wear, so you can cover your shameful nakedness; and salve to put on your eyes, so you can see.

## Revelation 3:19
Those whom I love, I rebuke and discipline. Therefore, be earnest and repent.

## Revelation 3:20
Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and dine with that person, and they with me.

## Revelation 3:21
To the one who is victorious, I will grant the right to sit with me on my throne, just as I was victorious and sat down with my Father on his throne.

## Revelation 3:22
Whoever has an ear, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.”
