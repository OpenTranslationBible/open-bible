# Revelation Chapter 2

## Revelation 2:1
“To the angel of the church in Ephesus write: These are the words of the One who holds the seven stars in His right hand and walks among the seven golden lampstands.

## Revelation 2:2
I know your deeds, your labour, and your perseverance, and that you cannot tolerate evil people. You have tested those who claim to be apostles but are not, and have found them false.

## Revelation 2:3
You have endured and persevered for my name, and have not grown weary.

## Revelation 2:4
Yet I have this against you: You have abandoned the love you had at first.

## Revelation 2:5
Remember from where you have fallen! Repent and do the deeds you did at first. If you do not repent, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place.

## Revelation 2:6
But you have this in your favour: You hate the practices of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.

## Revelation 2:7
Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who is victorious, I will grant the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God.

## Revelation 2:8
“To the angel of the church in Smyrna write: These are the words of the First and the Last, who was dead and has come to life.

## Revelation 2:9
I know your tribulation and your poverty—yet you are rich! I know about the slander of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.

## Revelation 2:10
Do not fear what you are about to suffer. The devil is about to throw some of you into prison, so that you will be tested, and you will have tribulation for ten days. Be faithful even unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.

## Revelation 2:11
Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. The one who is victorious will not be harmed by the second death.

## Revelation 2:12
“To the angel of the church in Pergamum write: These are the words of Him who has the sharp, double-edged sword.

## Revelation 2:13
I know where you live—where Satan's throne is. Yet you hold firmly to my name and did not deny your faith in me, even in the days of Antipas, my faithful witness, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells.

## Revelation 2:14
But I have a few things against you: There are some among you who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the Israelites, to eat food sacrificed to idols and to commit sexual immorality.

## Revelation 2:15
In the same way, you also have those who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.

## Revelation 2:16
Repent therefore! Otherwise, I will come to you quickly and fight against them with the sword of my mouth.

## Revelation 2:17
Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who is victorious, I will give some of the hidden manna. I will also give that person a white stone with a new name written on it, known only to the one who receives it.

## Revelation 2:18
“To the angel of the church in Thyatira write: These are the words of the Son of God, whose eyes are like blazing fire and whose feet are like burnished bronze.

## Revelation 2:19
I know your deeds, your love and faith, your service and perseverance, and that your deeds of late are greater than at first.

## Revelation 2:20
Nevertheless, I have this against you: You tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess. By her teaching she misleads my servants into sexual immorality and the eating of food sacrificed to idols.

## Revelation 2:21
I have given her time to repent of her immorality, but she is unwilling.

## Revelation 2:22
Behold, I will cast her on a bed of suffering, and those who commit adultery with her will suffer intensely, unless they repent of her ways.

## Revelation 2:23
I will strike her children dead. Then all the churches will know that I am He who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds.

## Revelation 2:24
Now I say to the rest of you in Thyatira, to you who do not hold to her teaching and have not learned Satan’s so-called deep secrets, I will not impose any other burden on you,

## Revelation 2:25
except to hold on to what you have until I come.

## Revelation 2:26
To the one who is victorious and does my will to the end, I will give authority over the nations—

## Revelation 2:27
that one ‘will rule them with a rod of iron and will dash them to pieces like pottery’—just as I have received authority from my Father.

## Revelation 2:28
I will also give that one the morning star.

## Revelation 2:29
Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
