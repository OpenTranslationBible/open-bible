# Revelation Chapter 18

## Revelation 18:1

After this I saw another angel descending from heaven, possessing great authority, and the earth was illuminated by his glory.

## Revelation 18:2

He cried out with a powerful voice, saying,

> “Fallen, fallen is Babylon the Great!
> She has become a dwelling for demons
> and a prison for every impure spirit,
> a prison for every unclean and detestable bird.

## Revelation 18:3

> For all the nations have drunk the wine of the passion of her immorality,
> and the kings of the earth have committed acts of immorality with her,
> and the merchants of the earth have grown rich from the excess of her luxury.”

## Revelation 18:4

Then I heard another voice from heaven, saying,

> “Come out of her, my people,
> so that you will not partake in her sins
> and receive any of her plagues;

## Revelation 18:5

> for her sins have reached up to heaven,
> and God has remembered her iniquities.

## Revelation 18:6

> Render to her as she has rendered;
> repay her double according to her deeds.
> In the cup she has mixed, mix for her a double portion.

## Revelation 18:7

> To the degree that she glorified herself and lived in luxury,
> give her torment and mourning in equal measure.
> For she says in her heart, ‘I sit as a queen, I am not a widow, and I will never see mourning.’

## Revelation 18:8

> Therefore, in one day her plagues will come:
> death, mourning, and famine.
> She will be consumed by fire,
> for mighty is the Lord God who judges her.

## Revelation 18:9

“And the kings of the earth, who committed acts of immorality and lived in luxury with her, will weep and mourn over her when they see the smoke of her burning,

## Revelation 18:10

standing at a distance due to the fear of her torment, saying,

> ‘Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the strong city!
> For in one hour your judgment has come.’

## Revelation 18:11

“And the merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her, because no one buys their cargo any more—

## Revelation 18:12

cargo of gold, silver, precious stones, and pearls; fine linen, purple, silk, and scarlet; every kind of citron wood, every article of ivory, and every article made from costly wood, bronze, iron, and marble;

## Revelation 18:13

cinnamon, spice, incense, myrrh, frankincense, wine, olive oil, fine flour, wheat, cattle, sheep, horses, carriages, and human beings sold as slaves.

## Revelation 18:14

They will say, ‘The fruit you longed for has departed from you. All your luxury and splendour have vanished, never to be found again.’

## Revelation 18:15

The merchants who became rich from her will stand at a distance due to the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning,

## Revelation 18:16

and saying,

> ‘Woe, woe, the great city,
> dressed in fine linen, purple, and scarlet,
> and adorned with gold, precious stones, and pearls;

## Revelation 18:17

for in one hour such great wealth has been laid waste!’ Every shipmaster, every passenger, sailor, and all who make their living by the sea will stand at a distance,

## Revelation 18:18

and will cry out as they see the smoke of her burning, saying, ‘What city is like the great city?’

## Revelation 18:19

They will throw dust on their heads and cry out, weeping and mourning, saying,

> ‘Woe, woe, the great city,
> where all who had ships at sea became rich from her wealth!
> For in one hour she has been laid waste!’

## Revelation 18:20

> “Rejoice over her, O heavens, and you saints, apostles, and prophets,
> for God has pronounced judgment for you against her.”

## Revelation 18:21

Then a mighty angel picked up a stone like a large millstone and threw it into the sea, saying,

> “With such violence Babylon, the great city,
> will be thrown down, never to be found again.

## Revelation 18:22

> The sound of harpists, musicians, flute players, and trumpeters
> will never be heard in you again.
> No craftsman of any trade will ever be found in you again.
> The sound of a millstone will never be heard in you again.

## Revelation 18:23

> The light of a lamp
> will never shine in you again.
> The voice of the bridegroom and bride
> will never be heard in you again.
> Your merchants were the world's powerful people.
> By your sorcery all the nations were led astray.

## Revelation 18:24

> And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints,
> and of all who have been slaughtered on the earth.”
