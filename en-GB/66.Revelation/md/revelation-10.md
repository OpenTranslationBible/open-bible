# Revelation Chapter 10

## Revelation 10:1
I saw another mighty angel descending from heaven, clothed in a cloud, with a rainbow over his head. His face shone like the sun, and his legs were like pillars of fire.

## Revelation 10:2
In his hand was a small scroll, lying open. He set his right foot on the sea and his left on the land.

## Revelation 10:3
He cried out with a loud voice, as a lion roars, and when he cried out, the voices of the seven thunders spoke.

## Revelation 10:4
When the seven thunders had spoken, I was about to write, but I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Seal up what the seven thunders have spoken and do not write it down.”

## Revelation 10:5
Then the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted his right hand to heaven,

## Revelation 10:6
and swore by Him who lives for ever and ever, who created the heavens and everything in them, the earth and everything in it, and the sea and everything in it, that there would be no more delay,

## Revelation 10:7
but in the days when the seventh angel is about to sound his trumpet, the mystery of God will be completed, as He announced to His servants the prophets.

## Revelation 10:8
Then the voice I had heard from heaven spoke to me again, saying, “Go, take the scroll that is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land.”

## Revelation 10:9
So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the small scroll. He said to me, “Take it and eat it; it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey.”

## Revelation 10:10
I took the small scroll from the angel’s hand and ate it. It was as sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it, my stomach turned bitter.

## Revelation 10:11
Then I was told, “You must prophesy again concerning many peoples, nations, languages, and kings.”
