# Revelation Chapter 10

## Revelation 10:1

I saw another strong angel coming down out of heaven, clothed with a cloud; and the rainbow was on his head, and his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire;

## Revelation 10:2

and he had in his hand a little scroll, opened. He placed his right foot on the sea and his left on the land;

## Revelation 10:3

and he cried out with a loud voice, as when a lion roars; and when he had cried out, the seven peals of thunder uttered their voices.

## Revelation 10:4

When the seven peals of thunder had spoken, I was about to write; and I heard a voice from heaven, saying, “Seal up the things which the seven peals of thunder have spoken, and do not write them.”

## Revelation 10:5

Then the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven,

## Revelation 10:6

and swore by Him who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and the things in it, and the earth and the things in it, and the sea and the things in it, that there will no longer be a delay,

## Revelation 10:7

but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, then the mystery of God is finished, as He announced to His servants, the prophets.

## Revelation 10:8

Then the voice which I heard from heaven, I heard again speaking with me, and saying, “Go, take the scroll which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land.”

## Revelation 10:9

So I went to the angel, telling him to give me the little scroll. And he said to me, “Take it and eat it; it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey.”

## Revelation 10:10

I took the little scroll from the angel’s hand and ate it, and in my mouth it was sweet as honey; and when I had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter.

## Revelation 10:11

And they said to me, “You must prophesy again concerning many peoples, nations, languages, and kings.”
