# Hosea Chapter 3

## Hosea 3:1
The Lord spoke to me, “Go once more and show love to a woman who is loved by another and is unfaithful, just as the Lord loves the people of Israel, even though they turn to other gods and delight in raisin cakes.”

## Hosea 3:2
So I acquired her for myself for fifteen shekels of silver and a homer and a lethek of barley.

## Hosea 3:3
I said to her, “You must stay with me for many days. You shall not be a prostitute or be with any other man, and I will act the same towards you.”

## Hosea 3:4
For the people of Israel will remain for many days without a king or prince, without sacrifice or memorial stones, and without ephod or household idols.

## Hosea 3:5
Afterwards, the people of Israel will return and seek the Lord their God and David their king. They will approach the Lord with reverence and seek His blessings in the latter days.
