## Hosea 1:1

The word of the Lord which came to Hosea the son of Beeri, during the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and during the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel:

When the Lord first spoke through Hosea, the Lord said to Hosea, “Go, take for yourself a wife of prostitution and have children of prostitution; for the land commits flagrant prostitution, abandoning the Lord.”

## Hosea 1:3

So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son.

## Hosea 1:4

And the Lord said to him, “Name him Jezreel; for in just a little while, I will punish the house of Jehu for the bloodshed of Jezreel, and I will put an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel.

## Hosea 1:5

On that day, I will break the bow of Israel in the Valley of Jezreel.”

## Hosea 1:6

Then she conceived again and gave birth to a daughter. And the Lord said to him, “Name her Lo-ruhamah, for I will no longer take pity on the house of Israel, that I would ever forgive them.

## Hosea 1:7

But I will take pity on the house of Judah and save them by the Lord their God, and will not save them by bow, sword, battle, horses, or horsemen.”

## Hosea 1:8

When she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived and gave birth to a son.

## Hosea 1:9

And the Lord said, “Name him Lo-ammi, because you are not My people, and I am not your God.”

## Hosea 1:10

Yet the number of the sons of Israel  
Will be like the sand of the sea,  
Which cannot be measured or counted;  
And in the place  
Where it is said to them,  
“You are not My people,”  
It will be said to them,  
“You are the sons of the living God.”

## Hosea 1:11

And the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel will be gathered together,  
And they will appoint for themselves one leader,  
And they will go up from the land,  
For great will be the day of Jezreel.
