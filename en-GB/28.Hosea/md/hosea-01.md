## Hosea 1:1
The word of the Lord that came to Hosea son of Beeri during the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and during the days of Jeroboam son of Joash, king of Israel.

## Hosea 1:2
When the Lord began to speak through Hosea, He said to him, “Go, take for yourself a wife of infidelity and have children of infidelity, for the land is guilty of unfaithfulness in departing from the Lord.”

## Hosea 1:3
So he went and took Gomer daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son.

## Hosea 1:4
Then the Lord said to him, “Call him Jezreel, for soon I will punish the house of Jehu for the bloodshed at Jezreel, and I will bring an end to the kingdom of Israel.

## Hosea 1:5
On that day I will break Israel’s bow in the Valley of Jezreel.”

## Hosea 1:6
Gomer conceived again and gave birth to a daughter. And the Lord said to him, “Name her Lo-Ruhamah, for I will no longer show love to the house of Israel, that I should forgive them.

## Hosea 1:7
But I will show love to the house of Judah and save them by the Lord their God, not by bow, sword, battle, horses, or horsemen.”

## Hosea 1:11
The people of Judah and the people of Israel will be gathered together, and they will appoint one leader and come up from the land, for great will be the day of Jezreel.
