# Hosea Chapter 7

## Hosea 7:1

> When I would heal Israel,  
> The guilt of Ephraim is uncovered,  
> And the evil deeds of Samaria,  
> For they practice deception;  
> The thief enters,  
> A band of robbers attack outside,

## Hosea 7:2

> And they do not consider in their hearts  
> That I am aware of all their wickedness.  
> Now their deeds are all around them;  
> They are before My eyes.

## Hosea 7:3

> Through their wickedness they please the king,  
> And the officials are pleased with their deceit.

## Hosea 7:4

> They are all adulterers,  
> Like an oven heated by the baker,  
> Who stops stirring the fire  
> From the kneading of the dough until it is leavened.

## Hosea 7:5

> On the day of our king, the officials became sick with the heat of wine;  
> He extended his hand to scoffers,

## Hosea 7:6

> For their hearts are like an oven  
> As they approach their plotting;  
> Their anger smoulders all night,  
> In the morning it burns like a flaming fire.

## Hosea 7:7

> All of them are inflamed like an oven,  
> And they consume their rulers;  
> All their kings have fallen.  
> None of them seeks Me.

## Hosea 7:8

> Ephraim mixes himself with the peoples;  
> Ephraim has become a flat cake not turned over.

## Hosea 7:9

> Strangers devour his strength,  
> Yet he does not know it;  
> Grey hairs also are sprinkled on him,  
> Yet he does not know it.

## Hosea 7:10

> Although Israel's pride testifies against him,  
> They have still not returned to the Lord their God,  
> Nor have they sought Him, despite everything.

## Hosea 7:11

> So Ephraim has become like a naive dove, lacking sense;  
> They call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.

## Hosea 7:12

> When they go, I will spread My net over them;  
> I will bring them down like the birds of the sky.  
> I will discipline them in accordance with the news to their assembly.

## Hosea 7:13

> Woe to them, for they have wandered from Me!  
> Destruction is theirs, for they have rebelled against Me!  
> I would redeem them, but they have spoken falsehoods against Me.

## Hosea 7:14

> And they do not cry to Me from their heart  
> When they wail on their beds;  
> For the sake of grain and new wine they gather themselves,  
> They turn away from Me.

## Hosea 7:15

> Although I trained and strengthened their arms,  
> Yet they plot evil against Me.

## Hosea 7:16

> They turn, but not upward,  
> They are like a deceitful bow;  
> Their officials will fall by the sword  
> Because of the insolence of their tongue.  
> This will be their derision in the land of Egypt.
