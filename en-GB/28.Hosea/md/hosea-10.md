# Hosea Chapter 10

## Hosea 10:1

> Israel is a luxuriant vine;  
> He produces fruit for himself.  
> The more his fruit,  
> The more altars he made;  
> The richer his land,  
> The better he made the memorial stones.

## Hosea 10:2

> Their heart is deceitful;  
> Now they must suffer for their guilt.  
> The Lord will break down their altars  
> And destroy their memorial stones.

## Hosea 10:3

> Certainly now they will say,  
> “We have no king,  
> For we do not revere the Lord.  
> As for the king, what can he do for us?”

## Hosea 10:4

> They speak mere words,  
> With worthless oaths they make covenants;  
> And judgment sprouts like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field.

## Hosea 10:5

> The inhabitants of Samaria will fear  
> For the calf of Beth-aven.  
> Indeed, its people will mourn for it,  
> And so will its idolatrous priests,  
> Who rejoiced over it and over its glory,  
> Since it has departed from it.

## Hosea 10:6

> The thing itself will be brought to Assyria  
> As a gift of tribute to King Jareb;  
> Ephraim will be seized with shame,  
> And Israel will be ashamed of its own plan.

## Hosea 10:7

> Samaria and her king will perish,  
> Like a twig on the surface of the water.

## Hosea 10:8

> Also the high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, will be destroyed;  
> Thorns and thistles will grow on their altars.  
> Then they will say to the mountains, “Cover us!”  
> And to the hills, “Fall on us!”

## Hosea 10:9

> Since the days of Gibeah you have sinned, Israel;  
> There they stand!  
> Will the battle against the sons of injustice not overtake them in Gibeah?

## Hosea 10:10

> When it is My desire, I will discipline them;  
> And peoples will be gathered against them  
> When they are bound for their double guilt.

## Hosea 10:11

> And I passed over her lovely neck;  
> I will harness Ephraim,  
> Judah will plough, Jacob will harrow for himself.

## Hosea 10:12

> Sow for yourselves in righteousness,  
> Reap in accordance with kindness;  
> Break up your uncultivated ground,  
> For it is time to seek the Lord  
> Until He comes and rains righteousness on you.

## Hosea 10:13

> You have ploughed wickedness, you have harvested injustice,  
> You have eaten the fruit of lies.  
> Because you have trusted in your way, in your many warriors,

## Hosea 10:14

> An uproar will arise among your people,  
> And all your fortresses will be destroyed,  
> As Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel on the day of battle,  
> When mothers were dashed to pieces with their children.

## Hosea 10:15

> So it will be done to you at Bethel because of your great wickedness;  
> At dawn the king of Israel will be completely destroyed.
