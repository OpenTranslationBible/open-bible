## Hosea 11:1

> When Israel was young, I cherished him,  
> And from Egypt, I summoned My son.

## Hosea 11:2

> The further they strayed from them;  
> They continued sacrificing to the Baals  
> And offering incense to idols.

## Hosea 11:3

> Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk,  
> I held them in My arms;  
> But they did not realise that I healed them.

## Hosea 11:4

> I led them with human cords,  
> With bonds of love,  
> And I was to them as one who eases the yoke from their jaws;  
> And I stooped down and fed them.

## Hosea 11:5

> They shall not return to the land of Egypt;  
> But Assyria will be their king  
> Because they refused to come back to Me.

> And the sword will whirl against their cities,  
> And will destroy their oracle priests,  
> And will consume them because of their counsels.

> So My people are resolute in turning away from Me.  
> Though they call upon the One on high,  
> None truly exalts Him.

## Hosea 11:8

> How can I give you up, Ephraim?  
> How can I surrender you, Israel?  
> How can I make you like Admah?  
> How can I treat you like Zeboiim?  
> My heart is stirred within Me,  
> All My compassions are ignited.

## Hosea 11:9

> I will not unleash My fierce anger;  
> I will not destroy Ephraim again.  
> For I am God and not a mortal,  
> The Holy One among you,  
> And I will not come in fury.

## Hosea 11:10

> They will follow the Lord,  
> He will roar like a lion;  
> Indeed He will roar,  
> And His children will come trembling from the west.

## Hosea 11:11

> They will come trembling like birds from Egypt,  
> And like doves from the land of Assyria;  
> And I will settle them in their homes, declares the Lord.

## Hosea 11:12

> Ephraim surrounds Me with falsehood,  
> And the house of Israel with deceit;  
> Judah is also defiant against God,  
> Even against the Holy One who is steadfast.
