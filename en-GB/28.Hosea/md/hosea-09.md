# Hosea Chapter 9

## Hosea 9:1

> Do not rejoice, Israel, with jubilation like the nations!  
> For you have been unfaithful to your God;  
> You have loved the earnings of a prostitute on every threshing floor.

## Hosea 9:2

> The threshing floor and wine press will not sustain them,  
> And the new wine will disappoint them.

## Hosea 9:3

> They will not dwell in the Lord’s land,  
> But Ephraim will return to Egypt,  
> And in Assyria, they will consume impure food.

## Hosea 9:4

> They will not pour out drink offerings of wine to the Lord,  
> Nor will their sacrifices please Him.  
> Their bread will be like mourners’ bread;  
> All who eat it will be defiled,  
> Because their bread will be for themselves alone;  
> It will not enter the house of the Lord.

## Hosea 9:5

> How will you fare on the day of the appointed festival  
> And on the day of the feast of the Lord?

## Hosea 9:6

> For behold, they will flee because of destruction;  
> Egypt will take them in,  
> Memphis will bury them.  
> Weeds will take possession of their treasures of silver;  
> Thorns will be in their tents.

## Hosea 9:7

> The days of punishment have come,  
> The days of retribution have come;  
> Let Israel know this!  
> The prophet is considered a fool,  
> The inspired person a maniac,  
> Because of the grossness of your wrongdoing,  
> And because your hostility is so great.

## Hosea 9:8

> Ephraim was a watchman with my God, a prophet,  
> Yet a snare of a bird catcher is in all his ways,  
> And there is only hostility in the house of his God.

## Hosea 9:9

> They have gone as far as the depths of depravity,  
> As in the days of Gibeah;  
> He will remember their guilt,  
> He will punish their sins.

## Hosea 9:10

> I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness;  
> I valued your forefathers as the earliest fruit on the fig tree in its first season.  
> But they went to Baal-peor to devot themselves to disgrace,  
> And they became as detestable to me as all they cherished there.

## Hosea 9:11

> As for Ephraim, their splendour will vanish like a bird—  
> No birth, no pregnancy, and no conception!

## Hosea 9:12

> Though they bring up their children,  
> Yet I will bereave them until not one is left.  
> Woe to them indeed when I depart from them!

## Hosea 9:13

> Ephraim, as I have seen,  
> Is planted in a pasture like Tyre;  
> But Ephraim is destined to bring out his children for destruction.

## Hosea 9:14

> Give them, Lord—what will You give?  
> Give them a miscarrying womb and dried-up breasts.

## Hosea 9:15

> All their wickedness is at Gilgal;  
> Indeed, I came to despise them there!  
> Because of the wickedness of their deeds  
> I will drive them out of My house!  
> I will no longer cherish them;  
> All their leaders are rebels.

## Hosea 9:16

> Ephraim is stricken, their root is dried up,  
> They will produce no fruit.  
> Even though they give birth,  
> I will put to death the precious ones of their wombs.

## Hosea 9:17

> My God will reject them  
> Because they have not listened to Him;  
> And they will become wanderers among the nations.
