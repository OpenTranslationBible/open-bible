# Hosea Chapter 8

## Hosea 8:1

> Put the trumpet to your lips!  
> Like an eagle the enemy comes against the house of the Lord,  
> Because they have violated My covenant  
> And rebelled against My Law.

## Hosea 8:2

> They cry out to Me,  
> “My God, we of Israel know You!”

## Hosea 8:3

> Israel has rejected the good;  
> The enemy will pursue him.

## Hosea 8:4

> They have set up kings, but not by Me;  
> They have appointed officials, but I did not know them.  
> With their silver and gold they have made idols for themselves,  
> So that they will be eliminated.

## Hosea 8:5

> He has rejected your calf, Samaria, saying,  
> “My anger burns against them!”  
> How long will they be incapable of innocence?

## Hosea 8:6

> For from Israel comes even this!  
> A craftsman made it, so it is not God;  
> Surely the calf of Samaria will be broken to pieces.

## Hosea 8:7

> For they sow the wind  
> And they harvest the whirlwind.  
> The standing grain has no kernels;  
> It yields no grain.  
> If it were to yield, strangers would swallow it.

## Hosea 8:8

> Israel has been swallowed up;  
> They are now among the nations  
> Like a vessel in which no one delights.

## Hosea 8:9

> For they have gone up to Assyria,  
> Like a wild donkey all alone;  
> Ephraim has paid fees for lovers.

## Hosea 8:10

> Even though they hire allies among the nations,  
> I will gather them now;  
> And they will begin to diminish  
> Because of the burden of the king of officials.

## Hosea 8:11

> Since Ephraim has multiplied altars for sin,  
> They have become altars of sinning for him.

## Hosea 8:12

> Though I wrote for him ten thousand precepts of My Law,  
> They are regarded as a strange thing.

## Hosea 8:13

> As for My sacrificial gifts,  
> They sacrifice the meat and eat it,  
> But the Lord does not accept them.  
> Now He will remember their guilt  
> And punish them for their sins;  
> They will return to Egypt.

## Hosea 8:14

> For Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces;  
> And Judah has multiplied fortified cities,  
> But I will send fire on its cities,  
> And it will consume its citadels.
