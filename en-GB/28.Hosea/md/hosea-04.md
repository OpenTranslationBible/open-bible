# Hosea Chapter 4

## Hosea 4:1

> Listen to the word of the Lord, you sons of Israel,  
> Because the Lord has a case against the inhabitants of the land,  
> For there is no faithfulness, nor loyalty,  
> Nor knowledge of God in the land.

## Hosea 4:2

> There is oath-taking, denial, murder, stealing, and adultery.  
> They employ violence, so that bloodshed follows bloodshed.

## Hosea 4:3

> Therefore the land mourns,  
> And everyone who lives in it languishes  
> Along with the animals of the field and the birds of the sky,  
> And even the fish of the sea disappear.

## Hosea 4:4

> Yet let no one find fault, and let no one rebuke;  
> For your people are like those who contend with the priest.

## Hosea 4:5

> So you will stumble by day,  
> And the prophet also will stumble with you by night;  
> And I will destroy your mother.

## Hosea 4:6

> My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.  
> Since you have rejected knowledge,  
> I also will reject you from being My priest.  
> Since you have forgotten the Law of your God,  
> I also will forget your children.

## Hosea 4:7

> The more they multiplied, the more they sinned against Me;  
> I will change their glory into shame.

## Hosea 4:8

> They feed on the sin of My people  
> And long for their wrongdoing.

## Hosea 4:9

> And it will be, like people, like priest;  
> So I will punish them for their ways  
> And repay them for their deeds.

## Hosea 4:10

> They will eat, but not have enough;  
> They will prostitute themselves, but not increase,  
> Because they stopped giving regard to the Lord.

## Hosea 4:11

> Infidelity, wine, and new wine take away the understanding.

## Hosea 4:12

> My people consult their wooden idol,  
> And their diviner’s wand informs them;  
> For a spirit of infidelity leads them astray,  
> And they have been unfaithful to their God.

## Hosea 4:13

> They offer sacrifices on the tops of the mountains  
> And burn incense on the hills,  
> Under oak, poplar, and terebinth,  
> Because their shade is pleasant.  
> Therefore your daughters prostitute themselves,  
> And your brides commit adultery.

## Hosea 4:14

> I will not punish your daughters when they prostitute themselves,  
> Or your brides when they commit adultery,  
> Because the men themselves slip away with prostitutes  
> And offer sacrifices with temple prostitutes;  
> So the people without understanding are ruined.

## Hosea 4:15

> Though you, Israel, play the prostitute,  
> Do not let Judah become guilty.  
> Do not go to Gilgal,  
> Or go up to Beth-aven,  
> And do not swear, “As the Lord lives!”

## Hosea 4:16

> Since Israel is stubborn  
> Like a stubborn cow,  
> Will the Lord now pasture them  
> Like a lamb in a large field?

## Hosea 4:17

> Ephraim is allied with idols;  
> Leave him alone.

## Hosea 4:18

> Their liquor is gone,  
> They prostitute themselves continually;  
> Their rulers dearly love shame.

## Hosea 4:19

> The wind wraps them in its wings,  
> And they will be put to shame because of their sacrifices.
