# Hosea Chapter 4

## Hosea 4:1
Hear the word of the Lord, O children of Israel, for the Lord has a complaint against the residents of the land: there is neither truth nor loyalty, nor knowledge of God in the land.

## Hosea 4:2
There is cursing, deceit, murder, theft, and adultery; they resort to violence, and bloodshed follows bloodshed.

## Hosea 4:3
Because of this, the land mourns, and all who dwell in it languish; the beasts of the field, the birds of the air, and even the fish of the sea are taken away.

## Hosea 4:4
But let no one accuse, let no one rebuke another, for your people are like those who contend with a priest.

## Hosea 4:5
You will stumble by day, and the prophet will also stumble with you by night; and I will destroy your mother.

## Hosea 4:6
My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. Because you have rejected knowledge, I will also reject you from being my priests; because you have forgotten the law of your God, I will also forget your children.

## Hosea 4:7
The more they increased, the more they sinned against me; I will turn their glory into shame.

## Hosea 4:8
They feed on the sin of my people and desire their iniquity.

## Hosea 4:9
And it shall be: like people, like priest. I will punish them for their ways and repay them for their deeds.

## Hosea 4:10
They shall eat, but not be satisfied; they shall engage in prostitution, but not multiply, because they have ceased devoting themselves to the Lord.

## Hosea 4:11
Infidelity, wine, and new wine take away their understanding.

## Hosea 4:12
My people consult their wooden idol, and their diviner’s rod speaks to them; a spirit of infidelity has led them astray, and they have been unfaithful to their God.

## Hosea 4:13
They sacrifice on the mountain tops and burn incense on the hills, under oak, poplar, and terebinth, because their shade is good. Therefore, your daughters turn to prostitution and your daughters-in-law to adultery.

## Hosea 4:14
I will not punish your daughters when they turn to prostitution, nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery, because the men themselves consort with harlots and sacrifice with shrine prostitutes; a people without understanding will come to ruin.

## Hosea 4:15
Though you, Israel, commit adultery, let not Judah become guilty. Do not go to Gilgal, nor go up to Beth Aven, and do not swear, ‘As surely as the Lord lives!’

## Hosea 4:16
For Israel is stubborn, like a stubborn heifer. How then can the Lord pasture them like lambs in a broad meadow?

## Hosea 4:17
Ephraim is joined to idols; leave him alone.

## Hosea 4:18
Even when their drink is gone, they continue their prostitution; their rulers love shameful ways.

## Hosea 4:19
A whirlwind will wrap them in its wings, and they will be put to shame because of their sacrifices.
