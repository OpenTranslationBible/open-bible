# Hosea Chapter 2

## Hosea 2:1

Say to your brothers, “Ammi,” and to your sisters, “Ruhamah.”

## Hosea 2:2

> Plead with your mother, plead—  
> Because she is not my wife, and I am not her husband!—  
> So that she remove her prostitution from her face  
> And her adultery from between her breasts,

## Hosea 2:3

> Or I will strip her naked  
> And expose her as on the day she was born.  
> I will also make her like a wilderness,  
> Make her like desert land,  
> And put her to death with thirst.

## Hosea 2:4

> Also, I will not take pity on her children,  
> Because they are children of prostitution.

## Hosea 2:5

> For their mother has practiced prostitution;  
> She who conceived them has acted shamefully.  
> For she said, “I will go after my lovers,  
> Who give me my bread and my water,  
> My wool and my linen, my oil and my drink.”

## Hosea 2:6

> Therefore, behold, I will obstruct her way with thorns,  
> And I will build a stone wall against her so that she cannot find her paths.

## Hosea 2:7

> And she will pursue her lovers, but she will not reach them;  
> And she will seek them, but will not find them.  
> Then she will say,  
> “I will go back to my first husband,  
> Because it was better for me then than now.”

## Hosea 2:8

> Yet she does not know that it was I who gave her the grain, the new wine, and the oil,  
> And lavished on her silver and gold,  
> Which they used for Baal.

## Hosea 2:9

> Therefore, I will take back My grain at harvest time  
> And My new wine at its season.  
> I will also take away My wool and My linen  
> That I gave her to cover her nakedness.

## Hosea 2:10

> And now I will uncover her lewdness  
> In the sight of her lovers,  
> And no one will rescue her out of My hand.

## Hosea 2:11

> I will also put an end to all her joy,  
> Her feasts, her new moons, her Sabbaths,  
> And all her appointed festivals.

## Hosea 2:12

> And I will destroy her vines and fig trees,  
> Of which she said,  
> “They are my wages  
> Which my lovers have given me.”  
> And I will turn them into a forest,  
> And the animals of the field will devour them.

## Hosea 2:13

> And I will punish her for the days of the Baals  
> When she used to offer sacrifices to them,  
> And adorn herself with her nose ring and jewelry,  
> And follow her lovers,  
> So that she forgot Me,” declares the Lord.

## Hosea 2:14

> “Therefore, behold, I am going to persuade her,  
> Bring her into the wilderness,  
> And speak kindly to her.

## Hosea 2:15

> Then I will give her her vineyards from there,  
> And the Valley of Achor as a door of hope.  
> And she will respond there as in the days of her youth,  
> As on the day when she went up from the land of Egypt.

## Hosea 2:16

> And it will come about on that day,” declares the Lord,  
> “That you will call Me ‘my Husband’  
> And no longer call Me ‘my Baal.’

## Hosea 2:17

> For I will remove the names of the Baals from her mouth,  
> So that they will no longer be mentioned by their names.

## Hosea 2:18

> On that day I will also make a covenant for them  
> With the animals of the field,  
> The birds of the sky,  
> And the crawling things of the ground.  
> And I will eliminate the bow, the sword, and war from the land,  
> And will let them lie down in safety.

## Hosea 2:19

> I will betroth you to Me forever;  
> Yes, I will betroth you to Me in righteousness and in justice,  
> In favour and in compassion,

## Hosea 2:20

> And I will betroth you to Me in faithfulness.  
> Then you will know the Lord.

## Hosea 2:21

> And it will come about on that day  
> That I will respond,” declares the Lord.  
> “I will respond to the heavens, and they will respond to the earth,

## Hosea 2:22

> And the earth will respond to the grain, to the new wine, and to the oil,  
> And they will respond to Jezreel.

## Hosea 2:23

> I will sow her for Myself in the land.  
> I will also have mercy on her who had not obtained mercy,  
> And I will say to those who were not My people, ‘You are My people!’  
> And they will say, ‘You are my God!’”
