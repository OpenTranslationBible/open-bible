# Deuteronomy Chapter 7

## Deuteronomy 7:1
When the Lord your God brings you into the land you are entering to take possession of, and drives out many nations before you—the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than you—

## Deuteronomy 7:2
and when the Lord your God delivers them over to you and you defeat them, you shall utterly destroy them. Make no covenant with them, and show them no mercy.

## Deuteronomy 7:3
Do not intermarry with them. Do not give your daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons,

## Deuteronomy 7:4
for they will turn your children away from following me to serve other gods. Then the Lord’s anger will be kindled against you, and He will quickly destroy you.

## Deuteronomy 7:5
This is what you shall do to them: Tear down their altars, smash their sacred stones, cut down their Asherah poles, and burn their carved images in the fire.

## Deuteronomy 7:6
For you are a holy people to the Lord your God. The Lord your God has chosen you to be His treasured possession out of all the peoples on the face of the earth.

## Deuteronomy 7:7
The Lord did not set His affection on you and choose you because you were more numerous than other peoples, for you were the fewest of all peoples.

## Deuteronomy 7:8
But it was because the Lord loved you and kept the oath He swore to your forefathers that He brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the house of slavery, from the power of Pharaoh, king of Egypt.

## Deuteronomy 7:9
Know therefore that the Lord your God is God; He is the faithful God, keeping His covenant of love to a thousand generations of those who love Him and keep His commandments.

## Deuteronomy 7:10
But those who hate Him He will repay to their face by destruction; He will not hesitate to repay to their face those who hate Him.

## Deuteronomy 7:11
Therefore, take care to follow the commands, decrees, and laws I give you today.

## Deuteronomy 7:12
If you pay attention to these laws and are careful to follow them, then the Lord your God will maintain His covenant of love with you, as He swore to your ancestors.

## Deuteronomy 7:13
He will love you, bless you, and increase your numbers. He will bless the fruit of your womb, the crops of your land—your grain, new wine, and olive oil—the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks in the land He swore to your forefathers to give you.

## Deuteronomy 7:14
You will be blessed above all peoples; none of your men or women will be childless, nor will any of your livestock be without young.

## Deuteronomy 7:15
The Lord will keep you free from every disease. He will not inflict on you the dreadful diseases you knew in Egypt, but He will give them to all who hate you.

## Deuteronomy 7:16
You must destroy all the peoples the Lord your God delivers to you. Do not look on them with pity and do not serve their gods, for that would be a snare to you.

## Deuteronomy 7:17
You may say in your heart, “These nations are greater than we are. How can we drive them out?”

## Deuteronomy 7:18
But do not be afraid of them; remember well what the Lord your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt.

## Deuteronomy 7:19
You saw with your own eyes the great trials, the signs and wonders, the mighty hand and outstretched arm with which the Lord your God brought you out. The Lord your God will do the same to all the peoples you now fear.

## Deuteronomy 7:20
Moreover, the Lord your God will send the hornet among them until even the survivors who hide from you have perished.

## Deuteronomy 7:21
Do not be terrified by them, for the Lord your God, who is among you, is a great and awesome God.

## Deuteronomy 7:22
The Lord your God will drive out those nations before you, little by little. You will not be able to eliminate them all at once, or the wild animals will become too numerous for you.

## Deuteronomy 7:23
But the Lord your God will deliver them over to you, throwing them into great confusion until they are destroyed.

## Deuteronomy 7:24
He will hand their kings over to you, and you will wipe out their names from under heaven. No one will be able to stand against you; you will destroy them.

## Deuteronomy 7:25
The carved images of their gods you are to burn in the fire. Do not covet the silver and gold on them, nor take it for yourselves, or you will be ensnared by it, for it is detestable to the Lord your God.

## Deuteronomy 7:26
Do not bring a detestable thing into your house or you, like it, will be set apart for destruction. Regard it as vile and utterly detest it, for it is set apart for destruction.
