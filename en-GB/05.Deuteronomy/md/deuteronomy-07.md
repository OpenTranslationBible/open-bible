# Deuteronomy Chapter 7

## Deuteronomy 7:1
When the Lord your God brings you into the land you are entering to possess, and clears away many nations before you—the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites—seven nations larger and stronger than you,

## Deuteronomy 7:2
and when the Lord your God delivers them into your hands and you defeat them, you must completely destroy them. Make no treaty with them and show them no mercy.

## Deuteronomy 7:3
Do not intermarry with them. Do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons.

## Deuteronomy 7:4
For they would turn your children away from following Me to serve other gods, and the Lord’s anger would burn against you and quickly destroy you.

## Deuteronomy 7:5
This is what you are to do to them: tear down their altars, smash their sacred stones, cut down their Asherah poles, and burn their idols in the fire.

## Deuteronomy 7:6
For you are a people holy to the Lord your God. The Lord your God has chosen you out of all the peoples on the earth to be His treasured possession.

## Deuteronomy 7:7
The Lord did not set His affection on you or choose you because you were more numerous than other peoples—for you were the fewest of all peoples—

## Deuteronomy 7:8
but because the Lord loved you and kept the oath He swore to your ancestors, He brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the land of slavery, from the power of Pharaoh king of Egypt.

## Deuteronomy 7:9
Know therefore that the Lord your God is God; He is the faithful God, keeping His covenant of love to a thousand generations of those who love Him and keep His commandments.

## Deuteronomy 7:10
But He repays those who hate Him to their face, to destroy them. He will not be slow to repay those who hate Him.

## Deuteronomy 7:11
Therefore, be careful to keep the commandments, statutes, and ordinances I am giving you today.

## Deuteronomy 7:12
If you listen to these laws and are careful to obey them, the Lord your God will keep His covenant of love with you, as He swore to your ancestors.

## Deuteronomy 7:13
He will love you and bless you and multiply you. He will bless the fruit of your womb, the crops of your land—your grain, new wine, and oil—the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks in the land He swore to your forefathers to give you.

## Deuteronomy 7:14
You will be more blessed than any other people; none among you will be childless, nor any of your livestock without offspring.

## Deuteronomy 7:15
The Lord will keep you free from every disease. He will not inflict on you the terrible diseases you knew in Egypt, but will lay them on all who hate you.

## Deuteronomy 7:16
You must destroy all the peoples the Lord your God hands over to you. Do not look on them with pity, and do not serve their gods, for that would be a trap to you.

## Deuteronomy 7:17
You may say to yourselves, ‘These nations are stronger than we are. How can we drive them out?’

## Deuteronomy 7:18
But do not be afraid of them. Remember what the Lord your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt.

## Deuteronomy 7:19
You saw with your own eyes the great trials, signs, wonders, strong hand, and outstretched arm with which the Lord your God brought you out. The Lord will do the same to all the peoples you now fear.

## Deuteronomy 7:20
The Lord your God will also send the hornet among them until those who are left and those who hide from you perish.

## Deuteronomy 7:21
Do not be terrified by them, for the Lord your God, who is among you, is great and awesome.

## Deuteronomy 7:22
The Lord your God will drive out those nations before you little by little. You will not be allowed to eliminate them all at once, or wild animals will multiply around you.

## Deuteronomy 7:23
But the Lord your God will hand them over to you. He will throw them into great confusion until they are destroyed.

## Deuteronomy 7:24
He will deliver their kings into your hand, and you will wipe out their names from under heaven. No one will be able to stand against you; you will destroy them.

## Deuteronomy 7:25
Burn the images of their gods in the fire. Do not covet the silver and gold on them, or take it for yourselves, or it will become a snare to you. It is detestable to the Lord your God.

## Deuteronomy 7:26
Do not bring any detestable thing into your house, or you will be set apart for destruction like it. Regard it as unclean and utterly abhor it, for it is set apart for destruction.
