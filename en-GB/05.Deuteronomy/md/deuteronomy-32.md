## Deuteronomy 32:50
And you shall pass away on the mountain you ascend and be gathered to your people, just as Aaron your brother passed away on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people,

## Deuteronomy 32:51
because you broke faith with me in the midst of the people of Israel at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin, because you did not uphold me as holy in the midst of the people of Israel.

## Deuteronomy 32:52
For you shall see the land before you, but you shall not enter there, into the land that I am giving to the people of Israel.”
