## Deuteronomy 32:50

And die on the mountain which you ascend, and be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people,

## Deuteronomy 32:51

because you broke faith with Me in the midst of the people of Israel at the waters of Meribah-kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin, and because you did not treat Me as holy in the midst of the people of Israel.

## Deuteronomy 32:52

For you shall see the land before you, but you shall not go there, into the land that I am giving to the people of Israel.
