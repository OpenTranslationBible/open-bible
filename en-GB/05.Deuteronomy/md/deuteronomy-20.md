# Deuteronomy Chapter 20

## Deuteronomy 20:1
When you go out to battle against your enemies and see horses, chariots, and a people more numerous than yourselves, do not be afraid of them; for the Lord your God, who brought you up out of Egypt, is with you.

## Deuteronomy 20:2
As you are about to engage in battle, the priest shall come forward and speak to the people.

## Deuteronomy 20:3
He shall say: “Listen, Israel, today you are going into battle against your enemies. Do not be fainthearted or afraid; do not panic or be terrified of them.

## Deuteronomy 20:4
For the Lord your God is the one who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies, to give you victory.”

## Deuteronomy 20:5
The officers shall then speak to the people, saying, “Has anyone built a new house and not yet dedicated it? Let him go back to his house, lest he die in battle and another man dedicate it.

## Deuteronomy 20:6
Has anyone planted a vineyard and not yet enjoyed its fruit? Let him return to his house, lest he die in battle and another man enjoy its fruit.

## Deuteronomy 20:7
Has anyone become betrothed to a woman and not yet married her? Let him return to his house, lest he die in battle and another man marry her.”

## Deuteronomy 20:8
The officers shall also say, “Is anyone afraid or fainthearted? Let him return to his house, so that the hearts of his fellow soldiers will not melt like his own.”

## Deuteronomy 20:9
When the officers have finished addressing the people, they shall appoint commanders over the army.

## Deuteronomy 20:10
When you approach a city to wage war against it, you shall offer it terms of peace.

## Deuteronomy 20:11
If it agrees to make peace with you and opens its gates, all the people found in it shall become your forced labour and serve you.

## Deuteronomy 20:12
But if it refuses to make peace and engages you in battle, you shall besiege it.

## Deuteronomy 20:13
When the Lord your God delivers it into your hands, you shall strike down all the men in it with the sword.

## Deuteronomy 20:14
However, the women, children, livestock, and everything else in the city, all its spoils, you may take as plunder for yourselves; and you shall use the plunder the Lord your God has given you from your enemies.

## Deuteronomy 20:15
This is how you are to treat all the cities that are at a distance from you and do not belong to the nations nearby.

## Deuteronomy 20:16
But in the cities of the nations that the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance, you shall not leave anything that breathes alive.

## Deuteronomy 20:17
You shall completely destroy them—the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites—as the Lord your God has commanded you.

## Deuteronomy 20:18
Otherwise, they will teach you to follow all the detestable practices they perform for their gods, and you will sin against the Lord your God.

## Deuteronomy 20:19
When you lay siege to a city for a long time, fighting against it to capture it, do not destroy its trees by putting an axe to them, because you can eat their fruit. Do not cut them down. Are trees of the field human, that you should besiege them?

## Deuteronomy 20:20
However, you may cut down trees that you know are not fruit trees and use them to build siege works against the city that is at war with you, until it falls.
