# Deuteronomy Chapter 14

## Deuteronomy 14:1
You are children of the Lord your God. Do not cut yourselves or shave the front of your heads for the dead,

## Deuteronomy 14:2
for you are a holy people to the Lord your God. Out of all the peoples on the face of the earth, the Lord has chosen you to be His treasured possession.

## Deuteronomy 14:3
Do not eat anything that is detestable.

## Deuteronomy 14:4
These are the animals you may eat: the ox, sheep, goat,

## Deuteronomy 14:5
deer, gazelle, roe deer, wild goat, ibex, antelope, and mountain sheep.

## Deuteronomy 14:6
You may eat any animal that has a divided hoof and that chews the cud.

## Deuteronomy 14:7
However, of those that chew the cud or have divided hooves, you may not eat the camel, rabbit, or hyrax. Though they chew the cud, they do not have divided hooves—they are unclean for you.

## Deuteronomy 14:8
The pig is also unclean because it has a split hoof but does not chew the cud. Do not eat their meat or touch their carcasses.

## Deuteronomy 14:9
Of all the creatures that live in water, you may eat any that have fins and scales.

## Deuteronomy 14:10
But anything that does not have fins and scales you must not eat; it is unclean for you.

## Deuteronomy 14:11
You may eat any clean bird.

## Deuteronomy 14:12
But you must not eat the eagle, vulture, black vulture,

## Deuteronomy 14:13
red kite, black kite, and other birds of prey,

## Deuteronomy 14:14
all ravens,

## Deuteronomy 14:15
the ostrich, nighthawk, seagull, and hawks of all kinds,

## Deuteronomy 14:16
the little owl, great owl, white owl,

## Deuteronomy 14:17
desert owl, osprey, cormorant,

## Deuteronomy 14:18
stork, herons of all kinds, hoopoe, and bat.

## Deuteronomy 14:19
All winged insects that swarm are unclean to you; do not eat them.

## Deuteronomy 14:20
But any clean winged creature you may eat.

## Deuteronomy 14:21
Do not eat anything you find dead. You may give it to the foreigner residing in your towns, or sell it to a foreigner, but you are a people holy to the Lord your God. Do not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk.

## Deuteronomy 14:22
Be sure to set aside a tenth of all that your fields produce each year.

## Deuteronomy 14:23
Eat the tithe of your grain, new wine, and oil, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks in the presence of the Lord your God at the place He will choose as a dwelling for His name, so that you may learn to revere the Lord your God always.

## Deuteronomy 14:24
But if the distance is too great and you cannot carry your tithe, because the place is too far away and the Lord your God has blessed you,

## Deuteronomy 14:25
then exchange it for silver. Take the silver with you and go to the place the Lord your God will choose.

## Deuteronomy 14:26
Use the silver to buy whatever you like—cattle, sheep, wine, strong drink, or anything you desire. Then eat there in the presence of the Lord your God and rejoice—you and your household.

## Deuteronomy 14:27
And do not neglect the Levites living in your towns, for they have no inheritance of their own.

## Deuteronomy 14:28
At the end of every three years, bring a tenth of all your produce for that year and store it in your towns.

## Deuteronomy 14:29
Then the Levites (because they have no inheritance), and the foreigners, the fatherless, and the widows in your towns, may come and eat and be satisfied, so that the Lord your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.
