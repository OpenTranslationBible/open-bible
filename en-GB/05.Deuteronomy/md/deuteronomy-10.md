# Deuteronomy Chapter 10

## Deuteronomy 10:1
At that time the Lord said to me, ‘Carve out two stone tablets like the first ones, and come up to Me on the mountain. Also make a wooden ark.

## Deuteronomy 10:2
I will write on the tablets the same words that were on the first tablets, which you broke. Then you shall place them in the ark.’

## Deuteronomy 10:3
So I made an ark of acacia wood and cut two stone tablets like the first ones. I went up the mountain with the two tablets in my hands.

## Deuteronomy 10:4
The Lord wrote on the tablets what He had written before—the Ten Commandments that He had spoken to you on the mountain from the fire on the day of the assembly. Then He gave them to me.

## Deuteronomy 10:5
I turned and went down the mountain and placed the tablets in the ark I had made. There they are, just as the Lord commanded me.

## Deuteronomy 10:6
The Israelites traveled from the wells of Bene Jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died and was buried, and his son Eleazar became priest in his place.

## Deuteronomy 10:7
From there they went to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land with flowing streams.

## Deuteronomy 10:8
At that time, the Lord set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the Lord, to stand before the Lord to minister to Him, and to bless in His name, as they still do today.

## Deuteronomy 10:9
That is why the Levites have no share or inheritance among their fellow Israelites; the Lord is their inheritance, as the Lord your God promised them.

## Deuteronomy 10:10
I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights, as I did the first time, and the Lord listened to me again. He was not willing to destroy you.

## Deuteronomy 10:11
The Lord said to me, ‘Go and lead the people on their way, so that they may enter and possess the land I swore to give to their ancestors.’

## Deuteronomy 10:12
And now, Israel, what does the Lord your God require of you but to fear the Lord your God, to walk in all His ways, to love Him, to serve the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul,

## Deuteronomy 10:13
and to keep the commandments and statutes of the Lord, which I am commanding you today for your own good?

## Deuteronomy 10:14
To the Lord your God belong the heavens—even the highest heavens—the earth and everything in it.

## Deuteronomy 10:15
Yet the Lord set His affection on your ancestors and chose their descendants after them—you—above all the nations, as it is today.

## Deuteronomy 10:16
Therefore, circumcise your hearts and do not be stiff-necked any longer.

## Deuteronomy 10:17
For the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, mighty, and awesome God, who shows no partiality and takes no bribe.

## Deuteronomy 10:18
He upholds the cause of the fatherless and the widow and loves the foreigner residing among you, giving them food and clothing.

## Deuteronomy 10:19
So you must love the foreigner, for you yourselves were foreigners in Egypt.

## Deuteronomy 10:20
Fear the Lord your God and serve Him. Hold fast to Him and swear by His name.

## Deuteronomy 10:21
He is your praise, and He is your God, who has done for you those great and awesome things your eyes have seen.

## Deuteronomy 10:22
Your ancestors went down to Egypt seventy in number, but now the Lord your God has made you as numerous as the stars in the sky.
