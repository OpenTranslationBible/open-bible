# Deuteronomy Chapter 5

## Deuteronomy 5:1
Moses called together all Israel and said to them: “Hear, O Israel, the statutes and decrees I am proclaiming in your hearing today. Learn them well and be diligent to observe them.

## Deuteronomy 5:2
The Lord our God made a covenant with us at Horeb.

## Deuteronomy 5:3
It was not with our forefathers that the Lord made this covenant, but with us, all of us who are alive here today.

## Deuteronomy 5:4
The Lord communicated with you directly at the mountain from the midst of the fire,

## Deuteronomy 5:5
while I stood between the Lord and you at that time, to declare to you the word of the Lord; for you were afraid of the fire and did not go up the mountain. And He said:

## Deuteronomy 5:6
‘I am the Lord your God, who delivered you from Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

## Deuteronomy 5:7
‘You shall have no other gods before Me.

## Deuteronomy 5:8
‘You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.

## Deuteronomy 5:9
You shall not bow down to them or serve them; for I, the Lord your God, am a zealous God, bringing the consequences of the fathers' sins upon the children to the third and fourth generation of those who reject Me,

## Deuteronomy 5:10
but showing love to thousands of generations of those who love Me and keep My commandments.

## Deuteronomy 5:11
‘You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God, for the Lord will not consider anyone guiltless who misuses His name.

## Deuteronomy 5:12
‘Keep the Sabbath day holy, as the Lord your God has instructed you.

## Deuteronomy 5:13
For six days you shall work and complete all your tasks,

## Deuteronomy 5:14
but the seventh day is a day of rest dedicated to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your male or female servant, nor your ox, your donkey or any of your animals, nor any foreigner residing in your towns, so that your male and female servants may rest, as you do.

## Deuteronomy 5:15
Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the Lord your God brought you out of there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. Therefore the Lord your God has instructed you to keep the Sabbath day.

## Deuteronomy 5:16
‘Respect your father and your mother, as the Lord your God has instructed you, so that you may live long and that it may go well with you in the land the Lord your God is giving you.

## Deuteronomy 5:17
‘You shall not murder.

## Deuteronomy 5:18
‘You shall not commit adultery.

## Deuteronomy 5:19
‘You shall not steal.

## Deuteronomy 5:20
‘You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.

## Deuteronomy 5:21
‘You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife. You shall not desire your neighbor’s house, his field, his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.’

## Deuteronomy 5:22
These are the commandments the Lord proclaimed in a loud voice to your whole assembly on the mountain from out of the fire, the cloud, and the deep darkness; and He added nothing more. Then He wrote them on two stone tablets and gave them to me.

## Deuteronomy 5:23
When you heard the voice from the midst of the darkness, while the mountain was ablaze with fire, all the leaders of your tribes and your elders approached me.

## Deuteronomy 5:24
And you said, ‘The Lord our God has shown us His glory and His majesty, and we have heard His voice from the fire. Today we have seen that God can speak with man, and yet he lives.

## Deuteronomy 5:25
But now, why should we die? This great fire will consume us, and we will die if we hear the voice of the Lord our God any longer.

## Deuteronomy 5:26
For who among all humanity has heard the voice of the living God speaking from the midst of the fire, as we have, and survived?

## Deuteronomy 5:27
Approach and listen to all that the Lord our God says. Then tell us whatever the Lord our God tells you. We will listen and obey.’

## Deuteronomy 5:28
The Lord heard you when you spoke to me, and the Lord said to me, ‘I have heard what this people said to you. They have done well in all that they have spoken.

## Deuteronomy 5:29
Oh, that their hearts would be inclined to revere Me and keep all My commands always, so that it might go well with them and their children forever!

## Deuteronomy 5:30
‘Go, instruct them to return to their tents.

## Deuteronomy 5:31
But you remain here with Me so that I may give you all the commands, decrees, and laws you are to teach them to follow in the land I am giving them to possess.’

## Deuteronomy 5:32
So be careful to do just as the Lord your God has commanded you; do not turn aside to the right or to the left.

## Deuteronomy 5:33
Follow all that the Lord your God has commanded you, so that you may live and prosper and prolong your days in the land that you will possess.
