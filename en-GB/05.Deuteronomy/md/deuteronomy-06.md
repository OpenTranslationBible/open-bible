When the Lord your God brings you into the land He swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give you—great and splendid cities which you did not build,

houses filled with all sorts of good things you did not provide, wells you did not dig, and vineyards and olive groves you did not plant—then when you eat and are satisfied,

be careful not to forget the Lord, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.

Worship the Lord your God, and serve Him only, and make your oaths in His name.

## Deuteronomy 6:14

Do not follow other gods, any of the gods of the peoples around you;

for the Lord your God, who is among you, is a jealous God; otherwise, the anger of the Lord your God will be kindled against you, and He will wipe you off the face of the earth.

## Deuteronomy 6:16

Do not test the Lord your God, like you did at Massah.

Do what is right and good in the sight of the Lord, so that it may go well with you and that you may go in and take possession of the good land the Lord promised on oath to your ancestors,

## Deuteronomy 6:19

by removing all your enemies from before you, as the Lord has spoken.

In the future, when your son asks you, “What is the meaning of the statutes, decrees, and laws which the Lord our God has commanded you?”

tell him: “We were servants of Pharaoh in Egypt, but the Lord delivered us from Egypt with a mighty hand.

## Deuteronomy 6:22

Before our eyes, the Lord performed great and terrible signs and wonders against Egypt, Pharaoh, and all his household.

## Deuteronomy 6:23

Yet He brought us out from there to bring us in and give us the land He promised on oath to our ancestors.

## Deuteronomy 6:24

The Lord commanded us to follow all these statutes and to fear the Lord our God, for our good always and for our survival, as it is today.

## Deuteronomy 6:25

And it will be our righteousness if we are careful to obey all this commandment before the Lord our God, just as He commanded us.
