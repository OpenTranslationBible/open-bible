## Deuteronomy 6:11
houses filled with good things you did not provide, wells you did not dig, and vineyards and olive groves you did not plant—then when you eat and are satisfied,

Do not test the Lord your God as you did at Massah.

Do what is right and good in the Lord’s sight, so that it may go well with you and you may enter and possess the good land the Lord promised on oath to your ancestors,

## Deuteronomy 6:19
thrusting out all your enemies before you, as the Lord said.

## Deuteronomy 6:20
In the future, when your children ask you, ‘What is the meaning of the statutes and laws that the Lord our God has commanded you?’

Before our eyes, the Lord did signs and wonders—great and terrible—against Egypt, Pharaoh, and his whole household.

But He brought us out from there to lead us in and give us the land He had promised on oath to our ancestors.

The Lord commanded us to obey all these statutes and to fear Him, so that we might always prosper and be kept alive, as is the case today.

## Deuteronomy 6:25
And if we are careful to obey all this law before the Lord our God, as He has commanded us, that will be our righteousness.
