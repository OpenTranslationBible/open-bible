# Deuteronomy Chapter 8

## Deuteronomy 8:1
Be diligent to observe all the commandments I am giving you today, so that you may live and multiply, and may enter and take possession of the land the Lord swore to your ancestors.

## Deuteronomy 8:2
And remember the entire journey the Lord your God has led you through in the wilderness these forty years, to humble you and to test you, to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep His commandments or not.

## Deuteronomy 8:3
He humbled you by letting you hunger, and then fed you with manna, which you nor your fathers had known, to make you understand that man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of the Lord.

## Deuteronomy 8:4
Your clothing did not wear out, nor did your feet swell during these forty years.

## Deuteronomy 8:5
Understand then in your heart that the Lord your God disciplines you just as a man disciplines his son.

## Deuteronomy 8:6
Therefore, keep the commandments of the Lord your God, to walk in His ways and to revere Him.

## Deuteronomy 8:7
For the Lord your God is bringing you into a good land, a land with streams, fountains, and springs, flowing out in valleys and hills;

## Deuteronomy 8:8
a land of wheat and barley, of vines, fig trees, and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey;

## Deuteronomy 8:9
a land where you will eat without scarcity, where you will lack nothing; a land whose stones are iron, and from whose hills you can extract copper.

## Deuteronomy 8:10
When you have eaten and are satisfied, you shall bless the Lord your God for the good land He has given you.

## Deuteronomy 8:11
Be careful not to forget the Lord your God by failing to keep His commandments, His laws, and His decrees which I am giving you today;

## Deuteronomy 8:12
otherwise, when you eat and are satisfied, and you build fine houses and live in them,

## Deuteronomy 8:13
and when your herds and flocks grow large, and your silver and gold increase, and all you have is multiplied,

## Deuteronomy 8:14
then your heart will become proud and you will forget the Lord your God who brought you out of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.

## Deuteronomy 8:15
He led you through the vast and terrible wilderness, with its fiery serpents and scorpions, and its thirsty ground where there was no water; He brought water for you out of the rock of flint.

## Deuteronomy 8:16
He fed you with manna in the wilderness, which your fathers had not known, to humble you and test you, to do you good in the end.

## Deuteronomy 8:17
You may say in your heart, ‘My power and the strength of my hands have produced this wealth for me.’

## Deuteronomy 8:18
But remember the Lord your God, for it is He who gives you the ability to produce wealth, in order to confirm His covenant which He swore to your ancestors, as it is today.

## Deuteronomy 8:19
If you ever forget the Lord your God and follow other gods, serving and worshipping them, I testify against you today that you will surely perish.

## Deuteronomy 8:20
As with the nations the Lord destroyed before you, so you will perish, for not obeying the voice of the Lord your God.
