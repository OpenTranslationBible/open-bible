# Deuteronomy Chapter 21

## Deuteronomy 21:1
If a slain person is found lying in the open country in the land that the Lord your God is giving you to possess, and it is not known who the killer is,

## Deuteronomy 21:2
then your elders and judges shall go out and measure the distance to the towns that are around the slain person.

## Deuteronomy 21:3
The elders of the town nearest to the body shall take a heifer that has not been worked and has not worn a yoke,

## Deuteronomy 21:4
and they shall bring it down to a valley with a flowing stream, a place that has not been ploughed or sown, and there they shall break the heifer’s neck.

## Deuteronomy 21:5
Then the Levitical priests shall step forward, for the Lord your God has chosen them to serve Him and to bless in the name of the Lord, and to settle all disputes and cases of assault.

## Deuteronomy 21:6
All the elders of the town nearest to the body shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley,

## Deuteronomy 21:7
and they shall declare: “Our hands did not shed this blood, nor did our eyes see it done.

## Deuteronomy 21:8
Forgive, Lord, Your people Israel whom You have redeemed, and do not hold the guilt of innocent blood against Your people Israel.” Thus the guilt of bloodshed shall be forgiven them.

## Deuteronomy 21:9
So you shall remove the guilt of innocent blood from among you, since you have done what is right in the eyes of the Lord.

## Deuteronomy 21:10
When you go to war against your enemies and the Lord your God delivers them into your hands and you take captives,

## Deuteronomy 21:11
if you see among the captives a beautiful woman and are attracted to her, you may take her as your wife.

## Deuteronomy 21:12
Bring her into your home, and she shall shave her head and trim her nails.

## Deuteronomy 21:13
She shall also put aside the clothes she was wearing when captured and remain in your house, mourning her father and mother for a full month. After that, you may go to her and be her husband, and she shall be your wife.

## Deuteronomy 21:14
If you are not pleased with her, you must let her go wherever she wishes. You must not sell her or treat her as a slave, since you have humiliated her.

## Deuteronomy 21:15
If a man has two wives, one loved and the other unloved, and both bear him sons, but the firstborn is the son of the unloved wife,

## Deuteronomy 21:16
when he wills his property to his sons, he must not give the rights of the firstborn to the son of the loved wife in preference to his actual firstborn, the son of the unloved wife.

## Deuteronomy 21:17
He must acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the unloved wife, by giving him a double portion of all he has, for he is the first sign of his father’s strength. The right of the firstborn belongs to him.

## Deuteronomy 21:18
If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not obey his father and mother and will not listen to them when they discipline him,

## Deuteronomy 21:19
his father and mother shall take hold of him and bring him to the elders at the gate of his town.

## Deuteronomy 21:20
They shall say to the elders, “This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey us. He is a glutton and a drunkard.”

## Deuteronomy 21:21
Then all the men of his town shall stone him to death. You must purge the evil from among you. All Israel will hear of it and be afraid.

## Deuteronomy 21:22
If a man is guilty of a capital offence and is put to death, and you hang his body on a tree,

## Deuteronomy 21:23
his body must not remain on the tree overnight. Be sure to bury it that same day, for anyone who is hanged is under God’s curse. You must not defile the land the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance.
