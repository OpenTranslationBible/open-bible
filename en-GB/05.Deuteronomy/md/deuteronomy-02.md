# Deuteronomy Chapter 2

## Deuteronomy 2:1
Then we turned back and journeyed into the wilderness toward the Red Sea, as the Lord had directed me, and we wandered around the region of Mount Seir for a long time.

## Deuteronomy 2:2
Then the Lord said to me,

## Deuteronomy 2:3
‘You have circled this mountain long enough. Turn northward.

## Deuteronomy 2:4
Give the people this instruction: You are about to pass through the territory of your relatives, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. They will be afraid of you, but be very careful.

## Deuteronomy 2:5
Do not provoke them to war, for I will not give you any of their land—not even a footstep—because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as a possession.

## Deuteronomy 2:6
You are to pay them in silver for the food you eat and the water you drink.

## Deuteronomy 2:7
Indeed, the Lord your God has blessed you in all that you have done. He has watched over your journey through this vast wilderness. These forty years, the Lord your God has been with you, and you have lacked nothing.

## Deuteronomy 2:8
So we passed by our relatives, the descendants of Esau living in Seir. We avoided the road through the Arabah and Elath and Ezion Geber and turned toward the wilderness of Moab.

## Deuteronomy 2:9
Then the Lord said to me, ‘Do not harass the Moabites or provoke them to war, for I will not give you any part of their land. I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot as their possession.’

## Deuteronomy 2:10
The Emites had once lived there—a great and numerous people, as tall as the Anakim.

## Deuteronomy 2:11
Like the Anakim, they also were considered Rephaim, though the Moabites called them Emites.

## Deuteronomy 2:12
The Horites had previously lived in Seir, but the descendants of Esau drove them out, destroying them and settling in their place—just as Israel did with the land the Lord gave them.

## Deuteronomy 2:13
Now get up and cross the Zered Valley.” So we crossed the Zered.

## Deuteronomy 2:14
The time from when we left Kadesh Barnea until we crossed the Zered Valley was thirty-eight years—until the entire generation of warriors had perished from the camp, as the Lord had sworn to them.

## Deuteronomy 2:15
The Lord’s hand was against them, to eliminate them from the camp, until all were gone.

## Deuteronomy 2:16
When all the men of war had perished,

## Deuteronomy 2:17
the Lord said to me:

## Deuteronomy 2:18
‘Today you are to pass through the territory of Moab at Ar.

## Deuteronomy 2:19
When you come near the Ammonites, do not harass or provoke them, for I will not give you any of the land of the Ammonites. I have given it to the descendants of Lot as their possession.’

## Deuteronomy 2:20
(That land also was considered the land of the Rephaim, who had formerly lived there. The Ammonites called them Zamzummim—

## Deuteronomy 2:21
a great and numerous people, as tall as the Anakim—but the Lord destroyed them before the Ammonites, who drove them out and settled in their place.

## Deuteronomy 2:22
Just as He had done for the descendants of Esau, who lived in Seir—He destroyed the Horites before them, and they settled in their place to this day.

## Deuteronomy 2:23
The Avvites lived in villages as far as Gaza, but the Caphtorites, coming from Crete, destroyed them and settled in their place.)

## Deuteronomy 2:24
‘Get up! Set out and cross the Arnon Valley. See, I have handed over to you Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land. Begin to possess it; engage him in battle.

## Deuteronomy 2:25
This day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the nations under heaven. When they hear reports of you, they will tremble and be in anguish because of you.’

## Deuteronomy 2:26
Then I sent messengers from the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying:

## Deuteronomy 2:27
‘Let us pass through your land. We will stay on the main road and not turn aside to the right or the left.

## Deuteronomy 2:28
We will buy food and water from you with silver. Only let us pass through on foot,

## Deuteronomy 2:29
as the descendants of Esau in Seir and the Moabites in Ar allowed us to do—until we cross the Jordan into the land the Lord our God is giving us.’

## Deuteronomy 2:30
But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass through, for the Lord your God had hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate in order to hand him over to you.

## Deuteronomy 2:31
The Lord said to me, ‘See, I have begun to give Sihon and his land over to you. Begin to possess it.’

## Deuteronomy 2:32
Then Sihon came out with all his men to confront us at Jahaz.

## Deuteronomy 2:33
The Lord our God handed him over to us, and we struck him down, along with his sons and his entire army.

## Deuteronomy 2:34
At that time we captured all his cities and put every man, woman, and child under the ban—we left no survivors.

## Deuteronomy 2:35
We took the livestock and plunder from the cities as our spoil.

## Deuteronomy 2:36
From Aroer on the edge of the Arnon Valley and from the city in the gorge, even as far as Gilead, not one city was too strong for us. The Lord our God gave all of them into our hands.

## Deuteronomy 2:37
But you did not go near the land of the Ammonites, or anywhere along the Jabbok River, or the towns in the hill country, or any territory the Lord had forbidden us.
