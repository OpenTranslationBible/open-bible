# Deuteronomy Chapter 2

## Deuteronomy 2:1

Then we turned and set out towards the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea, as the Lord had instructed me, and we made our way around Mount Seir for many days.

## Deuteronomy 2:2

Then the Lord spoke to me and said,

## Deuteronomy 2:3

“You have circled this hill country long enough; now turn north.

## Deuteronomy 2:4

Command the people, saying, ‘You are about to pass through the territory of your brothers, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. They will be afraid of you, so be very careful.

## Deuteronomy 2:5

Do not provoke them to war, for I will not give you any of their land, not even as much as a footprint, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as his possession.

## Deuteronomy 2:6

You are to buy food from them with money so that you may eat, and also purchase water from them with money so that you may drink.’”

## Deuteronomy 2:7

For the Lord your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. He has watched over your journey through this vast wilderness. These forty years the Lord your God has been with you; you have not lacked anything.

## Deuteronomy 2:8

So we passed by our brothers, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir, away from the Arabah road, away from Elath and Ezion-geber, and we turned and travelled along the desert road of Moab.

## Deuteronomy 2:9

Then the Lord instructed me, “Do not harass Moab or provoke them to war, for I will not give you any part of their land as a possession, because I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot as a possession.”

## Deuteronomy 2:10

(The Emites used to live there—a people as great, numerous, and tall as the Anakites.

## Deuteronomy 2:11

Like the Anakites, they too were regarded as Rephaim, but the Moabites called them Emites.

## Deuteronomy 2:12

The Horites previously lived in Seir, but the descendants of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them from before them, and settled in their place, just as Israel did in the land of their possession which the Lord gave them.)

## Deuteronomy 2:13

And the Lord said, “Now arise and cross over the Zered Valley.” So we crossed the valley.

## Deuteronomy 2:14

The time it took for us to come from Kadesh Barnea until we crossed over the Zered Valley was thirty-eight years, until that entire generation of fighting men had perished from the camp, as the Lord had sworn to them.

## Deuteronomy 2:15

Certainly, the Lord's power was against them, leading to their destruction within the camp until they all perished.

## Deuteronomy 2:16

When the last of these fighting men among the people had passed away,

## Deuteronomy 2:17

the Lord communicated to me,

## Deuteronomy 2:18

“On this day, you are to pass by the region of Moab at Ar.

## Deuteronomy 2:19

When you come opposite the Ammonites, do not harass them or provoke them to war, for I will not give you possession of any land belonging to the Ammonites. I have given it as a possession to the descendants of Lot.”

## Deuteronomy 2:20

(That too was considered a land of the Rephaim, who used to live there; but the Ammonites call them Zamzummites,

## Deuteronomy 2:21

a people as great, numerous, and tall as the Anakites. The Lord destroyed them from before the Ammonites, who drove them out and settled in their place.

## Deuteronomy 2:22

The Lord had done the same for the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir, when He destroyed the Horites from before them. They dispossessed them and settled in their place, where they remain even to this day.

## Deuteronomy 2:23

Regarding the Avvites who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorites coming out from Caphtor overcame them and settled in their place.

## Deuteronomy 2:24

“Set out now and cross the Valley of Arnon. See, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his country. Begin to take possession of it and engage him in battle.

## Deuteronomy 2:25

This very day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the faces of all the nations under heaven. They will hear reports of you and will tremble and be in anguish because of you.”

## Deuteronomy 2:26

From the wilderness of Kedemoth I sent messengers to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,

## Deuteronomy 2:27

“We request to pass through your country. We will stay on the main road; we will not turn aside to the right or to the left.

## Deuteronomy 2:28

You will sell us food for money so that we may eat, and give us water for money so that we may drink. Only let us pass through on foot—

## Deuteronomy 2:29

just as the descendants of Esau in Seir and the Moabites in Ar allowed us—until we cross the Jordan into the land the Lord our God is giving us.”

## Deuteronomy 2:30

But Sihon king of Heshbon was not willing for us to pass through his land; for the Lord your God had hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate, in order to hand him over to you, as he is today.

## Deuteronomy 2:31

And the Lord said to me, “See, I have begun to deliver Sihon and his country over to you. Now begin to conquer and possess his land.”

## Deuteronomy 2:32

Sihon then came out with all his people to meet us in battle at Jahaz.

## Deuteronomy 2:33

And the Lord our God delivered him over to us, and we defeated him with his sons and all his people.

## Deuteronomy 2:34

At that time we captured all his towns and utterly destroyed the men, women, and children of every city. We left no survivors.

## Deuteronomy 2:35

We took only the livestock and the plunder from the towns we had captured.

## Deuteronomy 2:36

From Aroer on the edge of the Valley of Arnon, and from the town in the valley, even as far as Gilead, there was no town too strong for us. The Lord our God gave us all of them.

## Deuteronomy 2:37

In obedience to the command of the Lord our God, you did not encroach on any of the land of the Ammonites, neither the land along the course of the Jabbok nor that around the towns in the hills.
