# Deuteronomy Chapter 13

## Deuteronomy 13:1
If a prophet or a dreamer of dreams arises among you and presents a sign or wonder,

## Deuteronomy 13:2
and the sign or wonder comes to pass, and he says, ‘Let us follow other gods’ (gods you have not known) ‘and let us serve them,’

## Deuteronomy 13:3
you must not heed the words of that prophet or dreamer. The Lord your God is testing you to see if you truly love Him with all your heart and soul.

## Deuteronomy 13:4
You must follow the Lord your God and fear Him. Keep His commandments, listen to His voice, serve Him, and hold fast to Him.

## Deuteronomy 13:5
That prophet or dreamer must be put to death, for he has spoken against the Lord your God who brought you out of Egypt and redeemed you from the house of slavery, seeking to lead you astray from the path the Lord your God commanded you to follow. Thus, you must eliminate the evil from among you.

## Deuteronomy 13:6
If your own brother, your son or daughter, the wife you love, or your closest friend secretly entices you, saying, ‘Let us go and serve other gods’ (gods neither you nor your ancestors have known,

## Deuteronomy 13:7
gods of the peoples around you, whether near or far, from one end of the earth to the other),

## Deuteronomy 13:8
do not yield to or listen to them. Show no pity. Do not spare or conceal them.

## Deuteronomy 13:9
You must certainly put them to death. Your hand must be the first against them to put them to death, and then the hands of all the people.

## Deuteronomy 13:10
Stone them to death, because they sought to lead you away from the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.

## Deuteronomy 13:11
Then all Israel will hear and be afraid, and no one will do such a wicked thing among you again.

## Deuteronomy 13:12
If you hear it said in one of the towns the Lord your God is giving you to live in

## Deuteronomy 13:13
that some worthless men have arisen among you and have led the people of their town astray, saying, ‘Let us go and serve other gods’ (gods you have not known),

## Deuteronomy 13:14
then you must investigate, search out, and inquire thoroughly. If it is true and it has been proven that this detestable thing has been done among you,

## Deuteronomy 13:15
you must certainly put to the sword all who live in that town. Destroy it utterly, both its people and its livestock.

## Deuteronomy 13:16
Gather all the plunder of the town into the middle of the public square and burn the town and all its plunder as a whole burnt offering to the Lord your God. It shall remain a ruin forever, never to be rebuilt.

## Deuteronomy 13:17
Nothing that is designated for destruction should remain in your hands, so that the Lord may turn from His fierce anger and show you mercy, and have compassion on you and increase your numbers, as He promised on oath to your ancestors—

## Deuteronomy 13:18
if you obey the Lord your God by keeping all His commandments that I am giving you today and doing what is right in the sight of the Lord your God.
