Sacrifice as the Passover to the Lord your God an animal from your flock or herd, in the place where the Lord chooses to establish His name.

For seven days celebrate the festival to the Lord your God at the place He will choose. The Lord will bless you in all your harvest and in all the work of your hands, and your joy will be complete.

## Deuteronomy 16:16
Three times a year all your men must appear before the Lord your God at the place He will choose: at the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Festival of Weeks, and the Festival of Tabernacles. No one shall appear before the Lord empty-handed.

Appoint judges and officials for each of your tribes in every town the Lord your God is giving you, and they shall judge the people fairly.

Pursue justice and only justice, so that you may live and possess the land the Lord your God is giving you.

## Deuteronomy 16:21
Do not set up any wooden Asherah pole beside the altar you build for the Lord your God,

## Deuteronomy 16:22
and do not erect a sacred stone, for these things the Lord your God hates.
