# Deuteronomy Chapter 19

## Deuteronomy 19:1
When the Lord your God has cut off the nations whose land He is giving you, and you have dispossessed them and settled in their cities and houses,

## Deuteronomy 19:2
you shall designate three cities for yourself in the midst of the land that the Lord your God is giving you to possess.

## Deuteronomy 19:3
Prepare the roads and divide the territory of your land into three parts, which the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance, so that anyone who kills a person unintentionally may flee there.

## Deuteronomy 19:4
This is the case concerning the one who kills another unintentionally, without prior malice: when he kills his neighbour without intent.

## Deuteronomy 19:5
For example, if a man goes with his neighbour into the forest to cut wood, and as he swings his axe to fell a tree, the iron head slips from the handle and strikes his neighbour, causing death, he may flee to one of these cities and live.

## Deuteronomy 19:6
Otherwise, the avenger of blood might pursue him in anger, overtake him if the distance is too far, and kill him, even though he was not deserving of death because he did not harbour hatred beforehand.

## Deuteronomy 19:7
Therefore, I instruct you to establish three cities for yourselves.

## Deuteronomy 19:8
If the Lord your God enlarges your territory, as He swore to your ancestors, and gives you all the land He promised,

## Deuteronomy 19:9
provided you carefully follow all these commandments I am giving you today, to love the Lord your God and to walk in His ways always, then you shall add three more cities for yourself, besides these three.

## Deuteronomy 19:10
Do this so that innocent blood will not be shed in your land, which the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance, and so you will not be guilty of bloodshed.

## Deuteronomy 19:11
But if someone hates his neighbour, lies in wait, assaults him and kills him, and then flees to one of these cities,

## Deuteronomy 19:12
the elders of his city shall send for him, and bring him back from there, and deliver him over to the avenger of blood to die.

## Deuteronomy 19:13
Do not show pity. You must purge from Israel the guilt of shedding innocent blood, so that it may go well with you.

## Deuteronomy 19:14
Do not move your neighbourâ€™s boundary stone set by your ancestors in the inheritance you receive in the land the Lord your God is giving you to possess.

## Deuteronomy 19:15
A single witness is not sufficient to convict anyone accused of any crime or offence they may have committed; a matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.

## Deuteronomy 19:16
If a malicious witness rises to accuse someone of wrongdoing,

## Deuteronomy 19:17
both parties to the dispute must stand in the presence of the Lord, before the priests and judges who are in office at that time.

## Deuteronomy 19:18
The judges must conduct a thorough investigation, and if the witness is proven to be false, giving false testimony against a fellow Israelite,

## Deuteronomy 19:19
then you shall do to the false witness as he intended to do to his brother. You must purge the evil from among you.

## Deuteronomy 19:20
The people will hear of this and be afraid, ensuring that such an evil thing is not repeated among you.

## Deuteronomy 19:21
Show no pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
