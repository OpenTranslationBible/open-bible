The priest shall then take the basket from your hand and set it down before the altar of the Lord your God.

## Deuteronomy 26:5
You shall then proclaim before the Lord your God: “My father was a wandering Aramean, and he journeyed to Egypt and lived there, few in number; but there he became a great, powerful, and populous nation.

## Deuteronomy 26:6
But the Egyptians treated us harshly, oppressed us, and subjected us to hard labour.

## Deuteronomy 26:7
Then we cried out to the Lord, the God of our fathers, and the Lord heard our voice and saw our distress, our toil, and our oppression.

The Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, with great terror, and with signs and wonders.

Then you, along with the Levites and the foreigners residing among you, shall rejoice in all the good things the Lord your God has granted you and your household.

## Deuteronomy 26:12
When you have completed setting aside a tenth of all your produce in the third year, the year of the tithe, you shall give it to the Levite, the foreigner, the orphan, and the widow, so they may eat in your towns and be satisfied.

## Deuteronomy 26:13
You shall then declare before the Lord your God: “I have removed the sacred portion from my house and have given it to the Levite, the foreigner, the orphan, and the widow, in accordance with all your commands. I have not deviated from your commandments nor have I forgotten them.

## Deuteronomy 26:14
I have not consumed any of it while in mourning, nor have I removed any of it while unclean, nor offered any of it to the dead. I have obeyed the Lord my God and have done everything you commanded me.

## Deuteronomy 26:15
Look down from your holy dwelling place in heaven, and bless your people Israel and the land you have given us, as you promised on oath to our ancestors, a land flowing with milk and honey.”
