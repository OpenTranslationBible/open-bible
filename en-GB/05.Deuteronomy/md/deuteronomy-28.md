## Deuteronomy 28:29

And you will grope at noon, just as the blind person gropes in the darkness, and you will not be successful in your ways; but you will only be oppressed and robbed all the time, with no one to save you.

## Deuteronomy 28:30

You will betroth a woman, but another man will violate her; you will build a house, but you will not live in it; you will plant a vineyard, but you will not use its fruit.

## Deuteronomy 28:31

Your ox will be slaughtered before your eyes, but you will not eat any of it; your donkey will be taken away from you and will not be returned to you; your sheep will be given to your enemies, and you will have no one to save you.

## Deuteronomy 28:32

Your sons and your daughters will be given to another people, while your eyes look on and long for them continually; but there will be nothing you can do.

## Deuteronomy 28:47

Since you did not serve the Lord your God with joy and a cheerful heart, in gratitude for the abundance of all things,

## Deuteronomy 28:48

Therefore you will serve your enemies whom the Lord will send against you, in hunger, in thirst, in nakedness, and in the lack of all things; and He will put an iron yoke on your neck until He has destroyed you.

## Deuteronomy 28:49

The Lord will bring a nation against you from far away, from the end of the earth, as the eagle swoops down—a nation whose language you will not understand,

## Deuteronomy 28:50

A nation with a defiant attitude, who will have no respect for the old, nor show favour to the young.

## Deuteronomy 28:51

And it will eat the offspring of your animals and the produce of your ground until you are destroyed; it will not leave you any grain, new wine, oil, the newborn of your herd, or the young of your flock until it has eliminated you.

## Deuteronomy 28:52

And it will besiege you in all your towns until your high and fortified walls in which you trusted come down throughout your land; and it will besiege you in all your towns throughout your land which the Lord your God has given you.

## Deuteronomy 28:53

Then you will eat the offspring of your own body, the flesh of your sons and of your daughters whom the Lord your God has given you, during the siege and the distress by which your enemy will oppress you.

## Deuteronomy 28:54

The man who is refined among you and very delicate will be hostile toward his brother, toward the wife he cherishes, and toward the rest of his children who remain,

## Deuteronomy 28:55

So that he will not give even one of them any of the flesh of his children which he will eat, because he has nothing else left, during the siege and the distress by which your enemy will oppress you in all your towns.

## Deuteronomy 28:56

The refined and delicate woman among you, who would not venture to set the sole of her foot on the ground because of her delicateness and refinement, will be hostile toward the husband she cherishes, toward her son, and daughter,

## Deuteronomy 28:57

And toward her afterbirth which comes out from between her legs, and toward her children to whom she gives birth; because she will eat them secretly for lack of anything else, during the siege and the distress by which your enemy will oppress you in your towns.

## Deuteronomy 28:58

If you are not careful to follow all the words of this Law that are written in this book, to fear this honoured and awesome name, the Lord your God,

## Deuteronomy 28:59

Then the Lord will bring extraordinary plagues on you and your descendants, severe and lasting plagues, and miserable and chronic sicknesses.

## Deuteronomy 28:60

And He will bring back upon you all the diseases of Egypt of which you were afraid, and they will cling to you.

## Deuteronomy 28:61

Also every sickness and every plague which is not written in the book of this Law, the Lord will bring on you until you are destroyed.

## Deuteronomy 28:62

Then you will be left few in number, whereas you were as numerous as the stars of heaven, because you did not obey the Lord your God.

## Deuteronomy 28:63

And it will come about that, just as the Lord delighted over you to make you prosperous and increase you, so the Lord will delight over you to make you perish and destroy you; and you will be torn away from the land which you are entering to possess.

## Deuteronomy 28:64

Furthermore, the Lord will scatter you among all the peoples, from one end of the earth to the other; and there you will serve other gods, made of wood and stone, which neither you nor your fathers have known.

## Deuteronomy 28:65

And among those nations you will find no rest, and there will be no resting place for the sole of your foot; but there the Lord will give you a trembling heart, failing of eyes, and despair of soul.

## Deuteronomy 28:66

So your life will hang in doubt before you; and you will be terrified night and day, and will have no assurance of your life.

## Deuteronomy 28:67

In the morning you will say, ‘If only it were evening!’ And in the evening you will say, ‘If only it were morning!’ because of the dread in your heart that you fear, and because of the sight of your eyes which you will see.

## Deuteronomy 28:68

And the Lord will bring you back to Egypt in ships, by the way about which I said to you, ‘You will never see it again!’ And there you will offer yourselves for sale to your enemies as male and female slaves, but there will be no buyer.”
