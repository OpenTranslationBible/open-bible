Even the most gentle and sensitive man among you will have no compassion on his own brother or the wife he loves or his surviving children,

You who were as numerous as the stars in the sky will be left but few in number, because you did not obey the Lord your God.

You will live in constant suspense, filled with dread both night and day, never sure of your life.

## Deuteronomy 28:68
The Lord will send you back in ships to Egypt on a journey I said you should never make again. There you will offer yourselves for sale to your enemies as male and female slaves, but no one will buy you.
