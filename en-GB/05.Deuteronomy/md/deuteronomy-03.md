# Deuteronomy Chapter 3

## Deuteronomy 3:1
Then we turned and went up the road towards Bashan, and Og, king of Bashan, came out with all his army to meet us in battle at Edrei.

## Deuteronomy 3:2
The Lord said to me, “Do not be afraid of him, for I have handed him over to you, along with all his army and his land. You shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon.”

## Deuteronomy 3:3
So the Lord our God delivered into our hands Og, king of Bashan, and all his people, and we struck them down until no survivors were left.

## Deuteronomy 3:4
At that time we captured all his cities; there was not a single city that we did not take from them—sixty cities, the entire region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.

## Deuteronomy 3:5
All these cities were fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, in addition to a great many unwalled villages.

## Deuteronomy 3:6
We completely destroyed them, as we had done with Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every city—men, women, and children.

## Deuteronomy 3:7
But all the livestock and the plunder from the cities we took for ourselves.

## Deuteronomy 3:8
At that time we took the land from the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the Valley of Arnon to Mount Hermon.

## Deuteronomy 3:9
(Hermon is called Sirion by the Sidonians, and the Amorites call it Senir.)

## Deuteronomy 3:10
We took all the cities of the plateau, all Gilead, and all Bashan as far as Salekah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.

## Deuteronomy 3:11
(Og king of Bashan was the last of the Rephaim. His bed was made of iron and was more than nine cubits long and four cubits wide. It is still in Rabbah of the Ammonites.)

## Deuteronomy 3:12
Of the land we took over at that time, I gave the Reubenites and the Gadites the territory north of Aroer by the Valley of Arnon, including half the hill country of Gilead, along with its cities.

## Deuteronomy 3:13
The rest of Gilead and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh. (The whole region of Argob in Bashan was known as a land of the Rephaim.)

## Deuteronomy 3:14
Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took the entire region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites; it was named after him, so that to this day Bashan is called Havvoth Jair.

## Deuteronomy 3:15
And I gave Gilead to Machir.

## Deuteronomy 3:16
To the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave the territory from Gilead to the Valley of Arnon (the middle of the valley being the border) and as far as the Jabbok River, which is the border of the Ammonites.

## Deuteronomy 3:17
Its western border was the Jordan in the Arabah, from Chinnereth to the Sea of the Arabah (that is, the Salt Sea), below the slopes of Pisgah.

## Deuteronomy 3:18
I commanded you at that time, saying, “The Lord your God has given you this land to possess it. All your valiant men, armed for battle, must cross over ahead of your fellow Israelites.

## Deuteronomy 3:19
However, your wives, your children, and your livestock (I know you have much livestock) may stay in the cities I have given you,

## Deuteronomy 3:20
until the Lord gives rest to your fellow Israelites as he has to you, and they too have taken possession of the land the Lord your God is giving them beyond the Jordan. Then each of you may return to the possession I have given you.”

## Deuteronomy 3:21
At that time I commanded Joshua, “Your eyes have seen all that the Lord your God has done to these two kings. The Lord will do the same to all the kingdoms into which you are going.

## Deuteronomy 3:22
Do not fear them; the Lord your God will fight on your behalf.”

## Deuteronomy 3:23
At that time I earnestly sought the Lord:

## Deuteronomy 3:24
“Lord God, you have begun to reveal to your servant your greatness and your mighty hand. For what god is there in heaven or on earth who can perform the deeds and mighty works you do?

## Deuteronomy 3:25
Please let me cross over and see the good land beyond the Jordan—that fine hill country and Lebanon.”

## Deuteronomy 3:26
But the Lord was angry with me on account of you and would not listen to me. “That is enough,” the Lord said. “Do not speak to me anymore about this matter.

## Deuteronomy 3:27
Go up to the top of Pisgah and look west, north, south, and east. Look at the land with your own eyes, since you are not going to cross this Jordan.

## Deuteronomy 3:28
But appoint Joshua, and encourage and strengthen him, for he will lead this people across and will enable them to inherit the land that you will see.”

## Deuteronomy 3:29
So we stayed in the valley opposite Beth Peor.
