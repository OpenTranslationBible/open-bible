# Deuteronomy Chapter 11

## Deuteronomy 11:1
Love the Lord your God, and always keep His requirements, His statutes, His ordinances, and His commandments.

## Deuteronomy 11:2
Know this day that I am not speaking with your children who have not known and have not seen the discipline of the Lord your God—His greatness, His mighty hand, and His outstretched arm,

## Deuteronomy 11:3
and the signs He performed and the deeds He did in the midst of Egypt to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and to all his land;

## Deuteronomy 11:4
and what He did to the Egyptian army, to its horses and chariots, when He made the waters of the Red Sea engulf them as they pursued you, and the Lord brought lasting ruin upon them;

## Deuteronomy 11:5
and what He did for you in the wilderness until you came to this place;

## Deuteronomy 11:6
and what He did to Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab, son of Reuben, when the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, their households, their tents, and every living thing that belonged to them, in the midst of all Israel—

## Deuteronomy 11:7
but it was your own eyes that saw all the great works the Lord has done.

## Deuteronomy 11:8
Therefore, observe all the commandments I am giving you today, so that you may have the strength to go in and take possession of the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess,

## Deuteronomy 11:9
and so that you may have a long life in the land the Lord promised to your ancestors and their descendants, a land abundant with milk and honey.

## Deuteronomy 11:10
For the land you are entering to take possession of is not like the land of Egypt, from which you came, where you sowed your seed and watered it by foot as in a vegetable garden.

## Deuteronomy 11:11
But the land you are crossing the Jordan to take possession of is a land of hills and valleys that receives rain from heaven.

## Deuteronomy 11:12
It is a land the Lord your God watches over; His eyes are continually upon it from the start of the year to its end.

## Deuteronomy 11:13
And it shall come to pass, if you faithfully obey the commandments I am giving you today, to love the Lord your God and to serve Him with all your heart and all your soul,

## Deuteronomy 11:14
that He will provide rain for your land in its season, both the early and late rains, so that you may gather in your grain, new wine, and olive oil.

## Deuteronomy 11:15
He will also provide grass in your fields for your cattle, and you will eat and be satisfied.

## Deuteronomy 11:16
Be careful, lest your hearts be deceived and you turn away and worship other gods and bow down to them.

## Deuteronomy 11:17
Then the Lord’s anger will be kindled against you, and He will shut up the heavens so that there will be no rain, and the ground will yield no produce, and you will quickly perish from the good land the Lord is giving you.

## Deuteronomy 11:18
Therefore, take these words of mine to heart and soul; tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads.

## Deuteronomy 11:19
Teach them to your children, speaking of them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up.

## Deuteronomy 11:20
Inscribe them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates,

## Deuteronomy 11:21
so that your days and the days of your children may be numerous in the land the Lord promised to give your ancestors, as numerous as the days that the heavens are above the earth.

## Deuteronomy 11:22
If you carefully observe all this commandment I am giving you to follow—to love the Lord your God, to walk in all His ways and to hold fast to Him—

## Deuteronomy 11:23
then the Lord will drive out all these nations before you, and you will take possession of nations greater and mightier than you.

## Deuteronomy 11:24
Every place where you set your foot will be yours: your territory will extend from the wilderness to Lebanon, and from the river Euphrates to the western sea.

## Deuteronomy 11:25
No one will be able to stand against you; the Lord your God will put the fear and dread of you on all the land, as He has promised you.

## Deuteronomy 11:26
Behold, I present to you today both a blessing and a curse:

## Deuteronomy 11:27
the blessing if you obey the commandments of the Lord your God that I am giving you today;

## Deuteronomy 11:28
and the curse if you do not obey the commandments of the Lord your God, but turn aside from the way I am commanding you today by following other gods, which you have not known.

## Deuteronomy 11:29
And it shall come to pass, when the Lord your God brings you into the land you are entering to possess, you shall proclaim the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal.

## Deuteronomy 11:30
Are they not across the Jordan, westward, toward the setting sun, in the land of the Canaanites living in the Arabah, opposite Gilgal, beside the great trees of Moreh?

## Deuteronomy 11:31
For you are about to cross the Jordan to go in and take possession of the land the Lord your God is giving you, and you shall possess it and live in it,

## Deuteronomy 11:32
and you shall be careful to obey all the statutes and judgments I am setting before you today.
