# Deuteronomy Chapter 11

## Deuteronomy 11:1
You shall love the Lord your God and always keep His charge—His statutes, judgments, and commandments.

## Deuteronomy 11:2
Know this today: I am not speaking to your children, who have not known or seen the discipline of the Lord your God—His greatness, mighty hand, and outstretched arm,

## Deuteronomy 11:3
the signs and the deeds He performed in Egypt against Pharaoh king of Egypt and his entire land,

## Deuteronomy 11:4
what He did to Egypt’s army, horses, and chariots—how He caused the waters of the Red Sea to cover them as they pursued you, and how He wiped them out forever.

## Deuteronomy 11:5
Remember what He did for you in the wilderness until you came to this place.

## Deuteronomy 11:6
Also what He did to Dathan and Abiram, sons of Eliab the Reubenite—how the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, their households, tents, and every living thing that followed them in the midst of all Israel.

## Deuteronomy 11:7
Your own eyes have seen all the great acts the Lord has done.

## Deuteronomy 11:8
So keep all the commands I give you today, so that you may have strength to go in and take possession of the land you are crossing into.

## Deuteronomy 11:9
And that you may live long in the land the Lord swore to give your ancestors and their descendants—a land flowing with milk and honey.

## Deuteronomy 11:10
The land you are entering is not like the land of Egypt, where you used to sow your seed and irrigate it by hand as in a vegetable garden.

## Deuteronomy 11:11
But the land you are crossing into is a land of hills and valleys, watered by rain from the heavens.

## Deuteronomy 11:12
It is a land the Lord your God cares for; the eyes of the Lord your God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year to its end.

## Deuteronomy 11:13
If you faithfully obey the commands I give you today—to love the Lord your God and to serve Him with all your heart and soul—

## Deuteronomy 11:14
then I will send rain on your land in its season—early and late rains—so that you may gather in your grain, new wine, and oil.

## Deuteronomy 11:15
I will provide grass in your fields for your livestock, and you will eat and be satisfied.

## Deuteronomy 11:16
But be careful, or your hearts will be led astray and you will turn aside to worship and serve other gods.

## Deuteronomy 11:17
Then the Lord’s anger will burn against you, and He will shut up the heavens so that there will be no rain, and the land will yield no produce, and you will soon perish from the good land the Lord is giving you.

## Deuteronomy 11:18
So fix these words of mine in your hearts and minds. Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads.

## Deuteronomy 11:19
Teach them to your children, speaking of them when you sit at home, when you walk along the way, when you lie down, and when you get up.

## Deuteronomy 11:20
Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates,

## Deuteronomy 11:21
so that your days and the days of your children may be many in the land the Lord swore to give your ancestors—as many as the days the heavens are above the earth.

## Deuteronomy 11:22
If you carefully keep all these commands I am giving you—to love the Lord your God, to walk in His ways and hold fast to Him—

## Deuteronomy 11:23
then the Lord will drive out all these nations before you, and you will dispossess nations larger and stronger than you.

## Deuteronomy 11:24
Every place the sole of your foot treads will be yours. Your territory will extend from the wilderness to Lebanon, and from the Euphrates River to the Mediterranean Sea.

## Deuteronomy 11:25
No one will be able to stand against you. The Lord your God will cause people everywhere to fear you, as He promised.

## Deuteronomy 11:26
See, I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse—

## Deuteronomy 11:27
a blessing, if you obey the commandments of the Lord your God that I am giving you today;

## Deuteronomy 11:28
and a curse, if you disobey the commandments of the Lord your God and turn aside from the way I command you today, to follow other gods you have not known.

## Deuteronomy 11:29
When the Lord your God brings you into the land you are entering, you shall pronounce the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal.

## Deuteronomy 11:30
Are they not across the Jordan, west of the road, toward the setting sun, in the land of the Canaanites who live in the Arabah, opposite Gilgal near the oaks of Moreh?

## Deuteronomy 11:31
For you are about to cross the Jordan and enter to possess the land the Lord your God is giving you. When you take possession of it and settle in it,

## Deuteronomy 11:32
be sure to follow all the statutes and laws I am setting before you today.
