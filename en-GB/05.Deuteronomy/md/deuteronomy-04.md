# Deuteronomy Chapter 4

## Deuteronomy 4:1

Now, Israel, listen to the statutes and decrees I am about to teach you to follow, so that you may live and enter and take possession of the land that the Lord, the God of your ancestors, is giving you.

## Deuteronomy 4:2

Do not add to the word which I command you, nor take away from it, so that you may keep the commandments of the Lord your God that I am giving you.

## Deuteronomy 4:3

You have seen with your own eyes what the Lord did concerning Baal Peor, for the Lord your God destroyed from among you all who followed Baal Peor.

## Deuteronomy 4:4

But all of you who held fast to the Lord your God are alive today, every one of you.

## Deuteronomy 4:5

See, I have taught you statutes and decrees as the Lord my God commanded me, so that you may follow them in the land you are entering to possess.

## Deuteronomy 4:6

Observe them carefully, for this will show your wisdom and understanding to the nations, who will hear about all these statutes and say, “Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.”

## Deuteronomy 4:7

What other nation is so great as to have a god so near to them as the Lord our God is to us whenever we call upon Him?

## Deuteronomy 4:8

And what other nation is so great as to have such righteous statutes and decrees as this body of laws I am setting before you today?

## Deuteronomy 4:9

Only be careful, and watch over yourselves diligently, so that you do not forget the things your eyes have seen or let them fade from your heart as long as you live. Make them known to your children and to their children after them.

## Deuteronomy 4:10

Remember the day you stood before the Lord your God at Horeb, when He said to me, “Assemble the people before me to hear my words so that they may learn to revere me all the days they live on the earth and may teach them to their children.”

## Deuteronomy 4:11

You approached and stood at the base of the mountain, which was ablaze with fire reaching to the heavens, surrounded by black clouds and deep darkness.

## Deuteronomy 4:12

Then the Lord spoke to you from the midst of the fire; you heard the sound of words but saw no form—there was only a voice.

## Deuteronomy 4:13

He declared to you his covenant, the Ten Commandments, which He commanded you to follow and wrote them on two stone tablets.

## Deuteronomy 4:14

And the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and decrees, that you might follow them in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess.

## Deuteronomy 4:15

Be very careful, since you saw no form on the day the Lord spoke to you at Horeb out of the fire.

## Deuteronomy 4:16

So that you do not become corrupt and make for yourselves an idol, an image of any shape, whether in the form of a man or a woman,

## Deuteronomy 4:17

or in the form of any animal on the earth or any bird that flies in the air,

## Deuteronomy 4:18

or in the form of any creature that moves along the ground or any fish in the waters below.

## Deuteronomy 4:19

And when you look up to the sky and see the sun, the moon, and the stars—all the heavenly array—do not be enticed into bowing down to them and worshipping things the Lord your God has apportioned to all the nations under heaven.

## Deuteronomy 4:20

But as for you, the Lord took you and brought you out of the iron-smelting furnace, out of Egypt, to be a people of His own inheritance, as you are today.

## Deuteronomy 4:21

The Lord was angry with me because of you, and He swore that I would not cross the Jordan and enter the good land the Lord your God is giving you as your inheritance.

## Deuteronomy 4:22

I will remain in this land; I will not cross the Jordan; but you are about to cross over and take possession of that good land.

## Deuteronomy 4:23

Be diligent not to forget the covenant of the Lord your God that He made with you; do not create an idol in any form that the Lord your God has forbidden.

## Deuteronomy 4:24

For the Lord your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.

## Deuteronomy 4:25

After you have had children and grandchildren and have lived in the land a long time—if you then become corrupt and create any kind of idol, doing what is evil in the eyes of the Lord your God and provoking His anger,

## Deuteronomy 4:26

I call the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you today that you will quickly perish from the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess. You will not live there long but will certainly be destroyed.

## Deuteronomy 4:27

The Lord will disperse you among the peoples, and only a few of you will remain among the nations to which the Lord will drive you.

## Deuteronomy 4:28

There you will serve gods made by human hands, of wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or eat or smell.

## Deuteronomy 4:29

But if from there you seek the Lord your God, you will find Him if you search for Him with all your heart and with all your soul.

## Deuteronomy 4:30

When you are in distress and all these things have happened to you, then in later days you will return to the Lord your God and obey His voice.

## Deuteronomy 4:31

For the Lord your God is a compassionate God; He will not abandon or destroy you or forget the covenant with your ancestors, which He confirmed to them by oath.

## Deuteronomy 4:32

Ask now about the former days, long before your time, from the day God created humankind on the earth; ask from one end of the heavens to the other. Has anything so great as this ever happened, or has anything like it ever been heard of?

## Deuteronomy 4:33

Has any other people heard the voice of God speaking out of fire, as you have, and survived?

## Deuteronomy 4:34

Has any god ever attempted to take for Himself one nation out of another nation, by trials, by signs and wonders, by war, by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, or by great and awesome deeds, like all the things the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before your very eyes?

## Deuteronomy 4:35

You were shown these things so that you might know that the Lord is God; apart from Him there is no other.

## Deuteronomy 4:36

From heaven He made you hear His voice to instruct you. On earth He showed you His great fire, and you heard His words from out of the fire.

## Deuteronomy 4:37

Due to His love for your ancestors and His choice of their descendants, He brought you out of Egypt by His Presence and His great strength,

## Deuteronomy 4:38

to drive out before you nations greater and mightier than you and to bring you into their land to give it to you for your inheritance, as it is today.

## Deuteronomy 4:39

Recognise and take to heart this day that the Lord is God in heaven above and on the earth below. There is no other.

## Deuteronomy 4:40

Keep His statutes and commandments, which I am giving you today, so that it may go well with you and your children after you and that you may live long in the land the Lord your God gives you for all time.

## Deuteronomy 4:41

At that time, Moses appointed three cities east of the Jordan,

## Deuteronomy 4:42

to which anyone who had killed a person could flee if they had unintentionally killed a neighbour without prior intent. They could flee into one of these cities and preserve their life.

## Deuteronomy 4:43

The cities were as follows: Bezer in the wilderness plateau, for the Reubenites; Ramoth in Gilead, for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites.

## Deuteronomy 4:44

This is the law Moses presented to the Israelites.

## Deuteronomy 4:45

These are the testimonies, statutes, and ordinances Moses gave them when they came out of Egypt

## Deuteronomy 4:46

and were in the valley near Beth Peor, east of the Jordan, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon and was defeated by Moses and the Israelites as they came out of Egypt.

## Deuteronomy 4:47

They took possession of his land along with the territory of Og king of Bashan, the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan.

## Deuteronomy 4:48

This land extended from Aroer on the edge of the Arnon Gorge to Mount Sirion (that is, Hermon),

## Deuteronomy 4:49

and included all the Arabah east of the Jordan, as far as the Sea of the Arabah, below the slopes of Pisgah.
