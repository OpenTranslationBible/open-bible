# Deuteronomy Chapter 1

## Deuteronomy 1:1
These are the words Moses addressed to all Israel across the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab.

## Deuteronomy 1:2
It is an eleven-day journey from Horeb by way of Mount Seir to Kadesh Barnea.

## Deuteronomy 1:3
In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses spoke to the Israelites, in accordance with all that the Lord had commanded him to declare to them,

## Deuteronomy 1:4
after he had defeated Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth and Edrei.

## Deuteronomy 1:5
Across the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses began to explain this law, saying,

## Deuteronomy 1:6
“The Lord our God said to us at Horeb, ‘You have stayed long enough at this mountain.

## Deuteronomy 1:7
Turn and set out on your journey, and go to the hill country of the Amorites, and to all their neighbours in the Arabah, in the hill country, in the lowlands, in the Negev, by the seacoast, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the Euphrates.

## Deuteronomy 1:8
See, I have placed the land before you; go in and take possession of the land which the Lord swore to give to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and to their descendants after them.’

## Deuteronomy 1:9
“At that time I said to you, ‘I am not able to bear the burden of you alone.

## Deuteronomy 1:10
The Lord your God has multiplied you, and behold, today you are as numerous as the stars in the sky.

## Deuteronomy 1:11
May the Lord, the God of your ancestors, increase you a thousand times more and bless you, just as He has promised!

## Deuteronomy 1:12
But how can I alone bear the weight of your problems, burdens, and disputes?

## Deuteronomy 1:13
Select for yourselves wise, discerning, and respected men from each of your tribes, and I will appoint them as your leaders.’

## Deuteronomy 1:14
And you answered me, ‘What you propose to do is good.’

## Deuteronomy 1:15
So I took the leading men of your tribes, wise and respected, and appointed them as leaders over you, commanders of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens, and officers for your tribes.

## Deuteronomy 1:16
“Then I charged your judges at that time, saying, ‘Hear the cases between your people and judge fairly, whether the case is between two Israelites or between an Israelite and a foreigner residing among you.

## Deuteronomy 1:17
Do not show partiality in judgment; hear both small and great alike. Do not be afraid of anyone, for the judgment is God's. Bring any case too difficult for you to me, and I will hear it.’

## Deuteronomy 1:18
At that time I commanded you all the things you were to do.

## Deuteronomy 1:19
“Then we set out from Horeb and went through all that vast and dreadful wilderness that you saw, on the way to the hill country of the Amorites, as the Lord our God had commanded us, and we reached Kadesh Barnea.

## Deuteronomy 1:20
And I said to you, ‘You have reached the hill country of the Amorites, which the Lord our God is giving us.

## Deuteronomy 1:21
See, the Lord your God has placed the land before you; go up and take possession of it, just as the Lord, the God of your ancestors, has spoken to you. Do not be afraid or discouraged.’

## Deuteronomy 1:22
“Then all of you came to me and said, ‘Let us send men ahead of us to spy out the land and bring back a report about the route we are to take and the towns we will come to.’

## Deuteronomy 1:23
The plan seemed good to me, so I selected twelve of you, one man for each tribe.

## Deuteronomy 1:24
They set out and went up into the hill country, and came to the Valley of Eshkol and explored it.

## Deuteronomy 1:25
Taking with them some of the fruit of the land, they brought it down to us and reported, ‘The land that the Lord our God is giving us is good.’

## Deuteronomy 1:26
Yet you were unwilling to go up; you rebelled against the command of the Lord your God.

## Deuteronomy 1:27
You grumbled in your tents and said, ‘Because the Lord hates us, He has brought us out of Egypt to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites to destroy us.

## Deuteronomy 1:28
Where can we go? Our brothers have made our hearts melt, saying, “The people are stronger and taller than we are; the cities are large and fortified up to heaven. We even saw the Anakites there.”’

## Deuteronomy 1:29
Then I said to you, ‘Do not be terrified or afraid of them.

## Deuteronomy 1:30
The Lord your God, who goes before you, will fight for you, just as He did for you in Egypt before your eyes,

## Deuteronomy 1:31
and in the wilderness where you saw how the Lord your God carried you, as a father carries his son, all the way you went until you reached this place.’

## Deuteronomy 1:32
Yet in spite of this, you did not trust the Lord your God,

## Deuteronomy 1:33
who went ahead of you on your journey, to seek out places for you to camp, in fire by night and in a cloud by day, to show you the way you should go.

## Deuteronomy 1:34
When the Lord heard what you said, He was angry and swore an oath:

## Deuteronomy 1:35
‘Not one of this evil generation shall see the good land I swore to give your ancestors,

## Deuteronomy 1:36
except Caleb son of Jephunneh. He will see it, and I will give him and his descendants the land he set his feet on, because he followed the Lord wholeheartedly.’

## Deuteronomy 1:37
The Lord was also angry with me because of you, saying, ‘You shall not enter it, either.

## Deuteronomy 1:38
Joshua son of Nun, who stands before you, will enter it. Encourage him, for he will lead Israel to inherit it.

## Deuteronomy 1:39
Moreover, your little ones whom you said would be taken captive, your children who do not yet know good from bad, they will enter the land. I will give it to them, and they will take possession of it.

## Deuteronomy 1:40
But as for you, turn around and set out toward the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.’

## Deuteronomy 1:41
“Then you replied, ‘We have sinned against the Lord. We will go up and fight, as the Lord our God commanded us.’ So each of you put on his weapons, thinking it easy to go up into the hill country.

## Deuteronomy 1:42
But the Lord said to me, ‘Tell them, “Do not go up and fight, for I am not among you; otherwise, you will be defeated by your enemies.”’

## Deuteronomy 1:43
So I spoke to you, but you would not listen. You rebelled against the Lord’s command and acted presumptuously and went up into the hill country.

## Deuteronomy 1:44
The Amorites who lived in those hills came out against you; they chased you like a swarm of bees and beat you down from Seir to Hormah.

## Deuteronomy 1:45
You returned and wept before the Lord, but He paid no attention to your weeping and turned a deaf ear to you.

## Deuteronomy 1:46
So you stayed in Kadesh many days—all the time you spent there.
