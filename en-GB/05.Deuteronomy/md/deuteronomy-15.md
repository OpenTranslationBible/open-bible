# Deuteronomy Chapter 15

## Deuteronomy 15:1
At the end of every seven years, you shall grant a release of debts.

## Deuteronomy 15:2
This is the manner of the release: every creditor shall forgive what he has lent to his neighbour; he shall not demand it from his fellow Israelite, for the Lord's time of release has been proclaimed.

## Deuteronomy 15:3
You may demand payment from a foreigner, but you must forgive whatever your brother owes you.

## Deuteronomy 15:4
There should be no poor among you, for the Lord will bless you in the land that He is giving you as an inheritance to possess,

## Deuteronomy 15:5
if only you carefully listen to the voice of the Lord your God and observe all these commandments that I am giving you today.

## Deuteronomy 15:6
The Lord your God will bless you as He has promised, and you will lend to many nations but will not borrow; you will rule over many nations, but they will not rule over you.

## Deuteronomy 15:7
If there is a poor person among you, one of your fellow Israelites, in any of the towns of the land that the Lord your God is giving you, do not harden your heart or close your hand against your poor brother.

## Deuteronomy 15:8
Instead, open your hand freely to him and lend him whatever he needs.

## Deuteronomy 15:9
Be careful not to harbour this wicked thought: 'The seventh year, the year of release, is near,' so that you show ill will towards your needy brother and give him nothing. He may then appeal to the Lord against you, and you will be guilty of sin.

## Deuteronomy 15:10
You shall give generously to him, and your heart shall not be grudging when you give to him, because for this the Lord your God will bless you in all your work and in all that you undertake.

## Deuteronomy 15:11
For the poor will never cease to be in the land; therefore I command you to open your hand freely to your brother, to your needy and poor in your land.

## Deuteronomy 15:12
If your fellow Hebrew, a man or a woman, is sold to you and serves you for six years, then in the seventh year you must let them go free.

## Deuteronomy 15:13
And when you release them, do not send them away empty-handed.

## Deuteronomy 15:14
Provide them generously from your flock, your threshing floor, and your winepress. Give to them as the Lord your God has blessed you.

## Deuteronomy 15:15
Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and the Lord your God redeemed you; that is why I am giving you this command today.

## Deuteronomy 15:16
But if your servant says to you, 'I will not leave you,' because he loves you and your household and is well off with you,

## Deuteronomy 15:17
then take an awl and pierce it through his ear into the door, and he shall be your servant for life. Do the same for your female servant.

## Deuteronomy 15:18
Do not consider it a hardship to set your servant free, because their service to you these six years has been worth twice as much as that of a hired worker. The Lord your God will bless you in all that you do.

## Deuteronomy 15:19
Consecrate to the Lord your God all the firstborn males of your herds and flocks. Do not work with the firstborn of your cattle, nor shear the firstborn of your sheep.

## Deuteronomy 15:20
You and your household shall eat them each year in the presence of the Lord your God at the place He will choose.

## Deuteronomy 15:21
If an animal has any defect, is lame or blind, or has any serious flaw, you must not sacrifice it to the Lord your God.

## Deuteronomy 15:22
You may eat it within your towns. Both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat it, as if it were gazelle or deer.

## Deuteronomy 15:23
But you must not eat the blood; pour it out on the ground like water.
