# Deuteronomy Chapter 18

## Deuteronomy 18:1
The Levitical priests—indeed the whole tribe of Levi—shall have no portion or inheritance with Israel. They shall eat the offerings made to the Lord by fire, for that is their inheritance.

## Deuteronomy 18:2
They shall have no inheritance among their fellow Israelites. The Lord is their inheritance, as He promised them.

## Deuteronomy 18:3
This shall be the priests’ due from the people: those who offer a sacrifice, whether an ox or sheep, must give the priest the shoulder, the cheeks, and the stomach.

## Deuteronomy 18:4
You are also to give him the firstfruits of your grain, new wine, and oil, and the first shearing of your sheep.

## Deuteronomy 18:5
For the Lord your God has chosen him and his descendants out of all your tribes to stand and minister in the Lord’s name forever.

## Deuteronomy 18:6
If a Levite leaves one of your towns in Israel where he has been staying and comes, whenever he desires, to the place the Lord chooses,

## Deuteronomy 18:7
then he may minister in the name of the Lord his God like all his fellow Levites who stand there before the Lord.

## Deuteronomy 18:8
They shall share equally in their benefits, aside from what they receive from the sale of their family possessions.

## Deuteronomy 18:9
When you enter the land the Lord your God is giving you, do not learn to imitate the detestable practices of those nations.

## Deuteronomy 18:10
Let no one be found among you who sacrifices their son or daughter in the fire, or who practices divination, sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft,

## Deuteronomy 18:11
casts spells, or is a medium, spiritist, or consults the dead.

## Deuteronomy 18:12
Everyone who does these things is detestable to the Lord, and because of these detestable practices the Lord your God is driving those nations out before you.

## Deuteronomy 18:13
You must be blameless before the Lord your God.

## Deuteronomy 18:14
The nations you will dispossess listen to those who practice sorcery and divination, but the Lord your God has not permitted you to do so.

## Deuteronomy 18:15
The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among you, from your fellow Israelites. You must listen to him.

## Deuteronomy 18:16
This is what you asked of the Lord your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly when you said, ‘Let me not hear the voice of the Lord my God or see this great fire anymore, or I will die.’

## Deuteronomy 18:17
The Lord said to me, ‘What they have said is good.

## Deuteronomy 18:18
I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers. I will put My words in his mouth, and he will speak to them everything I command him.

## Deuteronomy 18:19
I will hold accountable anyone who does not listen to My words that he speaks in My name.

## Deuteronomy 18:20
But a prophet who presumes to speak a word in My name that I have not commanded him to speak, or who speaks in the name of other gods, must be put to death.

## Deuteronomy 18:21
You may ask in your heart, ‘How can we recognise a message the Lord has not spoken?’

## Deuteronomy 18:22
If what a prophet proclaims in the name of the Lord does not happen or come to pass, that is a message the Lord has not spoken. The prophet has spoken presumptuously. Do not be afraid of him.
