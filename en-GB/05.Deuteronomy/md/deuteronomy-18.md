# Deuteronomy Chapter 18

## Deuteronomy 18:1
The Levitical priests, indeed the entire tribe of Levi, shall have no portion or inheritance with Israel; they will live on the offerings made by fire to the Lord, for that is their inheritance.

## Deuteronomy 18:2
They shall not have an inheritance among their fellow Israelites; the Lord is their portion, as He promised them.

## Deuteronomy 18:3
This is the portion due to the priests from the people who offer a sacrifice, be it an ox or a sheep: the shoulder, the two cheeks, and the stomach.

## Deuteronomy 18:4
You shall give them the firstfruits of your grain, new wine, and olive oil, and the first fleece from the shearing of your sheep.

## Deuteronomy 18:5
For the Lord your God has chosen them and their descendants from all your tribes to stand and minister in the name of the Lord always.

## Deuteronomy 18:6
If a Levite comes from any of your towns throughout Israel where he resides, and comes whenever he desires to the place the Lord chooses,

## Deuteronomy 18:7
he may minister in the name of the Lord his God like all his fellow Levites who stand there before the Lord.

## Deuteronomy 18:8
They shall share equally in the benefits, except for what they receive from the sale of family possessions.

## Deuteronomy 18:9
When you enter the land the Lord your God is giving you, do not learn to imitate the detestable practices of those nations.

## Deuteronomy 18:10
Let no one be found among you who makes his son or daughter pass through the fire, who practises divination, or sorcery, interprets omens, or engages in witchcraft,

## Deuteronomy 18:11
or performs enchantments, or who is a medium or spiritist, or who seeks guidance from the dead.

## Deuteronomy 18:12
For whoever does these things is detestable to the Lord; and because of these detestable practices, the Lord your God will drive out those nations before you.

## Deuteronomy 18:13
You must conduct yourselves with complete integrity before the Lord your God.

## Deuteronomy 18:14
The nations you will dispossess listen to soothsayers and diviners, but as for you, the Lord your God has not permitted you to do so.

## Deuteronomy 18:15
The Lord your God will appoint for you a prophet like me from among you, from your fellow Israelites; you must heed him.

## Deuteronomy 18:16
This is in accordance with what you asked of the Lord your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly, when you said, “Let us not hear the voice of the Lord our God nor see this great fire anymore, or we will die.”

## Deuteronomy 18:17
The Lord said to me, “Their words are good.

## Deuteronomy 18:18
I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their fellow Israelites, and I will put my words in his mouth, and he will speak to them everything I command him.

## Deuteronomy 18:19
And it shall be that whoever does not listen to my words which he speaks in my name, I myself will call to account.

## Deuteronomy 18:20
But a prophet who presumes to speak in my name anything I have not commanded, or who speaks in the name of other gods, that prophet shall die.”

## Deuteronomy 18:21
You may ask yourselves, “How can we recognise a message the Lord has not spoken?”

## Deuteronomy 18:22
If what a prophet proclaims in the name of the Lord does not happen or come true, that is a message the Lord has not spoken. The prophet has spoken presumptuously; do not be afraid of him.
