# Deuteronomy Chapter 22

## Deuteronomy 22:1
If you see your compatriot’s ox or sheep wandering off, do not ignore it; you must certainly return it to your compatriot.

## Deuteronomy 22:2
If your compatriot does not live near you or you do not know who owns it, take it to your house and keep it with you until they come to claim it. Then you shall return it.

## Deuteronomy 22:3
You must do the same with their donkey, their cloak, or any lost property of your compatriot that you find. Do not ignore it.

## Deuteronomy 22:4
If you see your compatriot’s donkey or ox fallen on the road, do not ignore it. You must help them to get it back on its feet.

## Deuteronomy 22:5
A woman shall not wear a man’s clothing, nor shall a man put on a woman’s clothing, for the Lord your God finds anyone who does this detestable.

## Deuteronomy 22:6
If you come across a bird’s nest beside the road, in a tree or on the ground, with the mother sitting on the young or on the eggs, do not take the mother along with the young.

## Deuteronomy 22:7
You may take the young, but you must let the mother go, so that it may be well with you and you may have a long life.

## Deuteronomy 22:8
When you build a new house, you must make a parapet for your roof, so that you will not bring the guilt of bloodshed on your house if anyone falls from it.

## Deuteronomy 22:9
Do not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed, or the whole yield, both the crop you plant and the fruit of the vineyard, will be defiled.

## Deuteronomy 22:10
Avoid ploughing with an ox and a donkey harnessed together.

## Deuteronomy 22:11
Do not wear clothes made of wool and linen woven together.

## Deuteronomy 22:12
Attach tassels to the four corners of the cloak you wear.

## Deuteronomy 22:13
If a man takes a wife and, after being with her, turns against her

## Deuteronomy 22:14
and falsely accuses her, giving her a bad name, saying, “I took this woman, but when I approached her, I did not find evidence of her virginity,”

## Deuteronomy 22:15
then the girl’s father and mother shall bring proof of the girl’s virginity to the elders at the city gate.

## Deuteronomy 22:16
The girl’s father shall say to the elders, “I gave my daughter to this man as a wife, but he has turned against her.

## Deuteronomy 22:17
Now he has accused her, saying, ‘I did not find your daughter to be a virgin.’ But here is the proof of my daughter’s virginity.” Then they shall display the cloth before the city elders,

## Deuteronomy 22:18
and the elders shall take action against the man and discipline him.

## Deuteronomy 22:19
They shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver and give them to the girl’s father, because this man has slandered an Israelite virgin. She shall remain his wife; he must not divorce her as long as he lives.

## Deuteronomy 22:20
If, however, the charge is true and no proof of the girl’s virginity can be found,

## Deuteronomy 22:21
she shall be brought to the door of her father’s house and the men of her city shall stone her to death. She has committed a disgraceful act in Israel by being promiscuous in her father’s house. You must purge the evil from among you.

## Deuteronomy 22:22
If a man is found lying with a married woman, both the man who lay with her and the woman must die. You must purge the evil from Israel.

## Deuteronomy 22:23
If a virgin pledged to be married is found in the city by another man, and he lies with her,

## Deuteronomy 22:24
you shall bring both of them to the city gate and stone them to death—the girl because she did not cry out for help, being in the city, and the man because he violated his neighbour’s wife. You must purge the evil from among you.

## Deuteronomy 22:25
But if a man finds a betrothed girl in the countryside and forces her, only the man who has done this shall die.

## Deuteronomy 22:26
Do nothing to the girl; she has committed no sin deserving death. This case is like that of someone who attacks and murders a neighbour,

## Deuteronomy 22:27
for the man found her in the countryside, and though the betrothed girl cried for help, there was no one to rescue her.

## Deuteronomy 22:28
If a man finds a virgin who is not pledged to be married and forces her, and they are discovered,

## Deuteronomy 22:29
he shall pay her father fifty shekels of silver. He must marry the girl, for he has violated her. He can never divorce her as long as he lives.

## Deuteronomy 22:30
A man shall not marry his father’s wife, for that would dishonour his father’s bed.
