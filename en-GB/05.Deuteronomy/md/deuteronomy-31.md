# Deuteronomy Chapter 31

## Deuteronomy 31:1
Then Moses went and addressed these words to all Israel:

## Deuteronomy 31:2
He said to them, “I am now one hundred and twenty years old; I am no longer able to lead you, and the Lord has told me, ‘You shall not cross the Jordan.’

## Deuteronomy 31:3
The Lord your God will cross over ahead of you. He will destroy these nations before you, and you will take possession of their land. Joshua will also cross over ahead of you, as the Lord has spoken.

## Deuteronomy 31:4
And the Lord will do to them as He did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, when He destroyed them and their land.

## Deuteronomy 31:5
The Lord will hand them over to you, and you shall do to them according to all the commandments I have given you.

## Deuteronomy 31:6
Be strong and courageous. Do not fear or be terrified of them, for the Lord your God goes with you; He will not leave you nor forsake you.”

## Deuteronomy 31:7
Then Moses called Joshua and said to him in the presence of all Israel, “Be strong and courageous, for you will go with this people into the land that the Lord swore to their ancestors to give them, and you will divide it among them as their inheritance.

## Deuteronomy 31:8
The Lord Himself goes before you and will be with you; He will not leave you nor forsake you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged.”

## Deuteronomy 31:9
So Moses wrote this law and gave it to the Levitical priests, who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and to all the elders of Israel.

## Deuteronomy 31:10
Then Moses commanded them, “At the end of every seven years, during the year of debt release, at the Festival of Tabernacles,

## Deuteronomy 31:11
when all Israel comes to appear before the Lord your God at the place He will choose, you shall read this law before them so that they may hear it.

## Deuteronomy 31:12
Gather the people—men, women, children, and the foreigners residing in your towns—so they may listen and learn to fear the Lord your God and carefully follow all the words of this law.

## Deuteronomy 31:13
Their children, who do not know this law, must hear it and learn to fear the Lord your God as long as you live in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess.”

## Deuteronomy 31:14
The Lord said to Moses, “The time of your death is near. Call Joshua and present yourselves at the tent of meeting, where I will commission him.” So Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves at the tent of meeting.

## Deuteronomy 31:15
The Lord appeared at the tent in a pillar of cloud, and the cloud stood at the entrance of the tent.

## Deuteronomy 31:16
The Lord said to Moses: “You are about to rest with your ancestors, and this people will soon turn to foreign gods of the land they are entering. They will forsake Me and break the covenant I made with them.

## Deuteronomy 31:17
On that day, My anger will be kindled against them, and I will forsake them and hide My face from them, and they will be consumed. Many disasters and calamities will come upon them, and they will say, ‘Have not these disasters come upon us because our God is not with us?’

## Deuteronomy 31:18
I will surely hide My face on that day because of all the evil they have done in turning to other gods.

## Deuteronomy 31:19
“Now write down this song and teach it to the Israelites; put it on their lips, so that it may be a witness for Me against them.

## Deuteronomy 31:20
When I bring them into the land flowing with milk and honey, the land I promised on oath to their ancestors, and they eat and are satisfied and become prosperous, they will turn to other gods and worship them, rejecting Me and breaking My covenant.

## Deuteronomy 31:21
When many disasters and calamities come upon them, this song will testify against them, because it will not be forgotten by their descendants. I know what they are inclined to do, even before I bring them into the land I promised them on oath.”

## Deuteronomy 31:22
So Moses wrote down this song that day and taught it to the Israelites.

## Deuteronomy 31:23
The Lord commissioned Joshua son of Nun, saying, “Be strong and courageous, for you will bring the Israelites into the land I promised them on oath, and I will be with you.”

## Deuteronomy 31:24
After Moses finished writing the words of this law in a book from beginning to end,

## Deuteronomy 31:25
he gave this command to the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord:

## Deuteronomy 31:26
“Take this Book of the Law and place it beside the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God. There it will remain as a witness against you.

## Deuteronomy 31:27
For I know how rebellious and stiff-necked you are. If you have been rebellious against the Lord while I am still alive with you, how much more will you rebel after my death?

## Deuteronomy 31:28
Assemble all the elders of your tribes and your officials before me, so that I may speak these words in their hearing and call the heavens and the earth to witness against them.

## Deuteronomy 31:29
For I know that after my death you will act corruptly and turn from the way I have commanded you. In days to come, disaster will fall on you because you will do evil in the sight of the Lord, provoking Him to anger by what your hands have made.”

## Deuteronomy 31:30
And Moses recited the words of this song from beginning to end in the hearing of the whole assembly of Israel:
