# Deuteronomy Chapter 24

## Deuteronomy 24:1
When a man marries a woman, and she does not find favour in his eyes because he has discovered some indecency in her, he may write her a certificate of divorce, place it in her hand, and send her away from his house.

## Deuteronomy 24:2
If she departs from his house and becomes another man's wife,

## Deuteronomy 24:3
and if her second husband dislikes her and writes her a certificate of divorce, places it in her hand, and sends her away from his house, or if he dies,

## Deuteronomy 24:4
then her first husband, who sent her away, is not permitted to take her again as his wife after she has been defiled. This would be an abomination before the Lord, and you must not bring sin upon the land the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance.

## Deuteronomy 24:5
When a man takes a new wife, he shall not go out with the army or be assigned any duty. He shall be free to remain at home for one year and bring happiness to the wife he has married.

## Deuteronomy 24:6
Do not take a handmill or even the upper millstone as security for a debt, for that would be taking someone's livelihood as a pledge.

## Deuteronomy 24:7
If anyone is found kidnapping a fellow Israelite and treating them as merchandise or selling them, that kidnapper shall die. You must purge the evil from among you.

## Deuteronomy 24:8
Be very careful in cases of defiling skin diseases to do exactly as the Levitical priests instruct you. Follow carefully what I have commanded them.

## Deuteronomy 24:9
Recall what happened to Miriam by the Lord your God during your journey out of Egypt.

## Deuteronomy 24:10
When you make a loan of any kind to your neighbour, do not enter their house to collect the pledge.

## Deuteronomy 24:11
Stand outside, and let the person to whom you are lending bring the pledge out to you.

## Deuteronomy 24:12
If the person is poor, do not sleep with their pledge in your possession.

## Deuteronomy 24:13
Return their cloak by sunset so that they may sleep in it and bless you; this will be considered a righteous act before the Lord your God.

## Deuteronomy 24:14
Do not exploit a hired worker who is poor and needy, whether they are a fellow Israelite or a foreigner residing in your towns.

## Deuteronomy 24:15
Pay them their wages each day before sunset, for they are poor and depend on it. Otherwise, they may cry out to the Lord against you, and you will be guilty of sin.

## Deuteronomy 24:16
Parents shall not be put to death for their children, nor children for their parents; each shall die for their own sin.

## Deuteronomy 24:17
Do not pervert the justice due to the foreigner or the fatherless, nor take a widow's cloak as a pledge.

## Deuteronomy 24:18
Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the Lord your God redeemed you from there; that is why I command you to do this.

## Deuteronomy 24:19
When you harvest in your field and forget a sheaf, do not return to get it. Leave it for the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow, so that the Lord your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.

## Deuteronomy 24:20
When you gather olives from your trees, do not go over the branches a second time. Leave what remains for the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow.

## Deuteronomy 24:21
When you gather the grapes from your vineyard, do not go over the vines again. Leave what remains for the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow.

## Deuteronomy 24:22
Remember that you were slaves in the land of Egypt; therefore, I command you to do this.
