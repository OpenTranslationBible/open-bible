# Jude Chapter 1

## Jude 1:1
Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James, to those who are called, cherished by God the Father, and preserved for Jesus Christ:

## Jude 1:2
May you be richly blessed with mercy, peace, and love.

## Jude 1:3
Beloved, while I was eager to write to you about our shared salvation, I felt it necessary to urge you to earnestly contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to the saints.

## Jude 1:4
For certain individuals have crept in unnoticed, those who were long ago marked for this condemnation, ungodly persons who pervert the grace of our God into indecent behaviour and deny our only Sovereign and Lord, Jesus Christ.

## Jude 1:5
Now I wish to remind you, though you know all things once for all, that the Lord, having saved a people out of the land of Egypt, later destroyed those who did not believe.

## Jude 1:6
And the angels who did not keep their own domain but abandoned their proper dwelling, He has kept in eternal chains under darkness for the judgement of the great day.

## Jude 1:7
Just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns indulged in sexual immorality and pursued strange flesh, they serve as an example by undergoing the punishment of eternal fire.

## Jude 1:8
In the same way, these people also, relying on their dreams, defile the flesh, reject authority, and speak abusively against celestial beings.

## Jude 1:9
But even Michael the archangel, when he disputed with the devil about the body of Moses, did not dare to pronounce a slanderous judgement against him, but said, “The Lord rebuke you!”

## Jude 1:10
Yet these people slander whatever they do not understand, and the things they do understand by instinct, like unreasoning animals, will destroy them.

## Jude 1:11
Woe to them! They have gone the way of Cain, and for profit have rushed into Balaam’s error, and perished in Korah’s rebellion.

## Jude 1:12
These are blemishes at your love feasts, feasting with you without fear, like shepherds who care only for themselves; clouds without water, carried along by winds; autumn trees without fruit, twice dead, uprooted.

## Jude 1:13
Wild waves of the sea, foaming up their shame; wandering stars, for whom the blackest darkness has been reserved forever.

## Jude 1:14
It was about these people that Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying, “Behold, the Lord comes with thousands upon thousands of His holy ones,

## Jude 1:15
to execute judgement on all, and to convict all the ungodly of all their ungodly deeds done in an ungodly way, and of all the harsh words ungodly sinners have spoken against Him.”

## Jude 1:16
These are grumblers, faultfinders, following their own evil desires; they boast about themselves and flatter others for their own advantage.

## Jude 1:17
But you, beloved, remember the words spoken beforehand by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ,

## Jude 1:18
that they told you, “In the last times there will be scoffers following their own ungodly desires.”

## Jude 1:19
These are the ones who create divisions, focused on worldly matters, lacking the Spirit.

## Jude 1:20
But you, beloved, by building yourselves up in your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit,

## Jude 1:21
keep yourselves in the love of God as you wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you to eternal life.

## Jude 1:22
And show compassion to those who are uncertain;

## Jude 1:23
save others by snatching them from the fire; to others show mercy, mixed with fear, hating even the clothing stained by corrupted flesh.

## Jude 1:24
Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless before His glorious presence with great joy—

## Jude 1:25
to the only God our Saviour, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority, before all time, now and forevermore! Amen.
