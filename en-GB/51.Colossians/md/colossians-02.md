## Colossians 2:1

For I want you to know how great a struggle I have on your behalf, and for those who are at Laodicea, and for all those who have not personally seen my face,

## Colossians 2:2

that their hearts may be encouraged, having been knit together in love, and attaining to all the wealth that comes from the full assurance of understanding, resulting in a true knowledge of God’s mystery—that is, Christ Himself,

## Colossians 2:3

in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.

## Colossians 2:4

I say this so that no one will deceive you with persuasive arguments.

## Colossians 2:5

For even though I am absent in body, I am nevertheless with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your orderly manner and the stability of your faith in Christ.

## Colossians 2:6

Therefore, as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him,

## Colossians 2:7

having been firmly rooted and now being built up in Him and established in your faith, just as you were instructed, and overflowing with gratitude.

## Colossians 2:8

See to it that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deception, according to human tradition, according to the elementary principles of the world, rather than according to Christ.

## Colossians 2:9

For in Him all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily form,

## Colossians 2:10

and in Him you have been made complete, and He is the head over every ruler and authority;

## Colossians 2:11

and in Him you were also circumcised with a circumcision performed without hands, in the removal of the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ,

## Colossians 2:12

having been buried with Him in baptism, in which you were also raised with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead.

## Colossians 2:13

And you, who were dead in your wrongdoings and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made alive together with Him, having forgiven us all our wrongdoings,

## Colossians 2:14

having cancelled the certificate of debt consisting of decrees against us, which was hostile to us; and He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross.

## Colossians 2:15

When He had disarmed the rulers and authorities, He made a public display of them, having triumphed over them through Him.

## Colossians 2:16

Therefore, no one is to act as your judge regarding food or drink, or in respect to a festival, or a new moon, or a Sabbath day—

## Colossians 2:17

things which are only a shadow of what is to come; but the substance belongs to Christ.

## Colossians 2:18

Take care that no one keeps defrauding you of your prize by delighting in humility and the worship of the angels, taking his stand on visions he has seen, inflated without cause by his fleshly mind,

## Colossians 2:19

and not holding firmly to the head, from whom the entire body, being supplied and held together by the joints and ligaments, grows with a growth which is from God.

## Colossians 2:20

If you have died with Christ to the elementary principles of the world, why, as if you were living in the world, do you submit yourself to regulations:

## Colossians 2:21

“Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch!”—

## Colossians 2:22

which all refer to things destined to perish with use—in accordance with the commandments and teachings of man?

## Colossians 2:23

These are matters which do have the appearance of wisdom in self-made religion and hum
