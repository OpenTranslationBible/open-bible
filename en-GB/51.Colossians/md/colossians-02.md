# Colossians Chapter 2

## Colossians 2:1

I want you to understand how great a struggle I have for you and for those at Laodicea, and for all who have not seen me face to face.

## Colossians 2:2

My aim is that their hearts may be encouraged, being united in love, and that they may reach all the wealth that comes from the full assurance of understanding, leading to a true knowledge of God's mystery, which is Christ Himself,

## Colossians 2:3

in whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are concealed.

## Colossians 2:4

I say this so that no one may deceive you with persuasive arguments.

## Colossians 2:5

For although I am absent in body, I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your orderly conduct and the firmness of your faith in Christ.

## Colossians 2:6

Therefore, as you have received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to walk in Him,

## Colossians 2:7

being rooted and built up in Him, and established in the faith as you were taught, overflowing with gratitude.

## Colossians 2:8

See to it that no one takes you captive through empty and deceptive philosophy, which is based on human tradition and the elemental spiritual forces of the world, rather than on Christ.

## Colossians 2:9

For in Him all the fullness of the divine nature lives in bodily form,

## Colossians 2:10

and in Him you have been made complete. He is the head over every ruler and authority.

## Colossians 2:11

In Him you were also circumcised with a circumcision not performed by human hands, by putting off the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ,

## Colossians 2:12

having been buried with Him in baptism, in which you were also raised with Him through faith in the powerful work of God, who raised Him from the dead.

## Colossians 2:13

And when you were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you alive together with Him, having forgiven us all our trespasses,

## Colossians 2:14

having cancelled the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. This He set aside, nailing it to the cross.

## Colossians 2:15

He disarmed the rulers and authorities and made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.

## Colossians 2:16

Therefore, let no one judge you in matters of food and drink, or with respect to a festival, a new moon, or a Sabbath day.

## Colossians 2:17

These are a shadow of future things, but the reality is found in Christ.

## Colossians 2:18

Let no one disqualify you, insisting on false humility and the worship of angels, dwelling on visions, puffed up without reason by their unspiritual mind,

## Colossians 2:19

and not holding fast to the head, from whom the whole body, nourished and held together by its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that is from God.

## Colossians 2:20

If you have died with Christ to the things of this world, why act as if you were still living in the world by submitting to its regulations?

## Colossians 2:21

“You must not handle, you must not taste, you must not touch!”?

## Colossians 2:22

These are concerning things destined to perish, and are based on human commands and teachings.

## Colossians 2:23

These indeed have an appearance of wisdom in self-imposed religion, false humility, and severe treatment of the body, but they are of no value in curbing sensual indulgence.
