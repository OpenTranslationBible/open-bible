# Colossians Chapter 1

## Colossians 1:1
Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,

## Colossians 1:2
To the holy and faithful brothers and sisters in Christ at Colossae: Grace and peace to you from God our Father.

## Colossians 1:3
We always give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you,

## Colossians 1:4
since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and the love you have for all the saints—

## Colossians 1:5
because of the hope reserved for you in heaven, which you have already heard about in the true message of the gospel

## Colossians 1:6
that has come to you. In the same way, the gospel is bearing fruit and growing throughout the whole world, just as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and truly understood God's grace.

## Colossians 1:7
You learned it from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of Christ on our behalf,

## Colossians 1:8
and who also informed us of your love in the Spirit.

## Colossians 1:9
For this reason, since the day we heard about you, we have not stopped praying for you and asking God to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all spiritual wisdom and understanding,

## Colossians 1:10
so that you may live a life worthy of the Lord and please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good work and growing in the knowledge of God;

## Colossians 1:11
being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience, joyously

## Colossians 1:12
giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the kingdom of light.

## Colossians 1:13
For he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son he loves,

## Colossians 1:14
in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.

## Colossians 1:15
The Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.

## Colossians 1:16
For in him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through him and for him.

## Colossians 1:17
He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.

## Colossians 1:18
And he is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead, so that in everything he might have the supremacy.

## Colossians 1:19
For it was the Father's good pleasure for all his fullness to dwell in him,

## Colossians 1:20
and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross.

## Colossians 1:21
Once you were alienated from God and hostile in your minds, engaged in evil deeds,

## Colossians 1:22
but now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation—

## Colossians 1:23
if you continue in your faith, established and firm, and do not move from the hope held out in the gospel. This is the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant.

## Colossians 1:24
Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I am filling up what is lacking in regard to Christ's afflictions, for the sake of his body, which is the church.

## Colossians 1:25
I have become its servant by the commission God gave me to present to you the word of God in its fullness—

## Colossians 1:26
the mystery that has been kept hidden for ages and generations, but is now disclosed to the Lord's people.

## Colossians 1:27
To them God has chosen to make known among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.

## Colossians 1:28
He is the one we proclaim, admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone fully mature in Christ.

## Colossians 1:29
To this end I labour, striving with all the energy Christ so powerfully works in me.
