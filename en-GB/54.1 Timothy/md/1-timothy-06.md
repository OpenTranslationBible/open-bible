# 1 Timothy Chapter 6

## 1 Timothy 6:1

All who are under the yoke as slaves are to regard their own masters as worthy of all honour so that the name of God and our teaching will not be spoken against.

## 1 Timothy 6:2

Those who have believers as their masters should not be disrespectful to them because they are brothers or sisters. Instead, they should serve them even better, since those who benefit from their service are believers and beloved. Teach and preach these principles.

## 1 Timothy 6:3

If anyone promotes a different doctrine and does not agree with sound words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and with the doctrine that aligns with godliness,

## 1 Timothy 6:4

he is conceited and understands nothing; but he has an unhealthy craving for controversial questions and disputes about words, from which come envy, strife, abusive language, evil suspicions,

## 1 Timothy 6:5

and constant friction between people of corrupt mind and deprived of the truth, who think that godliness is a means to gain.

## 1 Timothy 6:6

But godliness indeed is a source of great gain when accompanied by contentment.

## 1 Timothy 6:7

For we have brought nothing into the world, so we cannot take anything out of it.

## 1 Timothy 6:8

If we have food and clothing, with these we shall be content.

## 1 Timothy 6:9

But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and many foolish and harmful desires which plunge people into ruin and destruction.

## 1 Timothy 6:10

For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil, and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many sorrows.

## 1 Timothy 6:11

But avoid these things, you man of God, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance, and gentleness.

## 1 Timothy 6:12

Engage in the noble struggle of faith; embrace the eternal life to which you were called, and for which you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.

## 1 Timothy 6:13

I charge you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who made the good confession before Pontius Pilate,

## 1 Timothy 6:14

that you keep the commandment without blemish or blame until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,

## 1 Timothy 6:15

which He will reveal at the appointed time—He who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords,

## 1 Timothy 6:16

who alone possesses immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one has seen or can see. To Him be honour and eternal dominion! Amen.

## 1 Timothy 6:17

Instruct those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant or to set their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly provides us with all things to enjoy.

## 1 Timothy 6:18

Guide them to perform good deeds, to be abundant in good works, to be generous and willing to share,

## 1 Timothy 6:19

storing up for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of what is truly life.

## 1 Timothy 6:20

Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you, avoiding worldly, empty chatter and the opposing arguments of what is falsely called "knowledge"—

## 1 Timothy 6:21

which some have professed and thereby have gone astray from the faith.  
Grace be with you.
