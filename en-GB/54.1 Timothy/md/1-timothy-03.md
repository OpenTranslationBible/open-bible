# 1 Timothy Chapter 3

## 1 Timothy 3:1

This saying is trustworthy: if anyone aspires to the role of overseer, he desires a noble task.

## 1 Timothy 3:2

An overseer, then, must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach,

## 1 Timothy 3:3

not given to excessive drinking, not violent but gentle, not argumentative, free from the love of money.

## 1 Timothy 3:4

He must be one who manages his own household well, keeping his children respectful with all dignity

## 1 Timothy 3:5

(but if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of the church of God?);

## 1 Timothy 3:6

and not a recent convert, so that he will not become conceited and fall into the judgment brought by the devil.

## 1 Timothy 3:7

Moreover, he must have a good reputation with those outside the church, so that he will not fall into disgrace and the trap of the devil.

## 1 Timothy 3:8

Deacons likewise must be dignified, not insincere, not given to much wine, not greedy for dishonest gain,

## 1 Timothy 3:9

but adhering to the mystery of the faith with a sincere conscience.

## 1 Timothy 3:10

These individuals must also first be tested; then let them serve as deacons if they are found beyond reproach.

## 1 Timothy 3:11

Women must likewise be dignified, not slanderers, but temperate, faithful in all things.

## 1 Timothy 3:12

Deacons should be faithful to one wife, and effective managers of their children and their own households.

## 1 Timothy 3:13

For those who have served well as deacons gain for themselves a high standing and great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.

## 1 Timothy 3:14

I am writing these things to you, hoping to visit you soon;

## 1 Timothy 3:15

but in case I am delayed, I write so that you will know how one should conduct himself in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and support of the truth.

## 1 Timothy 3:16

Beyond question, great is the mystery of godliness:

> He who was revealed in the flesh,  
> Was vindicated in the Spirit,  
> Seen by angels,  
> Proclaimed among the nations,  
> Believed on in the world,  
> Taken up in glory.
