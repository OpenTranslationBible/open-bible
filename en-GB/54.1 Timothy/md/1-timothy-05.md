# 1 Timothy Chapter 5

## 1 Timothy 5:1

Do not harshly correct an older man, but rather encourage him as you would a father, and the younger men as brothers,

## 1 Timothy 5:2

the older women as mothers, and the younger women as sisters, with complete purity.

## 1 Timothy 5:3

Show respect to widows who are truly in need;

## 1 Timothy 5:4

but if any widow has children or grandchildren, they must learn to show proper respect for their own household and to make some return to their parents; for this is acceptable in the sight of God.

## 1 Timothy 5:5

Now she who is truly a widow and has been left alone has set her hope on God, and she continues in requests and prayers night and day.

## 1 Timothy 5:6

But the one who lives in self-indulgence is as good as dead, even while she lives.

## 1 Timothy 5:7

Provide these instructions as well, so that they may be above reproach.

## 1 Timothy 5:8

However, if anyone fails to care for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than one without belief.

## 1 Timothy 5:9

A widow should be put on the list only if she is at least sixty years old and has been the wife of one man,

## 1 Timothy 5:10

having a reputation for good works: if she has brought up children, if she has shown hospitality to strangers, if she has washed the saints’ feet, if she has assisted those in distress, and if she has devoted herself to every good work.

## 1 Timothy 5:11

But refuse to enrol younger widows, for when they feel physical desires alienating them from Christ, they want to get married,

## 1 Timothy 5:12

incurring condemnation, because they have set aside their previous pledge.

## 1 Timothy 5:13

At the same time they also learn to be idle, going around from house to house; and not merely idle, but also gossips and busybodies, talking about things not proper to mention.

## 1 Timothy 5:14

Therefore, I desire younger widows to marry, have children, manage their households, and give the enemy no opportunity for reproach;

## 1 Timothy 5:15

for some have already strayed and now follow Satan.

## 1 Timothy 5:16

If any woman who is a believer has dependent widows, she must assist them and the church must not be burdened, so that it may assist those who are truly widows.

## 1 Timothy 5:17

The elders who lead well are to be considered worthy of double honour, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching.

## 1 Timothy 5:18

For the Scripture says, “You shall not muzzle the ox while it is threshing,” and “The labourer is worthy of his wages.”

## 1 Timothy 5:19

Do not entertain an accusation against an elder unless it is confirmed by two or three witnesses.

## 1 Timothy 5:20

Those who continue in sin, rebuke in the presence of all, so that the rest also will be fearful.

## 1 Timothy 5:21

I earnestly urge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of His chosen angels, to uphold these principles without bias, doing nothing in a spirit of partiality.

## 1 Timothy 5:22

Do not hastily lay hands upon anyone and thereby share in the sins of others; keep yourself free from sin.

## 1 Timothy 5:23

Do not limit yourself to drinking only water, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments.

## 1 Timothy 5:24

The sins of some people are quite evident, preceding them to judgment; for others, their sins follow after.

## 1 Timothy 5:25

In the same way, deeds that are good are quite evident, and those which are otherwise cannot be concealed.
