# 1 Timothy Chapter 2

## 1 Timothy 2:1

To begin with, I encourage that requests, prayers, intercession, and thanksgiving be offered for everyone,

## 1 Timothy 2:2

including kings and all those in positions of authority, so that we may live a peaceful and quiet life in all godliness and dignity.

## 1 Timothy 2:3

This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour,

## 1 Timothy 2:4

who wishes for all people to be saved and to come to understand the truth.

## 1 Timothy 2:5

For there is one God, and one mediator between God and humanity, the man Christ Jesus,

## 1 Timothy 2:6

who offered Himself as a ransom for all, the testimony given at the appropriate time.

## 1 Timothy 2:7

For this purpose, I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I speak the truth, I am not lying), as a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.

## 1 Timothy 2:8

Therefore, I desire that the men in every place pray, lifting up holy hands, without anger and argument.

## 1 Timothy 2:9

Similarly, I want women to dress themselves in suitable clothing, modestly and discreetly, not with braided hair, gold, pearls, or costly attire,

## 1 Timothy 2:10

but rather through good deeds, as is fitting for women who profess godliness.

## 1 Timothy 2:11

A woman should learn quietly and with full respect.

## 1 Timothy 2:12

But I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be quiet.

## 1 Timothy 2:13

For Adam was formed first, and then Eve.

## 1 Timothy 2:14

And it was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.

## 1 Timothy 2:15

Yet women will be kept safe through childbearingâ€”if they continue in faith, love, and holiness, with self-control.
