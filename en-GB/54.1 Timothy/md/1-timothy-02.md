# 1 Timothy Chapter 2

## 1 Timothy 2:1

First of all, then, I urge that requests, prayers, intercession, and thanksgiving be made in behalf of all people,

## 1 Timothy 2:2

for kings and all who are in authority, so that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity.

## 1 Timothy 2:3

This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour,

## 1 Timothy 2:4

who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.

## 1 Timothy 2:5

For there is one God, and one mediator also between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus,

## 1 Timothy 2:6

who gave Himself as a ransom for all, the testimony given at the proper time.

## 1 Timothy 2:7

For this I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I am telling the truth, I am not lying), as a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.

## 1 Timothy 2:8

Therefore I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands, without anger and dispute.

## 1 Timothy 2:9

Likewise, I want women to adorn themselves with proper clothing, modestly and discreetly, not with braided hair, gold, pearls, or expensive apparel,

## 1 Timothy 2:10

but rather by means of good works, as is proper for women making a claim to godliness.

## 1 Timothy 2:11

A woman must quietly receive instruction with entire submissiveness.

## 1 Timothy 2:12

But I do not allow a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man, but to remain quiet.

## 1 Timothy 2:13

For it was Adam who was first created, and then Eve.

## 1 Timothy 2:14

And it was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a wrongdoer.

## 1 Timothy 2:15

But women will be preserved through childbirthâ€”if they continue in faith, love, and sanctity, with moderation.
