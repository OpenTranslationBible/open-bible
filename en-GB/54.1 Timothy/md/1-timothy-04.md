# 1 Timothy Chapter 4

## 1 Timothy 4:1

Yet the Spirit clearly indicates that in later times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to misleading spirits and doctrines of evil,

## 1 Timothy 4:2

through the insincerity of those who speak falsehoods, their consciences being as if branded with a hot iron,

## 1 Timothy 4:3

who prohibit marriage and advocate abstaining from foods which God has created to be received with gratitude by those who believe and know the truth.

## 1 Timothy 4:4

For everything God has created is good, and nothing is to be refused if it is received with thankfulness;

## 1 Timothy 4:5

for it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer.

## 1 Timothy 4:6

By reminding the brothers and sisters of these things, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, continually nourished by the words of faith and the sound teaching which you have been following.

## 1 Timothy 4:7

But avoid pointless tales typical of old women, and train yourself for the purpose of godliness;

## 1 Timothy 4:8

for physical training has some value, but godliness is valuable in every way, as it holds promise for both the present life and the life to come.

## 1 Timothy 4:9

This is a statement worthy of full acceptance.

## 1 Timothy 4:10

For it is for this we labour and strive, because we have set our hope on the living God, who is the Saviour of all people, especially of those who believe.

## 1 Timothy 4:11

Command and teach these things.

## 1 Timothy 4:12

Let no one look down on your youth, but be an example for those who believe, in speech, conduct, love, faith, and purity.

## 1 Timothy 4:13

Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading, to exhortation, and to teaching.

## 1 Timothy 4:14

Do not neglect the spiritual gift within you, which was given to you through prophecy with the laying on of hands by the council of elders.

## 1 Timothy 4:15

Be diligent in these matters; immerse yourself in them, so that your progress may be evident to all.

## 1 Timothy 4:16

Watch your life and doctrine closely; persevere in them, for by doing so you will ensure salvation both for yourself and for those who listen to you.
