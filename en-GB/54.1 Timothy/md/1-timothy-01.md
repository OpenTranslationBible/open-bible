# 1 Timothy Chapter 1

## 1 Timothy 1:1

Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Saviour, and of Christ Jesus, who is our hope,

## 1 Timothy 1:2

To Timothy, my true son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

## 1 Timothy 1:3

Just as I urged you upon my departure for Macedonia, remain on at Ephesus so that you may instruct certain people not to teach strange doctrines,

## 1 Timothy 1:4

nor to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which give rise to useless speculation rather than advancing Godâ€™s plan, which is by faith.

## 1 Timothy 1:5

The aim of our instruction is love that comes from a pure heart, a good conscience, and a sincere faith.

## 1 Timothy 1:6

Some individuals have deviated from these principles and have turned to meaningless discussions,

## 1 Timothy 1:7

desiring to be teachers of the Law, though they do not comprehend what they are saying or the subjects about which they make confident claims.

## 1 Timothy 1:8

But we know that the Law is good, if one uses it lawfully,

## 1 Timothy 1:9

realising the fact that law is not made for a righteous person, but for those who are lawless and rebellious, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers,

## 1 Timothy 1:10

for those who engage in immoral acts, those who exploit others, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound teaching,

## 1 Timothy 1:11

in line with the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which has been entrusted to me.

## 1 Timothy 1:12

I am grateful to Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me strength, because He considered me faithful, appointing me to His service,

## 1 Timothy 1:13

even though I was previously a blasphemer, a persecutor, and a violent aggressor. Yet I was shown mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief;

## 1 Timothy 1:14

and the grace of our Lord was exceedingly abundant, with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.

## 1 Timothy 1:15

It is a trustworthy statement, deserving full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost.

## 1 Timothy 1:16

Yet for this reason I was shown mercy, so that in me, the foremost sinner, Jesus Christ might display His perfect patience as an example for those who would believe in Him for eternal life.

## 1 Timothy 1:17

Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honour and glory forever and ever. Amen.

## 1 Timothy 1:18

This command I entrust to you, Timothy, my son, in accordance with the prophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you may fight the good fight,

## 1 Timothy 1:19

maintaining faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected and thus have suffered shipwreck in regard to their faith.

## 1 Timothy 1:20

Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan, so that they may learn not to blaspheme.
