# 1 Chronicles Chapter 21

## 1 Chronicles 21:1

Satan rose against Israel

> and prompted David to count the people of Israel.

---

## 1 Chronicles 21:2

So David said to Joab and to the leaders of the people,

> “Go, count Israel from Beersheba to Dan,  
> and bring me a report, so that I may know their number.”

---

## 1 Chronicles 21:3

But Joab said,

> “May the Lord add to His people a hundred times as many as they are!  
> But, my lord the king, are they not all my lord’s servants?  
> Why does my lord seek this thing?  
> Why should he bring guilt upon Israel?”

---

## 1 Chronicles 21:4

Nevertheless, the king’s word prevailed against Joab.  
So Joab departed and went throughout all Israel,

> and came to Jerusalem.

---

## 1 Chronicles 21:5

Joab gave the number of the census of all the people to David.

> And all Israel was 1,100,000 men who drew the sword,  
> and Judah was 470,000 men who drew the sword.

---

## 1 Chronicles 21:6

But he did not count Levi and Benjamin among them,

> because the king’s command was detestable to Joab.

---

## 1 Chronicles 21:7

God was displeased with this action,

> so He brought trouble upon Israel.

---

## 1 Chronicles 21:8

Then David said to God,

> “I have sinned greatly by doing this thing.  
> But now, please forgive Your servant’s guilt,  
> for I have acted very foolishly.”

---

## 1 Chronicles 21:9

The Lord then gave a message to Gad, David’s seer,

---

## 1 Chronicles 21:10

> “Go and speak to David, saying,  
> ‘This is what the Lord says:  
> I am offering you three things;  
> choose for yourself one of them, which I will do to you.’”

---

## 1 Chronicles 21:11

So Gad came to David and said to him,

> “This is what the Lord says:

---

## 1 Chronicles 21:12

> ‘Choose for yourself:  
> either three years of famine,  
> or three months to be swept away before your foes,  
> while the sword of your enemies overtakes you,  
> or three days of the sword of the Lord,  
> a plague in the land,  
> and the angel of the Lord destroying throughout the territory of Israel.’  
> Now decide what answer I shall bring back to Him who sent me.”

---

## 1 Chronicles 21:13

David said to Gad,

> “I am in great distress;  
> let me fall into the hands of the Lord,  
> for His mercies are very great.  
> But do not let me fall into human hands.”

---

## 1 Chronicles 21:14

So the Lord sent a plague on Israel,

> and seventy thousand men of Israel fell.

---

## 1 Chronicles 21:15

And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it;  
but as he was about to destroy it,  
the Lord saw and relented of the disaster,

> and said to the destroying angel,  
> “It is enough; now relax your hand.”  
> And the angel of the Lord was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.

---

## 1 Chronicles 21:16

Then David raised his eyes and saw the angel of the Lord standing between earth and heaven,

> with his drawn sword in his hand, stretched out over Jerusalem.  
> And David and the elders, covered with sackcloth, fell on their faces.

---

## 1 Chronicles 21:17

David said to God,

> “Was it not I who commanded to count the people?  
> Indeed, I am the one who has sinned and done very wickedly,  
> but these sheep, what have they done?  
> Lord my God, please let Your hand be against me and my father’s household,  
> but not against Your people, so that there will not be a plague among them.”

---

## 1 Chronicles 21:18

Then the angel of the Lord instructed Gad to tell David

> that he should go up and build an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.

---

## 1 Chronicles 21:19

So David went up at Gad's instruction,

> which he spoke in the name of the Lord.

---

## 1 Chronicles 21:20

Ornan turned back and saw the angel,  
and his four sons who were with him hid themselves.

> Ornan was threshing wheat.

---

## 1 Chronicles 21:21

As David approached Ornan,

> Ornan looked and saw David,  
> and went out from the threshing floor,  
> and bowed down to David with his face to the ground.

---

## 1 Chronicles 21:22

Then David said to Ornan,

> “Give me the site of the threshing floor,  
> so that I may build an altar to the Lord on it;  
> give it to me for the full price,  
> so that the plague may be brought to a halt from the people.”

---

## 1 Chronicles 21:23

But Ornan said to David,

> “Take it for yourself;  
> and may my lord the king do what is good in his sight.  
> See, I will give the oxen for the burnt offerings,  
> the threshing sledges for the wood,  
> and the wheat for the grain offering; I will give it all.”

---

## 1 Chronicles 21:24

However, King David said to Ornan,

> “No, but I will certainly buy it for the full price;  
> for I will not take what is yours for the Lord,  
> nor offer a burnt offering that costs me nothing.”

---

## 1 Chronicles 21:25

So David paid Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight to buy the site.

---

## 1 Chronicles 21:26

Then David built an altar to the Lord there,

> and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.  
> He called to the Lord, and He answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering.

---

## 1 Chronicles 21:27

Then the Lord commanded the angel,

> and he put his sword back in its sheath.

---

## 1 Chronicles 21:28

When David realised that the Lord had responded to him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite,

> he offered sacrifice there.

---

## 1 Chronicles 21:29

At that time, the tabernacle of the Lord, constructed by Moses in the wilderness, along with the altar of burnt offering, was located on the high place at Gibeon.

---

## 1 Chronicles 21:30

But David was unable to go before it to inquire of God,

> because he was afraid of the sword of the angel of the Lord.
