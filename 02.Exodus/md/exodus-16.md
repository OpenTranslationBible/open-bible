# Exodus Chapter 16

## Exodus 16:1
The entire Israelite community set out from Elim and came to the Desert of Sin, which lies between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after leaving Egypt.

## Exodus 16:2
There in the desert the whole community grumbled against Moses and Aaron.

## Exodus 16:3
The Israelites said, “If only we had died by the Lord’s hand in Egypt! There we sat around pots of meat and ate all the food we wanted, but you have brought us into this desert to starve this whole assembly to death.”

## Exodus 16:4
Then the Lord said to Moses, “I will rain down bread from heaven for you. The people are to go out each day and gather enough for that day. In this way I will test them to see whether they follow My instructions.

## Exodus 16:5
On the sixth day they are to prepare what they bring in, and it will be twice as much as they gather on the other days.”

## Exodus 16:6
So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites, “In the evening you will know it was the Lord who brought you out of Egypt,

## Exodus 16:7
and in the morning you will see the glory of the Lord, because He has heard your grumbling against Him. Who are we, that you complain against us?”

## Exodus 16:8
Moses also said, “You will know it is the Lord when He gives you meat in the evening and all the bread you want in the morning, because He has heard your grumbling. You are not grumbling against us, but against the Lord.”

## Exodus 16:9
Then Moses told Aaron, “Say to the entire community: Come before the Lord, for He has heard your complaints.”

## Exodus 16:10
As Aaron spoke to the assembly, they looked toward the desert, and the glory of the Lord appeared in the cloud.

## Exodus 16:11
The Lord said to Moses,

## Exodus 16:12
“I have heard the grumbling of the Israelites. Tell them: At twilight you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be filled with bread. Then you will know that I am the Lord your God.”

## Exodus 16:13
That evening quail came and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp.

## Exodus 16:14
When the dew was gone, thin flakes like frost appeared on the desert floor.

## Exodus 16:15
When the Israelites saw it, they asked each other, “What is it?” because they did not know what it was. Moses said, “It is the bread the Lord has given you to eat.

## Exodus 16:16
This is what the Lord has commanded: Everyone is to gather as much as they need. Take an omer for each person in your tent.”

## Exodus 16:17
The Israelites did as they were told; some gathered more, some less.

## Exodus 16:18
But when they measured it by the omer, the one who gathered much had nothing left over, and the one who gathered little did not lack. Everyone had gathered just what they needed.

## Exodus 16:19
Then Moses said to them, “No one is to keep any of it until morning.”

## Exodus 16:20
But some ignored Moses and kept part of it until morning. It became full of maggots and began to smell. So Moses was angry with them.

## Exodus 16:21
Each morning they gathered as much as they needed, and when the sun grew hot, it melted away.

## Exodus 16:22
On the sixth day they gathered twice as much—two omers for each person—and the leaders of the community came and reported this to Moses.

## Exodus 16:23
He said to them, “This is what the Lord commanded: Tomorrow is a day of rest, a holy Sabbath to the Lord. Bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil. Whatever is left, keep it until morning.”

## Exodus 16:24
So they saved it until morning, as Moses commanded, and it did not stink or get maggots in it.

## Exodus 16:25
“Eat it today,” Moses said, “because today is a Sabbath to the Lord. You will not find any manna on the ground today.

## Exodus 16:26
You are to gather it for six days, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will not be any.”

## Exodus 16:27
Nevertheless, some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather it, but they found nothing.

## Exodus 16:28
Then the Lord said to Moses, “How long will you refuse to keep My commands and instructions?

## Exodus 16:29
Bear in mind that the Lord has given you the Sabbath; that is why He gives you bread for two days on the sixth day. Everyone is to stay where they are on the seventh day.

## Exodus 16:30
So the people rested on the seventh day.

## Exodus 16:31
The people of Israel called the bread manna. It was white like coriander seed and tasted like wafers made with honey.

## Exodus 16:32
Moses said, “This is what the Lord has commanded: Keep an omer of manna for the generations to come, so they may see the bread I gave you in the wilderness when I brought you out of Egypt.”

## Exodus 16:33
So Moses said to Aaron, “Take a jar and put an omer of manna in it. Then place it before the Lord to be kept for the generations to come.”

## Exodus 16:34
As the Lord commanded Moses, Aaron put it with the tablets of the covenant law, so that it might be preserved.

## Exodus 16:35
The Israelites ate manna forty years, until they came to a land that was settled; they ate manna until they reached the border of Canaan.

## Exodus 16:36
(An omer is one-tenth of an ephah.)
