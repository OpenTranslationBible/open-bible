# Exodus Chapter 8

## Exodus 8:1
Then the Lord said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘This is what the Lord says: Let My people go, so they may worship Me.

## Exodus 8:2
If you refuse to let them go, I will send a plague of frogs on your entire land.

## Exodus 8:3
The Nile will teem with frogs. They will come up into your palace, your bedroom, and onto your bed, into the houses of your officials and your people, and into your ovens and kneading bowls.

## Exodus 8:4
The frogs will come up on you, your people, and all your officials.’”

## Exodus 8:5
Then the Lord said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Stretch out your hand with your staff over the streams and canals and ponds, and make frogs come up on the land of Egypt.’”

## Exodus 8:6
So Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land.

## Exodus 8:7
But the magicians did the same things by their secret arts; they also made frogs come up on the land of Egypt.

## Exodus 8:8
Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Pray to the Lord to take the frogs away from me and my people, and I will let your people go to offer sacrifices to the Lord.”

## Exodus 8:9
Moses said to Pharaoh, “I leave to you the honour of setting the time for me to pray for you and your officials and your people, so that you and your houses may be rid of the frogs, except those in the Nile.”

## Exodus 8:10
“Tomorrow,” Pharaoh said. Moses replied, “It will be as you say, so that you may know there is no one like the Lord our God.

## Exodus 8:11
The frogs will leave you and your houses, your officials and your people; they will remain only in the Nile.”

## Exodus 8:12
After Moses and Aaron left Pharaoh, Moses cried out to the Lord about the frogs He had brought on Pharaoh.

## Exodus 8:13
And the Lord did what Moses asked. The frogs died in the houses, in the courtyards, and in the fields.

## Exodus 8:14
They were piled into heaps, and the land reeked of them.

## Exodus 8:15
But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and would not listen to them, just as the Lord had said.

## Exodus 8:16
Then the Lord said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the ground,’ and throughout the land of Egypt the dust will become gnats.”

## Exodus 8:17
They did this, and when Aaron stretched out his hand with the staff and struck the dust, gnats came on people and animals. All the dust throughout Egypt became gnats.

## Exodus 8:18
But when the magicians tried to produce gnats by their secret arts, they could not. Since the gnats were on people and animals everywhere,

## Exodus 8:19
the magicians said to Pharaoh, “This is the finger of God.” But Pharaoh’s heart was hard and he would not listen, just as the Lord had said.

## Exodus 8:20
Then the Lord said to Moses, “Get up early in the morning and confront Pharaoh as he goes to the water, and say to him, ‘This is what the Lord says: Let My people go, so that they may worship Me.

## Exodus 8:21
If you do not let My people go, I will send swarms of flies on you and your officials, on your people and into your houses. The houses of the Egyptians will be full of flies, and even the ground will be covered with them.

## Exodus 8:22
But on that day I will deal differently with the land of Goshen, where My people live; no swarms of flies will be there, so that you will know I, the Lord, am in this land.

## Exodus 8:23
I will make a distinction between My people and your people. This sign will take place tomorrow.’”

## Exodus 8:24
And the Lord did so. Dense swarms of flies poured into Pharaoh’s palace and into the houses of his officials; throughout Egypt the land was ruined by the flies.

## Exodus 8:25
Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Go, sacrifice to your God here in the land.”

## Exodus 8:26
But Moses said, “That would not be right. The sacrifices we offer the Lord our God would be detestable to the Egyptians. If we offer sacrifices that offend them, won’t they stone us?

## Exodus 8:27
We must take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the Lord our God, as He commands us.”

## Exodus 8:28
Pharaoh said, “I will let you go to offer sacrifices to the Lord your God in the wilderness, but you must not go very far. Now pray for me.”

## Exodus 8:29
Moses answered, “As soon as I leave you, I will pray to the Lord, and tomorrow the flies will leave Pharaoh, his officials, and his people. But let Pharaoh not act deceitfully again by refusing to let the people go to offer sacrifices.”

## Exodus 8:30
Then Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the Lord,

## Exodus 8:31
and the Lord did what Moses asked. The flies left Pharaoh and his officials and his people; not one remained.

## Exodus 8:32
But Pharaoh hardened his heart again and would not let the people go.
