# Exodus Chapter 1

## Exodus 1:1
These are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob, each with his household:

## Exodus 1:2
Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah;

## Exodus 1:3
Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin;

## Exodus 1:4
Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.

## Exodus 1:5
The total number of Jacob’s descendants was seventy. Joseph was already in Egypt.

## Exodus 1:6
Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died.

## Exodus 1:7
But the Israelites were fruitful and increased greatly; they multiplied and became exceedingly numerous, so that the land was filled with them.

## Exodus 1:8
Then a new king, who did not know about Joseph, came to power in Egypt.

## Exodus 1:9
He said to his people, “Look, the Israelites have become too numerous and too powerful for us.

## Exodus 1:10
Come, let us deal shrewdly with them, or they will continue to multiply. If war breaks out, they may join our enemies, fight against us, and leave the country.”

## Exodus 1:11
So they appointed taskmasters over the Israelites to oppress them with forced labour. They built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh.

## Exodus 1:12
But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites.

## Exodus 1:13
They made their lives bitter with harsh labour in brick and mortar and all kinds of work in the fields.

## Exodus 1:14
In all their labour, the Egyptians used them ruthlessly.

## Exodus 1:15
Then the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah,

## Exodus 1:16
“When you help the Hebrew women in childbirth and observe them on the delivery stool, if it is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, let her live.”

## Exodus 1:17
However, the midwives feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them; they let the boys live.

## Exodus 1:18
Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, “Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?”

## Exodus 1:19
The midwives answered Pharaoh, “Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive.”

## Exodus 1:20
So God was kind to the midwives, and the people increased and became even more numerous.

## Exodus 1:21
And because the midwives feared God, He gave them families of their own.

## Exodus 1:22
Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people: “Every Hebrew boy that is born you must throw into the Nile, but let every girl live.”
