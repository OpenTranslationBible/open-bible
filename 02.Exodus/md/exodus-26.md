# Exodus Chapter 26

## Exodus 26:1
“Make the tabernacle with ten curtains of finely twisted linen and blue, purple and scarlet yarn, with cherubim woven into them by a skilled worker.

## Exodus 26:2
All the curtains shall be the same size—twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide.

## Exodus 26:3
Join five of the curtains together, and do the same with the other five.

## Exodus 26:4
Make loops of blue material along the edge of the end curtain in one set, and do the same on the end curtain in the other set.

## Exodus 26:5
Make fifty loops on one curtain and fifty on the edge of the other, so the loops are opposite each other.

## Exodus 26:6
Then make fifty gold clasps and use them to fasten the curtains together so that the tabernacle is a single unit.

## Exodus 26:7
“Make curtains of goat hair for a tent over the tabernacle—eleven altogether.

## Exodus 26:8
All eleven curtains are to be the same size—thirty cubits long and four cubits wide.

## Exodus 26:9
Join five of the curtains into one set and the other six into another set. Fold the sixth curtain double at the front of the tent.

## Exodus 26:10
Make fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in one set, and fifty along the edge of the curtain in the other set.

## Exodus 26:11
Then make fifty bronze clasps and put them in the loops to join the tent together as a unit.

## Exodus 26:12
The extra half curtain that is left over should hang down at the rear of the tabernacle.

## Exodus 26:13
The tent curtains will be longer than the tabernacle—half a cubit on each side—so that it hangs over the sides of the tabernacle and covers it.

## Exodus 26:14
Make for the tent a covering of ram skins dyed red, and over that a covering of durable leather.

## Exodus 26:15
“Make upright frames of acacia wood for the tabernacle.

## Exodus 26:16
Each frame is to be ten cubits long and one and a half cubits wide,

## Exodus 26:17
with two projections set parallel to each other. Make all the frames of the tabernacle in this way.

## Exodus 26:18
Make twenty frames for the south side of the tabernacle

## Exodus 26:19
and make forty silver bases to go under them—two bases for each frame, one under each projection.

## Exodus 26:20
For the north side of the tabernacle make twenty frames

## Exodus 26:21
and forty silver bases—two under each frame.

## Exodus 26:22
Make six frames for the far end, that is, the west end of the tabernacle,

## Exodus 26:23
and make two frames for the corners at the far end.

## Exodus 26:24
These corner frames are to be connected at the bottom and at the top by a single ring. Form both corner frames in this way.

## Exodus 26:25
So there will be eight frames and sixteen silver bases—two under each frame.

## Exodus 26:26
“Also make crossbars of acacia wood: five for the frames on one side of the tabernacle,

## Exodus 26:27
five for those on the other side, and five for the frames on the west, at the far end of the tabernacle.

## Exodus 26:28
The central crossbar is to extend from end to end at the middle of the frames.

## Exodus 26:29
Overlay the frames with gold and make gold rings to hold the crossbars. Also overlay the crossbars with gold.

## Exodus 26:30
Set up the tabernacle according to the plan shown you on the mountain.

## Exodus 26:31
“Make a curtain of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen, with cherubim woven into it by a skilled craftsman.

## Exodus 26:32
Hang it with gold hooks on four posts of acacia wood overlaid with gold and standing on four silver bases.

## Exodus 26:33
Hang the curtain from the clasps and place the ark of the covenant law behind the curtain. The curtain will separate the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place.

## Exodus 26:34
Put the atonement cover on the ark of the covenant law in the Most Holy Place.

## Exodus 26:35
Place the table outside the curtain on the north side of the tabernacle and put the lampstand opposite it on the south side.

## Exodus 26:36
“Make a curtain for the entrance to the tent, of blue, purple and scarlet yarn and finely twisted linen—the work of an embroiderer.

## Exodus 26:37
Make five posts of acacia wood for the curtain and overlay them with gold. Make gold hooks for them and cast five bronze bases for them.
