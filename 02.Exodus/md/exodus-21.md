# Exodus Chapter 21

## Exodus 21:1
These are the laws you are to set before the Israelites:

## Exodus 21:2
If you buy a Hebrew servant, he is to serve you for six years. But in the seventh year, he shall go free, without paying anything.

## Exodus 21:3
If he came alone, he is to go free alone; but if he had a wife when he came, she is to go with him.

## Exodus 21:4
If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall belong to the master, and only the man shall go free.

## Exodus 21:5
But if the servant declares, ‘I love my master and my wife and children and do not want to go free,’

## Exodus 21:6
then his master must take him before the judges. He shall take him to the door or doorpost and pierce his ear with an awl. Then he will be his servant for life.

## Exodus 21:7
If a man sells his daughter as a servant, she is not to go free as male servants do.

## Exodus 21:8
If she does not please the master who has chosen her for himself, he must allow her to be redeemed. He has no right to sell her to foreigners, since he has broken faith with her.

## Exodus 21:9
If he selects her for his son, he must grant her the rights of a daughter.

## Exodus 21:10
If he marries another woman, he must not deprive the first one of her food, clothing and marital rights.

## Exodus 21:11
If he does not provide her with these three things, she is to go free, without paying anything.

## Exodus 21:12
Anyone who strikes a person and kills them is to be put to death.

## Exodus 21:13
However, if it was not intentional but an act of God, I will designate a place to which the killer may flee.

## Exodus 21:14
But if someone schemes and kills another person deliberately, you are to take that person even from My altar and put them to death.

## Exodus 21:15
Anyone who attacks their father or mother is to be put to death.

## Exodus 21:16
Anyone who kidnaps someone is to be put to death, whether the victim has been sold or is still in the kidnapper’s possession.

## Exodus 21:17
Anyone who curses their father or mother is to be put to death.

## Exodus 21:18
If people quarrel and one person hits another with a stone or with their fist and the victim does not die but is confined to bed,

## Exodus 21:19
the one who struck the blow will not be held liable if the other can get up and walk around with a staff. However, they must pay for the loss of time and see that the victim is completely healed.

## Exodus 21:20
If a man beats his male or female servant with a rod and the servant dies as a direct result, he must be punished.

## Exodus 21:21
But if the servant recovers after a day or two, the man is not to be punished, since the servant is his property.

## Exodus 21:22
If people are fighting and hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely but there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman’s husband demands and the court allows.

## Exodus 21:23
But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life,

## Exodus 21:24
eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,

## Exodus 21:25
burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.

## Exodus 21:26
If a man hits a servant in the eye and destroys it, he must let the servant go free to compensate for the eye.

## Exodus 21:27
And if he knocks out the tooth of a servant, he must let the servant go free to compensate for the tooth.

## Exodus 21:28
If a bull gores a man or a woman to death, the bull must be stoned to death, and its meat must not be eaten. But the owner will not be held responsible.

## Exodus 21:29
However, if the bull was known to be aggressive and the owner had been warned but did not keep it restrained and it kills someone, the bull must be stoned and the owner also must be put to death.

## Exodus 21:30
If payment is demanded, the owner may redeem their life by paying whatever is demanded.

## Exodus 21:31
This law also applies if the bull gores a son or daughter.

## Exodus 21:32
If the bull gores a male or female servant, the owner must pay thirty shekels of silver to the servant’s master, and the bull is to be stoned.

## Exodus 21:33
If someone uncovers or digs a pit and fails to cover it and an animal falls in,

## Exodus 21:34
the one who opened the pit must pay for the loss and take possession of the dead animal.

## Exodus 21:35
If one person’s bull injures another’s so that it dies, they are to sell the live one and divide both the money and the dead animal.

## Exodus 21:36
But if it was known that the bull had a habit of goring, yet the owner did not keep it under control, the owner must pay animal for animal, and the dead animal shall become theirs.
