# Exodus Chapter 9

## Exodus 9:1

Then the Lord said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘This is what the Lord, the God of the Hebrews, says: Let My people go, so that they may worship Me.

## Exodus 9:2

If you refuse to let them go and continue to hold them back,

## Exodus 9:3

the hand of the Lord will bring a severe plague on your livestock in the field—on your horses, donkeys, camels, cattle, sheep and goats.

## Exodus 9:4

But the Lord will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and Egypt, so that no animal belonging to the Israelites will die.”

## Exodus 9:5

The Lord set a time and said, “Tomorrow the Lord will do this in the land.”

## Exodus 9:6

And the next day the Lord did it. All the livestock of the Egyptians died, but not one animal belonging to the Israelites died.

## Exodus 9:7

Pharaoh sent men to investigate and found that not even one of the animals of the Israelites had died. Yet his heart was unyielding.

## Exodus 9:8

Then the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, “Take handfuls of soot from a furnace and have Moses toss it into the air in the presence of Pharaoh.

## Exodus 9:9

It will become fine dust over all the land of Egypt, and festering boils will break out on people and animals.”

## Exodus 9:10

So they took soot, and Moses tossed it into the air. It caused boils to break out on people and animals.

## Exodus 9:11

The magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils. The Lord had afflicted them just like the rest.

## Exodus 9:12

But the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not listen to Moses and Aaron.
