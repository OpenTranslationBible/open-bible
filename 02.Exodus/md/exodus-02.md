# Exodus Chapter 2

## Exodus 2:1
Now a man of the house of Levi married a Levite woman,

## Exodus 2:2
and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. When she saw that he was a fine child, she hid him for three months.

## Exodus 2:3
But when she could no longer hide him, she got a basket made of papyrus, coated it with tar and pitch, placed the child in it, and set it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile.

## Exodus 2:4
His sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.

## Exodus 2:5
Then Pharaoh’s daughter went down to the Nile to bathe, and her attendants walked along the riverbank. She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her servant to retrieve it.

## Exodus 2:6
She opened it and saw the baby. He was crying, and she felt compassion for him. “This must be one of the Hebrew babies,” she said.

## Exodus 2:7
Then the baby’s sister asked Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and call a Hebrew woman to nurse the baby for you?”

## Exodus 2:8
“Yes, go,” she answered. And the girl went and called the baby’s mother.

## Exodus 2:9
Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay you.” So the woman took the child and nursed him.

## Exodus 2:10
When the child grew older, she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses, saying, “I drew him out of the water.”

## Exodus 2:11
One day, after Moses had grown up, he went out to where his own people were and saw their hard labour. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his own people.

## Exodus 2:12
Looking around and seeing no one, he struck down the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.

## Exodus 2:13
The next day he went out and saw two Hebrews fighting. He asked the one in the wrong, “Why are you hitting your fellow Hebrew?”

## Exodus 2:14
The man replied, “Who made you ruler and judge over us? Are you thinking of killing me as you killed the Egyptian?” Then Moses was afraid and thought, “What I did must have become known.”

## Exodus 2:15
When Pharaoh heard of this, he tried to kill Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in Midian, where he sat down by a well.

## Exodus 2:16
Now a priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came to draw water and fill the troughs for their father’s flock.

## Exodus 2:17
Some shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses got up and came to their rescue and watered their flock.

## Exodus 2:18
When the girls returned to Reuel their father, he asked them, “Why have you returned so early today?”

## Exodus 2:19
They answered, “An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds. He even drew water for us and watered the flock.”

## Exodus 2:20
“And where is he?” he asked his daughters. “Why did you leave the man? Invite him to eat with us.”

## Exodus 2:21
Moses agreed to stay with the man, and he gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage.

## Exodus 2:22
She gave birth to a son, and Moses named him Gershom, saying, “I have become a foreigner in a foreign land.”

## Exodus 2:23
During that long period, the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned under their slavery and cried out, and their cry for help went up to God.

## Exodus 2:24
God heard their groaning and remembered His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

## Exodus 2:25
So God looked on the Israelites and was concerned about them.
