# Exodus Chapter 20

## Exodus 20:1
Then God spoke all these words:

## Exodus 20:2
“I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.

## Exodus 20:3
You shall have no other gods before Me.

## Exodus 20:4
You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above, on the earth beneath, or in the waters below.

## Exodus 20:5
You shall not bow down to them or serve them. For I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sins of the parents to the third and fourth generation of those who hate Me,

## Exodus 20:6
but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love Me and keep My commandments.

## Exodus 20:7
You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God, for the Lord will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses His name.

## Exodus 20:8
Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.

## Exodus 20:9
Six days you shall labour and do all your work,

## Exodus 20:10
but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your servants, nor your animals, nor any foreigner residing in your towns.

## Exodus 20:11
For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but He rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.

## Exodus 20:12
Honour your father and your mother, so that your days may be long in the land the Lord your God is giving you.

## Exodus 20:13
You shall not murder.

## Exodus 20:14
You shall not commit adultery.

## Exodus 20:15
You shall not steal.

## Exodus 20:16
You shall not give false testimony against your neighbour.

## Exodus 20:17
You shall not covet your neighbour’s house. You shall not covet your neighbour’s wife, or their servant, ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbour.

## Exodus 20:18
When all the people saw the thunder and lightning, and heard the trumpet and saw the mountain in smoke, they trembled with fear. They stood at a distance

## Exodus 20:19
and said to Moses, “Speak to us yourself and we will listen. But do not let God speak to us, or we will die.”

## Exodus 20:20
Moses said to the people, “Do not be afraid. God has come to test you, so that the fear of Him will be with you and keep you from sinning.”

## Exodus 20:21
The people remained at a distance, while Moses approached the thick darkness where God was.

## Exodus 20:22
Then the Lord said to Moses, “Tell the Israelites: You have seen for yourselves that I have spoken to you from heaven.

## Exodus 20:23
Do not make any gods to be alongside Me; do not make for yourselves gods of silver or gods of gold.

## Exodus 20:24
Make an altar of earth for Me and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, your sheep and goats and your cattle. Wherever I cause My name to be honoured, I will come to you and bless you.

## Exodus 20:25
If you make an altar of stones for Me, do not build it with dressed stones, for you will defile it if you use a tool on it.

## Exodus 20:26
And do not go up to My altar on steps, or your private parts may be exposed.”
