# Exodus Chapter 7

## Exodus 7:1

Then the Lord said to Moses, “See, I have made you like God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron will be your prophet.

## Exodus 7:2

You must say everything I command you, and your brother Aaron is to tell Pharaoh to let the Israelites go out of his country.

## Exodus 7:3

But I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and though I multiply My signs and wonders in Egypt,

## Exodus 7:4

Pharaoh will not listen to you. Then I will lay My hand on Egypt and bring My people the Israelites out by great acts of judgment.

## Exodus 7:5

And the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord when I stretch out My hand against Egypt and bring the Israelites out from among them.

## Exodus 7:6

Moses and Aaron did just as the Lord commanded them.

## Exodus 7:7

Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three when they spoke to Pharaoh.

## Exodus 7:8

The Lord said to Moses and Aaron,

## Exodus 7:9

“When Pharaoh says to you, ‘Perform a miracle,’ then say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh,’ and it will become a serpent.”

## Exodus 7:10

So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did just as the Lord had commanded. Aaron threw down his staff before Pharaoh and it became a serpent.

## Exodus 7:11

Pharaoh then summoned wise men and sorcerers, and the Egyptian magicians did the same things by their secret arts.

## Exodus 7:12

Each one threw down his staff and it became a serpent. But Aaron’s staff swallowed up their staffs.

## Exodus 7:13

Still Pharaoh’s heart was hardened and he would not listen to them, just as the Lord had said.

## Exodus 7:14

Then the Lord said to Moses, “Pharaoh’s heart is unyielding; he refuses to let the people go.

## Exodus 7:15

Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he goes out to the water. Stand on the bank of the Nile and take in your hand the staff that was turned into a snake.

## Exodus 7:16

Say to him, ‘The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to say: Let My people go, so that they may worship Me in the wilderness. But until now you have not listened.

## Exodus 7:17

This is what the Lord says: By this you will know that I am the Lord: With the staff in my hand I will strike the water of the Nile, and it will be changed into blood.

## Exodus 7:18

The fish in the Nile will die, the river will stink, and the Egyptians will not be able to drink its water.’”

## Exodus 7:19

The Lord said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt... and they will turn to blood.’

## Exodus 7:20

Moses and Aaron did just as the Lord had commanded. Aaron raised the staff and struck the water of the Nile in the sight of Pharaoh and his officials, and all the water was changed into blood.

## Exodus 7:21

The fish in the Nile died, and the river smelled so bad that the Egyptians could not drink its water. Blood was everywhere in Egypt.

## Exodus 7:22

But the Egyptian magicians did the same by their secret arts, and Pharaoh’s heart became hard; he would not listen.

## Exodus 7:23

He turned and went into his palace, and did not take this to heart.

## Exodus 7:24

All the Egyptians dug along the Nile to get drinking water, because they could not drink the water of the river.

## Exodus 7:25

Seven days passed after the Lord struck the Nile.
