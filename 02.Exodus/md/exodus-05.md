# Exodus Chapter 5

## Exodus 5:1
Afterward Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘Let My people go, so that they may hold a festival to Me in the wilderness.’”

## Exodus 5:2
Pharaoh said, “Who is the Lord, that I should obey Him and let Israel go? I do not know the Lord and I will not let Israel go.”

## Exodus 5:3
Then they said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the Lord our God, or He may strike us with plagues or the sword.”

## Exodus 5:4
But the king of Egypt said, “Moses and Aaron, why are you distracting the people from their work? Get back to your labour!”

## Exodus 5:5
Pharaoh said, “The people are now numerous, and you are stopping them from working.”

## Exodus 5:6
That same day Pharaoh gave orders to the slave drivers and overseers:

## Exodus 5:7
“You are no longer to supply straw for the bricks. Let them go and gather their own straw.

## Exodus 5:8
But require them to make the same number of bricks as before; don’t reduce the quota. They are lazy—that’s why they cry out, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’

## Exodus 5:9
Make the work harder so that they keep working and don’t pay attention to lies.”

## Exodus 5:10
So the slave drivers and overseers went out and said to the people, “This is what Pharaoh says: I will not give you any more straw.

## Exodus 5:11
Go and gather your own straw wherever you can find it, but your work will not be reduced.”

## Exodus 5:12
So the people scattered all over Egypt to gather stubble to use as straw.

## Exodus 5:13
The slave drivers kept pressing them, saying, “Complete the work required of you for each day, just as when you had straw.”

## Exodus 5:14
And Pharaoh’s overseers beat the Israelite foremen, demanding, “Why haven’t you met your quota of bricks yesterday or today, as before?”

## Exodus 5:15
Then the Israelite foremen went and appealed to Pharaoh: “Why have you treated your servants this way?

## Exodus 5:16
Your servants are given no straw, yet we are told, ‘Make bricks!’ Your servants are being beaten, but the fault is with your own people.”

## Exodus 5:17
Pharaoh said, “Lazy! That’s what you are—lazy! That’s why you say, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to the Lord.’

## Exodus 5:18
Now get to work. You will not be given any straw, yet you must produce your full quota of bricks.”

## Exodus 5:19
The Israelite foremen realised they were in trouble when they were told, “You must not reduce the number of bricks required of you each day.”

## Exodus 5:20
When they left Pharaoh, they found Moses and Aaron waiting to meet them,

## Exodus 5:21
and they said, “May the Lord look on you and judge you! You have made us obnoxious to Pharaoh and his officials and have put a sword in their hand to kill us.”

## Exodus 5:22
Moses returned to the Lord and said, “Why, Lord, have You brought trouble on this people? Is this why You sent me?

## Exodus 5:23
Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has brought trouble on this people, and You have not rescued Your people at all.”
