# Exodus Chapter 23

## Exodus 23:1
Do not spread false reports. Do not help a guilty person by being a malicious witness.

## Exodus 23:2
Do not follow the crowd in doing wrong. When you give testimony in a lawsuit, do not pervert justice by siding with the majority,

## Exodus 23:3
and do not show favouritism to a poor person in a lawsuit.

## Exodus 23:4
If you come across your enemy’s ox or donkey wandering off, be sure to return it.

## Exodus 23:5
If you see the donkey of someone who hates you fallen under its load, do not ignore it; help the animal.

## Exodus 23:6
Do not deny justice to the poor in their lawsuits.

## Exodus 23:7
Have nothing to do with a false charge and do not put an innocent person to death, for I will not acquit the guilty.

## Exodus 23:8
Do not accept bribes, for bribes blind those who see and twist the words of the innocent.

## Exodus 23:9
Do not oppress a foreigner; you yourselves know how it feels to be foreigners, because you were foreigners in Egypt.

## Exodus 23:10
For six years you are to sow your fields and gather their produce,

## Exodus 23:11
but in the seventh year let the land lie unploughed and unused. Then the poor among your people may get food from it, and the wild animals can eat what is left. Do the same with your vineyards and olive groves.

## Exodus 23:12
Six days do your work, but on the seventh day do not work, so that your ox and donkey may rest, and the child of your servant and the foreigner may be refreshed.

## Exodus 23:13
Be careful to do everything I have said to you. Do not invoke the names of other gods; do not let them be heard on your lips.

## Exodus 23:14
Three times a year you are to celebrate a festival to Me.

## Exodus 23:15
Celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread; for seven days eat bread made without yeast, as I commanded you. Do this at the appointed time in the month of Aviv, for in that month you came out of Egypt. No one is to appear before Me empty-handed.

## Exodus 23:16
Celebrate the Festival of Harvest with the firstfruits of the crops you sow in your field. Celebrate the Festival of Ingathering at the end of the year, when you gather your crops from the field.

## Exodus 23:17
Three times a year all your men are to appear before the Sovereign Lord.

## Exodus 23:18
Do not offer the blood of a sacrifice to Me along with anything containing yeast, and do not let the fat from My festival offerings remain until morning.

## Exodus 23:19
Bring the best of the firstfruits of your soil to the house of the Lord your God. Do not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk.

## Exodus 23:20
I am sending an angel ahead of you to guard you along the way and to bring you to the place I have prepared.

## Exodus 23:21
Pay attention to him and listen to what he says. Do not rebel against him; he will not forgive your rebellion, since My Name is in him.

## Exodus 23:22
If you listen carefully to what he says and do all that I say, I will be an enemy to your enemies and will oppose those who oppose you.

## Exodus 23:23
My angel will go ahead of you and bring you into the lands of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hivites and Jebusites, and I will wipe them out.

## Exodus 23:24
Do not bow down before their gods or worship them or follow their practices. You must demolish them and break their sacred stones to pieces.

## Exodus 23:25
Worship the Lord your God, and His blessing will be on your food and water. I will take away illness from among you,

## Exodus 23:26
and none will miscarry or be barren in your land. I will give you a full lifespan.

## Exodus 23:27
I will send My terror ahead of you and throw into confusion every nation you encounter. I will make all your enemies turn their backs and run.

## Exodus 23:28
I will send hornets ahead of you to drive out the Hivites, Canaanites and Hittites from before you.

## Exodus 23:29
But I will not drive them out in a single year, because the land would become desolate and the wild animals too numerous for you.

## Exodus 23:30
Little by little I will drive them out before you, until you have increased enough to take possession of the land.

## Exodus 23:31
I will establish your borders from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean, and from the desert to the Euphrates River. I will give into your hands the people who live in the land, and you will drive them out.

## Exodus 23:32
Do not make a covenant with them or with their gods.

## Exodus 23:33
They must not live in your land, or they will cause you to sin against Me, because the worship of their gods will certainly be a snare to you.
