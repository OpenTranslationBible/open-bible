# Genesis Chapter 4

## Genesis 4:1
Now Adam had relations with his wife Eve, and she conceived and gave birth to Cain. She said, “With the help of the Lord I have brought forth a man.”

## Genesis 4:2
Later she gave birth to his brother Abel. Now Abel kept flocks, and Cain worked the soil.

## Genesis 4:3
In the course of time, Cain brought an offering to the Lord from the fruit of the ground.

## Genesis 4:4
And Abel also brought an offering—fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. The Lord looked with favour on Abel and his offering,

## Genesis 4:5
but on Cain and his offering He did not look with favour. So Cain became very angry, and his face fell.

## Genesis 4:6
Then the Lord said to Cain, “Why are you angry? And why is your face downcast?

## Genesis 4:7
If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to dominate you, but you must master it.”

## Genesis 4:8
Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let’s go out to the field.” And while they were in the field, Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him.

## Genesis 4:9
Then the Lord said to Cain, “Where is your brother Abel?” He replied, “I do not know. Am I my brother’s keeper?”

## Genesis 4:10
The Lord said, “What have you done? Listen! Your brother’s blood cries out to Me from the ground.

## Genesis 4:11
Now you are cursed and banished from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.

## Genesis 4:12
When you work the ground, it will no longer yield its produce for you. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth.”

## Genesis 4:13
Cain said to the Lord, “My punishment is more than I can bear!

## Genesis 4:14
Today You are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from Your presence. I will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.”

## Genesis 4:15
But the Lord said to him, “Not so! Anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over.” Then the Lord put a mark on Cain so that no one who found him would kill him.

## Genesis 4:16
So Cain went out from the Lord’s presence and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden.

## Genesis 4:17
Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and gave birth to Enoch. Cain built a city and named it after his son Enoch.

## Genesis 4:18
To Enoch was born Irad. Irad was the father of Mehujael, Mehujael the father of Methushael, and Methushael the father of Lamech.

## Genesis 4:19
Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah.

## Genesis 4:20
Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock.

## Genesis 4:21
His brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play stringed instruments and pipes.

## Genesis 4:22
Zillah also had a son, Tubal-Cain, who forged all kinds of tools out of bronze and iron. Tubal-Cain’s sister was Naamah.

## Genesis 4:23
Lamech said to his wives: “Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; wives of Lamech, listen to my words. I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for striking me.

## Genesis 4:24
If Cain is avenged seven times, then Lamech seventy-seven times.”

## Genesis 4:25
Adam knew his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth, saying, “God has granted me another child in place of Abel, since Cain killed him.”

## Genesis 4:26
To Seth also a son was born, and he named him Enosh. At that time people began to call upon the name of the Lord.
