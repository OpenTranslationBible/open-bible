# Genesis Chapter 41

## Genesis 41:1
Two years later, Pharaoh had a dream: he was standing by the Nile,

## Genesis 41:2
when seven healthy, well-fed cows came up out of the river and grazed among the reeds.

## Genesis 41:3
After them, seven other cows, sickly and thin, came up out of the Nile and stood beside the healthy cows on the riverbank.

## Genesis 41:4
And the thin, ugly cows ate up the seven healthy, fat cows. Then Pharaoh woke up.

## Genesis 41:5
He fell asleep again and had a second dream: seven heads of grain, full and good, were growing on a single stalk.

## Genesis 41:6
After them, seven other heads of grain sprouted—thin and scorched by the east wind.

## Genesis 41:7
The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy, full heads. Then Pharaoh woke up; it had been a dream.

## Genesis 41:8
In the morning, his spirit was troubled. So he sent for all the magicians and wise men of Egypt. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them for him.

## Genesis 41:9
Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, “Today I am reminded of my shortcomings.

## Genesis 41:10
Pharaoh was once angry with his servants and confined me and the chief baker to the house of the captain of the guard.

## Genesis 41:11
Each of us had a dream the same night, and each dream had its own meaning.

## Genesis 41:12
Now a young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard. We told him our dreams, and he interpreted them, giving each of us the interpretation of our dream.

## Genesis 41:13
And things turned out exactly as he interpreted: I was restored to my position, and the other man was executed.”

## Genesis 41:14
So Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and he was quickly brought from the dungeon. When he had shaved and changed his clothes, he came before Pharaoh.

## Genesis 41:15
Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I had a dream, and no one can interpret it. But I’ve heard it said that you can hear a dream and explain it.”

## Genesis 41:16
“I cannot do it,” Joseph replied, “but God will give Pharaoh the answer he desires.”
