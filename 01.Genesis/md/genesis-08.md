# Genesis Chapter 8

## Genesis 8:1
But God remembered Noah and all the wild animals and the livestock that were with him in the ark, and He sent a wind over the earth, and the waters began to recede.

## Genesis 8:2
Now the springs of the deep and the windows of the heavens were closed, and the rain from the sky was restrained.

## Genesis 8:3
The waters receded steadily from the earth. At the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters had gone down,

## Genesis 8:4
and on the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.

## Genesis 8:5
The waters continued to recede until the tenth month, and on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains became visible.

## Genesis 8:6
After forty more days Noah opened a window he had made in the ark

## Genesis 8:7
and sent out a raven, and it kept flying back and forth until the waters had dried up from the earth.

## Genesis 8:8
Then he sent out a dove to see if the waters had receded from the surface of the ground.

## Genesis 8:9
But the dove found no place to land, because there was water over the surface of the whole earth; so it returned to Noah in the ark. He reached out his hand, took the dove, and brought it back to himself.

## Genesis 8:10
He waited seven more days and again sent out the dove from the ark.

## Genesis 8:11
When the dove returned to him in the evening, there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf! Then Noah knew that the water had receded from the earth.

## Genesis 8:12
He waited seven more days and sent the dove out again, but this time it did not return to him.

## Genesis 8:13
By the first day of the first month of Noah’s six hundred and first year, the water had dried up from the earth. Noah removed the covering of the ark and saw that the surface of the ground was dry.

## Genesis 8:14
By the twenty-seventh day of the second month the earth was completely dry.

## Genesis 8:15
Then God said to Noah,

## Genesis 8:16
“Come out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and their wives.

## Genesis 8:17
Bring out every living creature that is with you—all the birds, animals, and every creature that moves along the ground—so they can multiply and fill the earth.”

## Genesis 8:18
So Noah came out, together with his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives.

## Genesis 8:19
All the animals and every creeping thing and every bird—everything that moves on the earth—came out of the ark by families.

## Genesis 8:20
Then Noah built an altar to the Lord and took some of all the clean animals and clean birds and offered burnt offerings on the altar.

## Genesis 8:21
The Lord smelled the pleasing aroma and said in His heart, “Never again will I curse the ground because of man, even though the thoughts of the human heart are evil from youth. And never again will I destroy all living creatures as I have done.

## Genesis 8:22
As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night shall not cease.”
