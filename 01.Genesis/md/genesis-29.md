# Genesis Chapter 29

## Genesis 29:1
Then Jacob continued on his journey and came to the land of the eastern peoples.

## Genesis 29:2
There he saw a well in the open country, with three flocks of sheep lying near it because the flocks were watered from that well. A large stone covered the mouth of the well.

## Genesis 29:3
When all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone away from the well’s mouth and water the sheep. Then they would return the stone to its place.

## Genesis 29:4
Jacob asked the shepherds, “My brothers, where are you from?” “We’re from Haran,” they replied.

## Genesis 29:5
He said to them, “Do you know Laban, Nahor’s grandson?” “Yes, we know him,” they answered.

## Genesis 29:6
Then Jacob asked them, “Is he well?” “Yes, he is,” they said, “and here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep.”

## Genesis 29:7
“Look,” he said, “the sun is still high; it’s not time for the flocks to be gathered. Water the sheep and take them back to pasture.”

## Genesis 29:8
But they replied, “We can’t until all the flocks are gathered and the stone has been rolled away from the mouth of the well. Then we will water the sheep.”

## Genesis 29:9
While he was still talking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep, for she was a shepherd.

## Genesis 29:10
When Jacob saw Rachel daughter of Laban, his mother’s brother, and Laban’s sheep, he went over and rolled the stone away from the well and watered his uncle’s sheep.

## Genesis 29:11
Then Jacob kissed Rachel and began to weep aloud.

## Genesis 29:12
He had told Rachel that he was a relative of her father and a son of Rebekah. So she ran and told her father.

## Genesis 29:13
As soon as Laban heard the news about Jacob, his sister’s son, he hurried to meet him. He embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his home. Jacob told him everything.

## Genesis 29:14
Then Laban said to him, “You are truly my own flesh and blood.” After Jacob had stayed with him for a month,

## Genesis 29:15
Laban said to him, “Just because you are a relative of mine, should you work for me for nothing? Tell me what your wages should be.”

## Genesis 29:16
Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.

## Genesis 29:17
Leah had weak eyes, but Rachel had a lovely figure and was beautiful.

## Genesis 29:18
Jacob was in love with Rachel and said, “I’ll work for you seven years in return for your younger daughter Rachel.”

## Genesis 29:19
Laban said, “It’s better that I give her to you than to some other man. Stay here with me.”

## Genesis 29:20
So Jacob served seven years to get Rachel, but they seemed like only a few days to him because of his love for her.

## Genesis 29:21
Then Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife. My time is completed, and I want to lie with her.”

## Genesis 29:22
So Laban brought together all the people of the place and gave a feast.

## Genesis 29:23
But when evening came, he took his daughter Leah and gave her to Jacob, and Jacob lay with her.

## Genesis 29:24
And Laban gave his servant Zilpah to his daughter as her maidservant.

## Genesis 29:25
When morning came, there was Leah! So Jacob said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? I served you for Rachel, didn’t I? Why have you deceived me?”

## Genesis 29:26
Laban replied, “It is not our custom here to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older one.

## Genesis 29:27
Finish this daughter’s bridal week; then we will give you the younger one also, in return for another seven years of work.”

## Genesis 29:28
And Jacob did so. He finished the week with Leah, and then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife.

## Genesis 29:29
Laban gave his servant Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her maidservant.

## Genesis 29:30
Jacob lay with Rachel also, and he loved Rachel more than Leah. And he worked for Laban another seven years.

## Genesis 29:31
When the Lord saw that Leah was unloved, He enabled her to conceive, but Rachel remained childless.

## Genesis 29:32
Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Reuben, for she said, “It is because the Lord has seen my misery. Surely my husband will love me now.”

## Genesis 29:33
She conceived again, and when she gave birth to a son she said, “Because the Lord heard that I am unloved, He gave me this one too.” So she named him Simeon.

## Genesis 29:34
Again she conceived, and when she gave birth to a son she said, “Now at last my husband will become attached to me, because I have borne him three sons.” So he was named Levi.

## Genesis 29:35
She conceived again, and when she gave birth to a son she said, “This time I will praise the Lord.” So she named him Judah. Then she stopped having children.
