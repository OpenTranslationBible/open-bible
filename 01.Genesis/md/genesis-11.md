# Genesis Chapter 11

## Genesis 11:1
Now the whole earth had one language and a common vocabulary.

## Genesis 11:2
As people moved eastward, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there.

## Genesis 11:3
They said to one another, “Come, let’s make bricks and bake them thoroughly.” They used brick instead of stone, and tar for mortar.

## Genesis 11:4
Then they said, “Come, let’s build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves and not be scattered over the face of the whole earth.”

## Genesis 11:5
But the Lord came down to see the city and the tower that the people were building.

## Genesis 11:6
The Lord said, “If they have begun to do this as one people speaking the same language, then nothing they plan will be impossible for them.

## Genesis 11:7
Come, let Us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand one another.”

## Genesis 11:8
So the Lord scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city.

## Genesis 11:9
That is why it was called Babel—because there the Lord confused the language of the whole world. From there the Lord scattered them over the face of the whole earth.
