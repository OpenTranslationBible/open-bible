# Genesis Chapter 40

## Genesis 40:1
Some time later, the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt offended their master, the king of Egypt.

## Genesis 40:2
Pharaoh was angry with his two officials, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker,

## Genesis 40:3
and put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the same prison where Joseph was confined.

## Genesis 40:4
The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he attended them.

## Genesis 40:5
Each of the two men had a dream the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own.

## Genesis 40:6
When Joseph came to them the next morning, he saw that they were dejected.

## Genesis 40:7
So he asked Pharaoh’s officials, “Why do you look so sad today?”

## Genesis 40:8
“We both had dreams,” they answered, “but there is no one to interpret them.” Then Joseph said to them, “Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell me your dreams.”

## Genesis 40:9
So the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream.

## Genesis 40:10
He said to him, “In my dream I saw a vine with three branches.

## Genesis 40:11
As soon as it budded, it blossomed, and its clusters ripened into grapes.

## Genesis 40:12
Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, squeezed them into Pharaoh’s cup and put the cup in his hand.”

## Genesis 40:13
“This is what it means,” Joseph said. “The three branches are three days.

## Genesis 40:14
Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your position.

## Genesis 40:15
But when all goes well with you, remember me and show me kindness; mention me to Pharaoh and get me out of this prison.

## Genesis 40:16
I was forcibly carried off from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing to deserve being put in a dungeon.”

## Genesis 40:17
When the chief baker saw that Joseph had given a favourable interpretation, he said to Joseph, “I too had a dream.

## Genesis 40:18
On my head were three baskets of bread.

## Genesis 40:19
In the top basket were all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.”

## Genesis 40:20
“This is what it means,” Joseph said. “The three baskets are three days.

## Genesis 40:21
Within three days Pharaoh will lift off your head and impale your body on a pole. And the birds will eat away your flesh.”

## Genesis 40:22
Now the third day was Pharaoh’s birthday, and he gave a feast for all his officials.

## Genesis 40:23
He restored the chief cupbearer to his position, so that he once again put the cup into Pharaoh’s hand—

## Genesis 40:24
but he impaled the chief baker, just as Joseph had said in his interpretation.

## Genesis 40:25
The chief cupbearer, however, did not remember Joseph; he forgot him.
