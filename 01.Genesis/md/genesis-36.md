# Genesis Chapter 36

## Genesis 36:1
This is the account of the family line of Esau (that is, Edom).

## Genesis 36:2
Esau took his wives from the women of Canaan: Adah daughter of Elon the Hittite, Oholibamah daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite,

## Genesis 36:3
also Basemath daughter of Ishmael and sister of Nebaioth.

## Genesis 36:4
Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, Basemath bore Reuel,

## Genesis 36:5
and Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam and Korah. These were the sons of Esau, who were born to him in Canaan.

## Genesis 36:6
Esau took his wives, his sons and daughters and all the members of his household, as well as his livestock and all his other animals and all the goods he had acquired in Canaan, and moved to a land some distance from his brother Jacob.

## Genesis 36:7
Their possessions were too great for them to remain together; the land where they were staying could not support them both because of their livestock.

## Genesis 36:8
So Esau settled in the hill country of Seir. (Esau is Edom.)
