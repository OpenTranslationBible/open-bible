# Genesis Chapter 39

## Genesis 39:1
Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt. Potiphar, an Egyptian who was one of Pharaoh’s officials, the captain of the guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him there.

## Genesis 39:2
The Lord was with Joseph so that he prospered, and he lived in the house of his Egyptian master.

## Genesis 39:3
When his master saw that the Lord was with him and that the Lord gave him success in everything he did,

## Genesis 39:4
Joseph found favour in his eyes and became his attendant. Potiphar put him in charge of his household, and he entrusted to his care everything he owned.

## Genesis 39:5
From the time he put him in charge of his household and of all that he owned, the Lord blessed the household of the Egyptian because of Joseph.

## Genesis 39:6
Now Joseph was well-built and handsome.

## Genesis 39:7
And after a while his master’s wife took notice of Joseph and said, “Come to bed with me!”

## Genesis 39:8
But he refused. “With me in charge,” he told her, “my master does not concern himself with anything in the house; everything he owns he has entrusted to my care.

## Genesis 39:9
No one is greater in this house than I am. My master has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How then could I do such a wicked thing and sin against God?”

## Genesis 39:10
And though she spoke to Joseph day after day, he refused to go to bed with her or even be with her.

## Genesis 39:11
One day he went into the house to attend to his duties, and none of the household servants was inside.

## Genesis 39:12
She caught him by his cloak and said, “Come to bed with me!” But he left his cloak in her hand and ran out of the house.

## Genesis 39:13
When she saw that he had left his cloak in her hand and had run out of the house,

## Genesis 39:14
she called her household servants. “Look,” she said, “this Hebrew has been brought to us to make sport of us! He came in here to sleep with me, but I screamed.

## Genesis 39:15
When he heard me scream, he ran out, leaving his cloak beside me.”

## Genesis 39:16
She kept his cloak beside her until his master came home.

## Genesis 39:17
Then she told him this story: “That Hebrew slave you brought us came to me to make sport of me.

## Genesis 39:18
But as soon as I screamed for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house.”

## Genesis 39:19
When his master heard the story his wife told him, he burned with anger.

## Genesis 39:20
Joseph’s master took him and put him in prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were confined.

## Genesis 39:21
But the Lord was with Joseph; He showed him kindness and granted him favour in the eyes of the prison warden.

## Genesis 39:22
So the warden put Joseph in charge of all those held in the prison, and he was made responsible for all that was done there.

## Genesis 39:23
The warden paid no attention to anything under Joseph’s care, because the Lord was with Joseph and gave him success in whatever he did.
