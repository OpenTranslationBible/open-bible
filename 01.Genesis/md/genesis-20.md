# Genesis Chapter 20

## Genesis 20:1
Now Abraham moved on from there into the region of the Negev and lived between Kadesh and Shur. For a time he stayed in Gerar.

## Genesis 20:2
There Abraham said of his wife Sarah, “She is my sister.” So Abimelek king of Gerar sent for Sarah and took her.

## Genesis 20:3
But God came to Abimelek in a dream one night and said to him, “You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken; she is a married woman.”

## Genesis 20:4
Now Abimelek had not gone near her, so he said, “Lord, will You destroy an innocent nation?

## Genesis 20:5
Did he not say to me, ‘She is my sister,’ and didn’t she also say, ‘He is my brother’? I have done this with a clear conscience and clean hands.”

## Genesis 20:6
Then God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know you did this with a clear conscience, and so I have kept you from sinning against Me. That is why I did not let you touch her.

## Genesis 20:7
Now return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not return her, be assured that you and all who belong to you will surely die.”

## Genesis 20:8
Early the next morning Abimelek summoned all his officials, and when he told them all that had happened, they were very afraid.

## Genesis 20:9
Then Abimelek called Abraham in and said, “What have you done to us? How have I wronged you that you have brought such guilt upon me and my kingdom?

## Genesis 20:10
Abimelek asked Abraham, “What was your reason for doing this?”

## Genesis 20:11
Abraham replied, “I said to myself, ‘There is surely no fear of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.’

## Genesis 20:12
Besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father though not of my mother; and she became my wife.

## Genesis 20:13
And when God had me wander from my father’s household, I said to her, ‘Show your loyalty to me wherever we go: say of me, “He is my brother.”’”

## Genesis 20:14
Then Abimelek brought sheep and cattle and male and female servants and gave them to Abraham, and he returned Sarah to him.

## Genesis 20:15
And Abimelek said, “My land is before you; live wherever you like.”

## Genesis 20:16
To Sarah he said, “I am giving your brother a thousand shekels of silver. This is to cover the offense against you before all who are with you; you are completely vindicated.”

## Genesis 20:17
Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelek, his wife and his female slaves so they could have children again,

## Genesis 20:18
for the Lord had kept all the women in Abimelek’s household from conceiving because of Abraham’s wife Sarah.
