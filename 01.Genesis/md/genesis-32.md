# Genesis Chapter 32

## Genesis 32:1
Jacob also went on his way, and the angels of God met him.

## Genesis 32:2
When Jacob saw them, he said, “This is the camp of God!” So he named that place Mahanaim.

## Genesis 32:3
Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom.

## Genesis 32:4
He instructed them: “This is what you are to say to my lord Esau: ‘Your servant Jacob says, I have been staying with Laban and have remained there till now.

## Genesis 32:5
I have cattle and donkeys, sheep and goats, male and female servants. Now I am sending this message to my lord, that I may find favour in your eyes.’”

## Genesis 32:6
When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said, “We went to your brother Esau, and now he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.”

## Genesis 32:7
In great fear and distress Jacob divided the people with him into two groups, and the flocks and herds and camels as well.

## Genesis 32:8
He thought, “If Esau comes and attacks one group, the other group that is left may escape.”

## Genesis 32:9
Then Jacob prayed, “O God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, Lord, You who said to me, ‘Go back to your country and your relatives, and I will make you prosper,’

## Genesis 32:10
I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness You have shown Your servant. I had only my staff when I crossed this Jordan, but now I have become two camps.

## Genesis 32:11
Save me, I pray, from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid he will come and attack me, and also the mothers with their children.

## Genesis 32:12
But You have said, ‘I will surely make you prosper and will make your descendants like the sand of the sea, which cannot be counted.’”

## Genesis 32:13
He spent the night there, and from what he had with him he selected a gift for his brother Esau:

## Genesis 32:14
two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,

## Genesis 32:15
thirty female camels with their young, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.

## Genesis 32:16
He put them in the care of his servants, each herd by itself, and said to his servants, “Go ahead of me, and keep some space between the herds.”

## Genesis 32:17
He instructed the one in the lead: “When my brother Esau meets you and asks, ‘To whom do you belong, and where are you going, and who owns all these animals in front of you?’

## Genesis 32:18
then you are to say, ‘They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift sent to my lord Esau, and he is coming behind us.’”

## Genesis 32:19
He also instructed the second, the third, and all the others who followed the herds: “You are to say the same thing to Esau when you meet him.

## Genesis 32:20
And be sure to say, ‘Your servant Jacob is coming behind us.’” For he thought, “I will pacify him with these gifts I am sending ahead; later, when I see him, perhaps he will receive me.”

## Genesis 32:21
So Jacob’s gifts went on ahead of him, but he himself spent the night in the camp.

## Genesis 32:22
That night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two female servants and his eleven sons and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.

## Genesis 32:23
After he had sent them across the stream, he sent over all his possessions.

## Genesis 32:24
So Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him till daybreak.

## Genesis 32:25
When the man saw that he could not overpower him, he touched the socket of Jacob’s hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man.

## Genesis 32:26
Then the man said, “Let me go, for it is daybreak.” But Jacob replied, “I will not let you go unless you bless me.”

## Genesis 32:27
The man asked him, “What is your name?” “Jacob,” he answered.

## Genesis 32:28
Then the man said, “Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with humans and have overcome.”

## Genesis 32:29
Jacob said, “Please tell me your name.” But he replied, “Why do you ask my name?” Then he blessed him there.

## Genesis 32:30
So Jacob called the place Peniel, saying, “It is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared.”

## Genesis 32:31
The sun rose above him as he passed Peniel, and he was limping because of his hip.

## Genesis 32:32
Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the tendon attached to the socket of the hip, because the socket of Jacob’s hip was touched near the tendon.
