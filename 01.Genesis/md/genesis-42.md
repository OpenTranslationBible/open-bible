# Genesis Chapter 42

## Genesis 42:1
When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, “Why do you just keep looking at each other?”

## Genesis 42:2
He continued, “I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us, so that we may live and not die.”

## Genesis 42:3
Then ten of Joseph’s brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.

## Genesis 42:4
But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, with the others, because he was afraid that harm might come to him.

## Genesis 42:5
So Israel’s sons were among those who went to buy grain, for there was famine in the land of Canaan also.

## Genesis 42:6
Now Joseph was the governor of the land, the person who sold grain to all its people. So when Joseph’s brothers arrived, they bowed down to him with their faces to the ground.

## Genesis 42:7
As soon as Joseph saw his brothers, he recognised them, but he pretended to be a stranger and spoke harshly to them.
