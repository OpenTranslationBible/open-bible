# Genesis Chapter 13

## Genesis 13:1
So Abram went up from Egypt to the Negev with his wife and everything he had, and Lot went with him.

## Genesis 13:2
Abram had become very wealthy in livestock, silver, and gold.

## Genesis 13:3
From the Negev, he went from place to place until he came to Bethel, to the place between Bethel and Ai where his tent had been earlier.

## Genesis 13:4
It was the place where he had first built an altar, and there Abram called on the name of the Lord.

## Genesis 13:5
Now Lot, who was moving about with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents.

## Genesis 13:6
But the land could not support them while they stayed together, for their possessions were so great that they could not remain together.

## Genesis 13:7
And conflict arose between the herders of Abram’s livestock and the herders of Lot’s livestock. The Canaanites and Perizzites were also living in the land at that time.

## Genesis 13:8
So Abram said to Lot, “Let there be no strife between you and me, or between your herders and mine, for we are close relatives.

## Genesis 13:9
Is not the whole land before you? Let’s part ways. If you go to the left, I’ll go to the right; if you go to the right, I’ll go to the left.”

## Genesis 13:10
Lot looked around and saw that the whole plain of the Jordan toward Zoar was well watered, like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt. This was before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.

## Genesis 13:11
So Lot chose for himself the whole plain of the Jordan and set out toward the east. The two men parted company.

## Genesis 13:12
Abram lived in the land of Canaan, while Lot lived among the cities of the plain and pitched his tents near Sodom.

## Genesis 13:13
Now the people of Sodom were wicked and were sinning greatly against the Lord.

## Genesis 13:14
The Lord said to Abram after Lot had parted from him, “Lift up your eyes from where you are and look north, south, east and west.

## Genesis 13:15
All the land that you see I will give to you and your offspring forever.

## Genesis 13:16
I will make your descendants like the dust of the earth, so that if anyone could count the dust, then your descendants could be counted.

## Genesis 13:17
Go, walk through the length and breadth of the land, for I am giving it to you.”

## Genesis 13:18
So Abram moved his tents and went to live near the great trees of Mamre at Hebron, where he built an altar to the Lord.
