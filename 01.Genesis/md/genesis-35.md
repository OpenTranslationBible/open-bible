# Genesis Chapter 35

## Genesis 35:1
Then God said to Jacob, “Go up to Bethel and settle there, and build an altar to God, who appeared to you when you were fleeing from your brother Esau.”

## Genesis 35:2
So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, “Get rid of the foreign gods you have with you, purify yourselves and change your clothes.

## Genesis 35:3
Then come, let us go up to Bethel, where I will build an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress and has been with me wherever I have gone.”

## Genesis 35:4
So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods they had and the rings in their ears, and Jacob buried them under the oak at Shechem.

## Genesis 35:5
Then they set out, and the terror of God fell on the towns all around them so that no one pursued them.

## Genesis 35:6
Jacob and all the people with him came to Luz (that is, Bethel) in the land of Canaan.

## Genesis 35:7
There he built an altar, and he called the place El Bethel, because it was there that God revealed Himself to him when he was fleeing from his brother.

## Genesis 35:8
Now Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died and was buried under the oak outside Bethel. So it was named Allon Bakuth.

## Genesis 35:9
After Jacob returned from Paddan Aram, God appeared to him again and blessed him.

## Genesis 35:10
God said to him, “Your name is Jacob, but you will no longer be called Jacob; your name will be Israel.” So He named him Israel.

## Genesis 35:11
And God said to him, “I am God Almighty; be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a community of nations will come from you, and kings will come from your body.

## Genesis 35:12
The land I gave to Abraham and Isaac I also give to you, and I will give this land to your descendants after you.”

## Genesis 35:13
Then God went up from him at the place where He had talked with him.

## Genesis 35:14
Jacob set up a stone pillar at the place where God had talked with him, and he poured out a drink offering on it; he also poured oil on it.

## Genesis 35:15
Jacob called the place where God had talked with him Bethel.

## Genesis 35:16
Then they moved on from Bethel. While they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel began to give birth and had great difficulty.

## Genesis 35:17
And as she was having great difficulty in childbirth, the midwife said to her, “Don’t be afraid, for you have another son.”

## Genesis 35:18
As she breathed her last—for she was dying—she named her son Ben-Oni. But his father named him Benjamin.

## Genesis 35:19
So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).

## Genesis 35:20
Over her tomb Jacob set up a pillar, and to this day that pillar marks Rachel’s tomb.

## Genesis 35:21
Israel moved on again and pitched his tent beyond Migdal Eder.

## Genesis 35:22
While Israel was living in that region, Reuben went in and slept with his father’s concubine Bilhah, and Israel heard of it.

## Genesis 35:23
Jacob had twelve sons: The sons of Leah: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar and Zebulun.

## Genesis 35:24
The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.

## Genesis 35:25
The sons of Rachel’s servant Bilhah: Dan and Naphtali.

## Genesis 35:26
The sons of Leah’s servant Zilpah: Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan Aram.

## Genesis 35:27
Jacob came home to his father Isaac in Mamre, near Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had stayed.

## Genesis 35:28
Isaac lived a hundred and eighty years.

## Genesis 35:29
Then he breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people, old and full of years. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
