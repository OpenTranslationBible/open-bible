# Hosea Chapter 11

## Hosea 11:1

> When Israel was a youth I loved him,  
> And out of Egypt I called My son.

## Hosea 11:2

> The more they called them,  
> The more they went away from them;  
> They kept sacrificing to the Baals  
> And burning incense to idols.

## Hosea 11:3

> Yet it is I who taught Ephraim to walk,  
> I took them in My arms;  
> But they did not know that I healed them.

## Hosea 11:4

> I pulled them along with cords of a man,  
> With ropes of love,  
> And I became to them as one who lifts the yoke from their jaws;  
> And I bent down and fed them.

## Hosea 11:5

> They will not return to the land of Egypt;  
> But Assyriaâ€”he will be their king  
> Because they refused to return to Me.

## Hosea 11:6

> And the sword will whirl against their cities,  
> And will destroy their oracle priests,  
> And will devour them because of their counsels.

## Hosea 11:7

> So My people are determined to turn from Me.  
> Though they call them to the One on high,  
> None at all exalts Him.

## Hosea 11:8

> How can I give you up, Ephraim?  
> How can I surrender you, Israel?  
> How can I make you like Admah?  
> How can I treat you like Zeboiim?  
> My heart is turned over within Me,  
> All My compassions are kindled.

## Hosea 11:9

> I will not carry out My fierce anger;  
> I will not destroy Ephraim again.  
> For I am God and not a man,  
> The Holy One in your midst,  
> And I will not come in wrath.

## Hosea 11:10

> They will walk after the Lord,  
> He will roar like a lion;  
> Indeed He will roar,  
> And His sons will come trembling from the west.

## Hosea 11:11

> They will come trembling like birds from Egypt,  
> And like doves from the land of Assyria;  
> And I will settle them in their houses, declares the Lord.

## Hosea 11:12

> Ephraim surrounds Me with lies,  
> And the house of Israel with deceit;  
> Judah is also unruly against God,  
> Even against the Holy One who is faithful.
