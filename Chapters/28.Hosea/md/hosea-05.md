# Hosea Chapter 5

## Hosea 5:1

> Hear this, you priests!

> For the judgment applies to you,  
> Because you have been a trap at Mizpah  
> And a net spread out on Tabor.

## Hosea 5:2

> But I will discipline all of them.

> And Israel is not hidden from Me;  
> For now, Ephraim, you have acted promiscuously,  
> Israel has defiled itself.

> To return to their God.  
> For a spirit of prostitution is within them,  
> And they do not know the Lord.

> And Israel and Ephraim stumble in their guilt;  
> Judah also has stumbled with them.

> To seek the Lord, but they will not find Him;  
> He has withdrawn from them.

> For they have given birth to illegitimate children.  
> Now the new moon will devour them with their land.

> Among the tribes of Israel I make known what is certain.

> Ephraim is oppressed, crushed in judgment,  
> Because he was determined to follow man’s command.

## Hosea 5:12

> And like rottenness to the house of Judah.

## Hosea 5:13

> When Ephraim saw his sickness,  
> And Judah his wound,  
> Then Ephraim went to Assyria  
> And sent word to King Jareb.  
> But he is unable to heal you,  
> Or to cure your wound.

## Hosea 5:14

> For I will be like a lion to Ephraim,  
> And like a young lion to the house of Judah.  
> I, yes I, will tear to pieces and go away,  
> I will carry away, and there will be no one to rescue.

## Hosea 5:15

> I will go away and return to My place  
> Until they acknowledge their guilt and seek My face;  
> In their distress they will earnestly seek Me.
