# Hosea Chapter 3

## Hosea 3:1

Then the Lord said to me, “Go again, love a woman who is loved by her husband, yet is committing adultery, as the Lord loves the sons of Israel, though they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes.”

## Hosea 3:2

So I purchased her for myself for fifteen shekels of silver, and a homer and a lethech of barley.

## Hosea 3:3

Then I said to her, “You shall live with me for many days. You shall not prostitute yourself, nor shall you have another man; so I will also be toward you.”

## Hosea 3:4

For the sons of Israel will remain for many days without king or leader, without sacrifice or memorial stone, and without ephod or household idols.

## Hosea 3:5

Afterward the sons of Israel will return and seek the Lord their God and David their king; and they will come trembling to the Lord and to His goodness in the last days.
