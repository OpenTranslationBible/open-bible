# Titus Chapter 1

## Titus 1:1

Paul, a bond-servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the faith of those chosen of God and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,

## Titus 1:2

in the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised long ages ago,

## Titus 1:3

but at the proper time revealed His word in the proclamation with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Saviour;

## Titus 1:4

To Titus, my true son in a common faith:  
Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour.

## Titus 1:5

For this reason I left you in Crete, that you would set in order what remains and appoint elders in every city as I directed you,

## Titus 1:6

namely, if any man is beyond reproach, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, not accused of indecent behaviour or rebellion.

## Titus 1:7

For the overseer must be beyond reproach as God’s steward, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not overindulging in wine, not a bully, not greedy for money,

## Titus 1:8

but hospitable, loving what is good, self-controlled, righteous, holy, disciplined,

## Titus 1:9

holding firmly the faithful word which is in accordance with the teaching, so that he will be able both to exhort in sound doctrine and to refute those who contradict it.

## Titus 1:10

For there are many rebellious people, empty talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,

## Titus 1:11

who must be silenced because they are upsetting whole families, teaching things they should not teach for the sake of dishonest gain.

## Titus 1:12

One of them, a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.”

## Titus 1:13

This testimony is true. For this reason reprimand them severely so that they may be sound in the faith,

## Titus 1:14

not paying attention to Jewish myths and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.

## Titus 1:15

To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure, but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.

## Titus 1:16

They profess to know God, but by their deeds they deny Him, being detestable and disobedient and worthless for any good deed.
