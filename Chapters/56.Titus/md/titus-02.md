# Titus Chapter 2

## Titus 2:1

But as for you, proclaim the things which are fitting for sound doctrine.

## Titus 2:2

Older men are to be temperate, dignified, self-controlled, sound in faith, in love, in perseverance.

## Titus 2:3

Older women likewise are to be reverent in their behaviour, not malicious gossips, nor enslaved to much wine, teaching what is good,

## Titus 2:4

so that they may encourage the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,

## Titus 2:5

to be self-controlled, pure, workers at home, kind, being subject to their own husbands, so that the word of God will not be dishonoured.

## Titus 2:6

Likewise urge the young men to be self-controlled;

## Titus 2:7

in all things show yourself to be an example of good deeds, with purity in doctrine, dignified,

## Titus 2:8

sound in speech which is beyond reproach, so that the opponent will be put to shame, having nothing bad to say about us.

## Titus 2:9

Urge slaves to be subject to their own masters in everything, to be pleasing, not argumentative,

## Titus 2:10

not stealing, but showing all good faith so that they will adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in every respect.

## Titus 2:11

For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all people,

## Titus 2:12

instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live sensibly, righteously, and in a godly manner in the present age,

## Titus 2:13

looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Saviour, Christ Jesus,

## Titus 2:14

who gave Himself for us to redeem us from every lawless deed, and to purify for Himself a people for His own possession, eager for good deeds.

## Titus 2:15

These things speak and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. No one is to disregard you.
