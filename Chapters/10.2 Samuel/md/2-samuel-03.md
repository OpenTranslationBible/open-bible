# 2 Samuel Chapter 3

## 2 Samuel 3:1

Now the war between the house of Saul and the house of David was long;  
and David grew stronger and stronger,  
but the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker.

## 2 Samuel 3:2

Sons were born to David in Hebron:  
his firstborn was Amnon, by Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;

## 2 Samuel 3:3

and his second, Chileab, by Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel;  
and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur;

## 2 Samuel 3:4

and the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith;  
and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;

## 2 Samuel 3:5

and the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah, David’s wife.  
These were born to David in Hebron.

## 2 Samuel 3:6

Now it happened that while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David,  
Abner was strengthening himself in the house of Saul.

## 2 Samuel 3:7

Now Saul had a concubine whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah;  
and Ish-bosheth said to Abner,  
“Why have you gone in to my father’s concubine?”

## 2 Samuel 3:8

Then Abner was very angry over the words of Ish-bosheth and said,  
“Am I a dog’s head that belongs to Judah?  
Today I show kindness to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers and to his friends,  
and have not handed you over to David;  
yet you accuse me today of wrongdoing with a woman?

## 2 Samuel 3:9

May God do so to Abner, and more also,  
if as the Lord has sworn to David, I do not do so for him:

## 2 Samuel 3:10

to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul,  
and to establish the throne of David over Israel and over Judah,  
from Dan even to Beersheba!”

## 2 Samuel 3:11

And Ish-bosheth could no longer answer Abner with a single word,  
because he was afraid of him.

---

## 2 Samuel 3:12

Then Abner sent messengers to David in his place, saying,  
“To whom does the land belong?  
Make your covenant with me, and behold, my hand shall be with you  
to bring all Israel over to you.”

## 2 Samuel 3:13

So David said,  
“Good, I will make a covenant with you.  
But I demand one thing from you:  
you shall not see my face unless you first bring Michal, Saul’s daughter, when you come to see me.”

## 2 Samuel 3:14

So David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, saying,  
“Give me my wife Michal,  
whom I betrothed to myself for a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.”

## 2 Samuel 3:15

So Ish-bosheth sent and took her from her husband, from Paltiel the son of Laish.

## 2 Samuel 3:16

But her husband went with her, weeping as he went,  
following her as far as Bahurim.  
Then Abner said to him, “Go, return.” So he returned.

---

## 2 Samuel 3:17

Now Abner had a consultation with the elders of Israel, saying,  
“In times past you were seeking for David to be king over you.

## 2 Samuel 3:18

Now then, do it! For the Lord has spoken of David, saying,  
‘By the hand of My servant David I will save My people Israel  
from the hand of the Philistines and from the hand of all their enemies.’”

## 2 Samuel 3:19

Abner also spoke in the hearing of Benjamin;  
and in addition Abner went to speak to David in Hebron  
everything that was good in the sight of Israel and in the sight of all the house of Benjamin.

## 2 Samuel 3:20

Then Abner and twenty men with him came to David at Hebron.  
And David held a feast for Abner and the men who were with him.

## 2 Samuel 3:21

Abner said to David, “Let me arise and go and gather all Israel to my lord the king,  
so that they may make a covenant with you,  
and that you may be king over all that your soul desires.”  
So David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.

## 2 Samuel 3:22

And behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a raid  
and brought much plunder with them;  
but Abner was not with David in Hebron, for David had sent him away, and he had gone in peace.

## 2 Samuel 3:23

When Joab and all the army that was with him arrived,  
they informed Joab, saying,  
“Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he has gone in peace.”

## 2 Samuel 3:24

Then Joab came to the king and said,  
“What have you done? Behold, Abner came to you.  
Why then have you sent him away, and he is already gone?

## 2 Samuel 3:25

You know Abner the son of Ner,  
that he came to deceive you and to learn of your movements  
and to know everything that you do.”

---

## 2 Samuel 3:26

When Joab left David, he sent messengers after Abner,  
and they brought him back from the well of Sirah;  
but David did not know it.

## 2 Samuel 3:27

So when Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside into the middle of the gate to speak with him privately,  
and there he struck him in the belly,  
so that he died on account of the blood of Asahel his brother.

---

## 2 Samuel 3:28

Afterward, when David heard about it, he said,  
“I and my kingdom are innocent before the Lord forever of the blood of Abner the son of Ner.

## 2 Samuel 3:29

May it fall on the head of Joab and on all his father’s house,  
and may there not fail from the house of Joab  
one who has a discharge, or who is a leper,  
or who takes hold of a distaff, or who falls by the sword, or who lacks bread.”

## 2 Samuel 3:30

So Joab and Abishai his brother killed Abner,  
because he had put their brother Asahel to death in the battle at Gibeon.

---

## 2 Samuel 3:31

Then David said to Joab and to all the people who were with him,  
“Tear your clothes and put on sackcloth, and mourn before Abner.”  
And King David walked behind the bier.

## 2 Samuel 3:32

They buried Abner in Hebron;  
and the king raised his voice and wept at the grave of Abner,  
and all the people wept.

## 2 Samuel 3:33

And the king sang a song of mourning for Abner and said,

> “Should Abner die as a fool dies?

## 2 Samuel 3:34

> Your hands were not bound,  
> Nor your feet put in bronze shackles;  
> As one falls before the wicked, you have fallen.”  
> And all the people wept again over him.

## 2 Samuel 3:35

Then all the people came to provide food for David in his distress,  
but David vowed, saying,  
“May God do so to me, and more also,  
if I taste bread or anything else before the sun goes down.”

---

## 2 Samuel 3:36

All the people took note of it, and it pleased them,  
just as everything the king did pleased all the people.

## 2 Samuel 3:37

So all the people and all Israel understood on that day  
that it had not been the will of the king to put Abner the son of Ner to death.

## 2 Samuel 3:38

Then the king said to his servants,  
“Do you not know that a leader and a great man has fallen in Israel this day?

## 2 Samuel 3:39

And I am weak today, though anointed king;  
and these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too harsh for me.  
May the Lord repay the evildoer according to his evil.”
