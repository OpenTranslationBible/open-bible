# 2 Samuel Chapter 23

## 2 Samuel 23:1

Now these are the last words of David:  
David the son of Jesse declares,  
The man who was raised on high declares,  
The anointed of the God of Jacob,  
And the sweet psalmist of Israel:

## 2 Samuel 23:2

> “The Spirit of the Lord spoke through me,  
> And His word was on my tongue.

## 2 Samuel 23:3

> The God of Israel said,  
> The Rock of Israel spoke to me:  
> ‘He who rules over mankind righteously,  
> Who rules in the fear of God,

## 2 Samuel 23:4

> Is like the light of the morning when the sun rises,  
> A morning without clouds,  
> When the fresh grass springs out of the earth,  
> From sunshine after rain.’

## 2 Samuel 23:5

> Truly is not my house so with God?  
> For He has made an everlasting covenant with me,  
> Ordered and secured in all things;  
> For will He not indeed make all my salvation and all my desire grow?

## 2 Samuel 23:6

> But the worthless, every one of them will be thrust away like thorns,  
> Because they cannot be taken in hand;

## 2 Samuel 23:7

> But the man who touches them  
> Must be armed with iron and the shaft of a spear,  
> And they will be completely burned with fire in their place.”

## 2 Samuel 23:8

These are the names of the mighty men whom David had:  
Josheb-basshebeth, a Tahchemonite, chief of the captains—  
He wielded his spear against eight hundred whom he killed at one time.

## 2 Samuel 23:9

Next to him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the son of Ahohi,  
one of the three mighty men with David  
when they defied the Philistines who were gathered there for battle,  
and the men of Israel had withdrawn.

## 2 Samuel 23:10

He arose and struck the Philistines until his hand was weary and clung to the sword,  
and the Lord brought about a great victory that day;  
and the people returned after him only to strip the slain.

## 2 Samuel 23:11

Next to him was Shammah the son of Agee a Hararite.  
And the Philistines were gathered into a troop  
where there was a plot of ground full of lentils,  
and the people fled from the Philistines.

## 2 Samuel 23:12

But he took his stand in the midst of the plot and defended it,  
and struck the Philistines;  
and the Lord brought about a great victory.

## 2 Samuel 23:13

Then three of the thirty chief men went down and came to David at harvest time  
to the cave of Adullam,  
while the camp of the Philistines was in the Valley of Rephaim.

## 2 Samuel 23:14

David was then in the stronghold,  
and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.

## 2 Samuel 23:15

And David had a craving and said,  
“Oh that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem,  
which is by the gate!”

## 2 Samuel 23:16

So the three mighty men forced their way through the camp of the Philistines,  
and drew water from the well of Bethlehem which was by the gate,  
and took it and brought it to David.  
But he would not drink it, and poured it out as an offering to the Lord;

## 2 Samuel 23:17

And he said,  
“Far be it from me, Lord, that I would do this!  
Should I drink the blood of the men who went at the risk of their lives?”  
So he would not drink it.  
These things the three mighty men did.

## 2 Samuel 23:18

Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah,  
was chief of the thirty.  
And he wielded his spear against three hundred and killed them,  
and had a name as well as the three.

## 2 Samuel 23:19

He was the most honoured of the thirty,  
so he became their commander;  
but he did not attain to the three.

## 2 Samuel 23:20

Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada,  
a valiant warrior from Kabzeel,  
who had done mighty deeds,  
killed two sons of Ariel of Moab.  
He also went down and killed a lion in the middle of a pit on a snowy day.

## 2 Samuel 23:21

And he killed an impressive Egyptian.  
Now the Egyptian had a spear in his hand,  
but he went down to him with a staff,  
and snatched the spear from the Egyptian’s hand,  
and killed him with his own spear.

## 2 Samuel 23:22

These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did,  
and had a name as well as the three mighty men.

## 2 Samuel 23:23

He was honoured among the thirty,  
but he did not attain to the three.  
And David appointed him over his guard.
