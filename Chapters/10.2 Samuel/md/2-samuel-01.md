# 2 Samuel Chapter 1

## 2 Samuel 1:1

After the death of Saul, when David had returned from defeating the Amalekites, he stayed in Ziklag for two days.

## 2 Samuel 1:2

On the third day, a man came from Saul’s camp, his clothes torn and dust on his head. When he approached David, he fell to the ground in respect.

## 2 Samuel 1:3

David asked him, “Where have you come from?”  
He answered, “I have escaped from the Israelite camp.”

## 2 Samuel 1:4

David said, “What happened? Tell me.”  
He replied, “The troops fled from the battle; many fell and died. Saul and his son Jonathan are dead.”

## 2 Samuel 1:5

Then David asked the young man who brought him the report, “How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?”

## 2 Samuel 1:6

The young man answered, “I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and there was Saul, leaning on his spear, with the chariots and horsemen closing in on him.

## 2 Samuel 1:7

When he turned and saw me, he called to me, and I said, ‘Here I am.’

## 2 Samuel 1:8

He asked me, ‘Who are you?’  
I answered him, ‘I am an Amalekite.’

## 2 Samuel 1:9

Then he said, ‘Stand over me and finish me off, for I am in agony, yet still alive.’

## 2 Samuel 1:10

So I stood over him and killed him, because I knew that once he had fallen, he would not survive.  
Then I took the crown that was on his head and the armband from his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord.”

## 2 Samuel 1:11

Then David tore his clothes, and all the men with him did the same.

## 2 Samuel 1:12

They mourned, wept, and fasted until evening for Saul and his son Jonathan, and for the people of the Lord and the nation of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.

## 2 Samuel 1:13

David then asked the young man who had brought the report, “Where are you from?”  
He answered, “I am the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite.”

## 2 Samuel 1:14

David said to him, “How is it that you were not afraid to stretch out your hand to destroy the Lord’s anointed?”

## 2 Samuel 1:15

Then David called for one of his men and said, “Go and strike him down.”  
So he struck him, and the man died.

## 2 Samuel 1:16

David said to him, “Your blood is on your own head. Your own mouth testified against you when you said, ‘I killed the Lord’s anointed.’”

## 2 Samuel 1:17

Then David composed this lament for Saul and his son Jonathan,

## 2 Samuel 1:18

and he ordered that the people of Judah be taught this song of the bow — it is written in the Book of Jashar:

## 2 Samuel 1:19

> Your splendour, O Israel, lies slain upon your heights.  
> How the mighty have fallen!

## 2 Samuel 1:20

> Do not proclaim it in Gath,  
> Do not declare it in the streets of Ashkelon,  
> Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,  
> Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.

## 2 Samuel 1:21

> Mountains of Gilboa,  
> May no dew or rain fall upon you,  
> Nor fields yielding offerings,  
> For there the shield of the mighty was defiled,  
> The shield of Saul—no longer anointed with oil.

## 2 Samuel 1:22

> From the blood of the slain,  
> From the flesh of the mighty,  
> The bow of Jonathan did not turn back,  
> Nor did the sword of Saul return empty.

## 2 Samuel 1:23

> Saul and Jonathan—loved and admired in life,  
> And not divided in death.  
> They were swifter than eagles,  
> They were stronger than lions.

## 2 Samuel 1:24

> O daughters of Israel, weep for Saul,  
> Who clothed you in scarlet and finery,  
> Who adorned your garments with ornaments of gold.

## 2 Samuel 1:25

> How the mighty have fallen in battle!  
> Jonathan lies slain on your heights.

## 2 Samuel 1:26

> I grieve for you, Jonathan my brother;  
> You were very dear to me.  
> Your love for me was more wonderful  
> Than the love of women.

## 2 Samuel 1:27

> How the mighty have fallen!  
> The weapons of war are lost!
