## Deuteronomy 29:10

You are all standing today before the Lord your God—your leaders, your tribes, your elders, and your officers, all the men of Israel,

## Deuteronomy 29:11

your children, your wives, and the foreigner who is in your camp, from the one who chops your wood to the one who draws your water—

## Deuteronomy 29:12

that you may enter into the covenant of the Lord your God, and into His oath, which the Lord your God is making with you today,

## Deuteronomy 29:13

so that He may establish you today as His people, and that He may be your God, as He promised you and as He swore to your ancestors, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.

You know how we dwelt in the land of Egypt and how we passed through the nations you encountered.

## Deuteronomy 29:17

You saw their detestable things, their idols of wood and stone, of silver and gold, which were among them.

## Deuteronomy 29:18

Beware lest there be among you a man or woman, clan or tribe, whose heart turns away today from the Lord our God to serve the gods of those nations; lest there be among you a root bearing poisonous and bitter fruit.

## Deuteronomy 29:19

When such a person hears the words of this oath, he may bless himself in his heart, saying, ‘I shall have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart,’ thus bringing disaster on the watered land as well as the dry.

The Lord will not spare him; the anger and jealousy of the Lord will burn against that person. Every curse written in this book will fall upon him, and the Lord will blot out his name from under heaven.

The Lord will set him apart for calamity from all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant written in this book of the law.

The generation to come, your children who rise up after you, and the foreigner who comes from a distant land, will see the plagues of the land and the diseases with which the Lord has afflicted it, and they will say,

## Deuteronomy 29:23

The whole land is sulphur and salt, a burning waste, unsown and unproductive, with no plant growing on it,

> like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which the Lord overthrew in His anger and wrath.

## Deuteronomy 29:24

All the nations will say, ‘Why has the Lord done this to this land? Why this great burning anger?’

## Deuteronomy 29:25

Then people will answer, ‘Because they abandoned the covenant of the Lord, the God of their ancestors, which He made with them when He brought them out of Egypt.

They went and served other gods and worshipped them, gods they did not know and that He had not given to them.

So the anger of the Lord burned against this land, bringing upon it every curse written in this book.

## Deuteronomy 29:28

The Lord uprooted them from their land in anger, wrath, and great indignation, and cast them into another land, as it is this day.’
