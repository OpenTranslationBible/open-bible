## Deuteronomy 22:13

If a man marries a woman and after being with her, dislikes her,

## Deuteronomy 22:14

and accuses her of shameful conduct and gives her a bad name, saying, 'I married this woman, but when I approached her, I did not find proof of her virginity,'

## Deuteronomy 22:15

then the woman’s father and mother shall bring proof of her virginity to the elders at the city gate.

## Deuteronomy 22:16

The father shall say to the elders, 'I gave my daughter to this man to be his wife, but he now rejects her.'

## Deuteronomy 22:17

'He has accused her of disgraceful conduct, saying he found no proof of her virginity. But here is the evidence.' Then they shall spread out the cloth before the elders.

## Deuteronomy 22:18

The elders shall take the man and punish him.

## Deuteronomy 22:19

They shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver and give them to the woman’s father, because he has given a virgin of Israel a bad name. She shall remain his wife; he may not divorce her for the rest of his life.

## Deuteronomy 22:20

But if the accusation is true and no evidence of the young woman’s virginity is found,

## Deuteronomy 22:21

she shall be brought to the door of her father’s house, and the men of her town shall stone her to death, because she has committed a disgraceful act in Israel by being promiscuous while in her father’s house. In this way, you shall purge the evil from among you.

## Deuteronomy 22:22

If a man is found lying with another man’s wife, both the man and the woman must die. You must remove the evil from Israel.

## Deuteronomy 22:23

If a virgin is pledged to be married and a man meets her in a town and lies with her,

## Deuteronomy 22:24

you shall take both of them to the gate of that town and stone them to death—the woman because she did not scream for help though she was in town, and the man because he violated another man’s wife. You must purge the evil from among you.

## Deuteronomy 22:25

But if a man meets a betrothed woman in the countryside and forces her to lie with him, only the man shall die.

## Deuteronomy 22:26

Do nothing to the woman; she has committed no sin deserving death. This case is like someone who attacks and murders a neighbour.

## Deuteronomy 22:27

Since the man found her in the country, and though the betrothed woman screamed, there was no one to rescue her.

## Deuteronomy 22:28

If a man meets a virgin who is not pledged to be married and forces himself on her, and they are discovered,

## Deuteronomy 22:29

he must pay the woman’s father fifty shekels of silver. He must marry her, and he may not divorce her as long as he lives.

## Deuteronomy 22:30

A man must not marry his father’s wife, nor dishonour his father’s marriage bed.
