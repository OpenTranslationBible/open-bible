# Deuteronomy Chapter 3

## Deuteronomy 3:1
Then we turned and went up the road to Bashan, and Og king of Bashan came out against us with all his people to fight at Edrei.

## Deuteronomy 3:2
But the Lord said to me, ‘Do not fear him, for I have handed him over to you, along with all his people and his land. Do to him what you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon.’

## Deuteronomy 3:3
So the Lord our God delivered Og king of Bashan and all his people into our hands, and we struck them down until no one was left alive.

## Deuteronomy 3:4
We captured all his cities—sixty in total, the whole region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.

## Deuteronomy 3:5
All these cities were fortified with high walls and gates and bars, in addition to a great many unwalled towns.

## Deuteronomy 3:6
We devoted them to destruction, as we had done with Sihon king of Heshbon—every city, men, women, and children.

## Deuteronomy 3:7
But we kept the livestock and plunder from the cities for ourselves.

## Deuteronomy 3:8
So at that time we took from the two Amorite kings the territory east of the Jordan, from the Arnon Gorge to Mount Hermon

## Deuteronomy 3:9
(The Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir.)

## Deuteronomy 3:10
We took all the towns on the plateau and all Gilead and all Bashan as far as Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og.

## Deuteronomy 3:11
Og king of Bashan was the last of the Rephaim. His bed, made of iron, was over thirteen feet long and six feet wide. It is still in Rabbah of the Ammonites.

## Deuteronomy 3:12
At that time we took possession of the land. I gave to the Reubenites and Gadites the area extending from Aroer near the Arnon Gorge to half the hill country of Gilead, including its towns.

## Deuteronomy 3:13
The rest of Gilead and all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh—all the region of Argob, all that territory of Bashan. It was once called the land of the Rephaim.

## Deuteronomy 3:14
Jair son of Manasseh took the whole region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites and named it Havvoth Jair, and that name remains to this day.

## Deuteronomy 3:15
To Makir I gave Gilead.

## Deuteronomy 3:16
To the Reubenites and Gadites I gave the area from Gilead to the Arnon Gorge, including the valley and the border with Ammon,

## Deuteronomy 3:17
as well as the Arabah, with the Jordan as its border from Kinnereth to the Sea of the Arabah (the Salt Sea), below the slopes of Pisgah.

## Deuteronomy 3:18
At that time I gave you this command: ‘The Lord your God has given you this land to possess. But all your warriors, equipped for battle, must cross over ahead of your fellow Israelites.

## Deuteronomy 3:19
Only your wives, children, and livestock—I know you have much livestock—may remain in the towns I have given you.

## Deuteronomy 3:20
When the Lord gives rest to your brothers as He has to you, and they also possess the land across the Jordan, then each of you may return to your inheritance I have given you.’

## Deuteronomy 3:21
At that time I commanded Joshua: ‘You have seen with your own eyes everything the Lord your God has done to these two kings. The Lord will do the same to all the kingdoms you now face.

## Deuteronomy 3:22
Do not be afraid of them, for the Lord your God Himself fights for you.’

## Deuteronomy 3:23
At that time I pleaded with the Lord:

## Deuteronomy 3:24
‘Lord God, You have begun to show Your servant Your greatness and Your strong hand. What god is there in heaven or on earth who can do the works and mighty acts You do?

## Deuteronomy 3:25
Let me go over and see the good land across the Jordan—the beautiful hill country and Lebanon.’

## Deuteronomy 3:26
But the Lord was angry with me because of you and would not listen. He said, ‘That is enough; do not speak to Me again about this matter.

## Deuteronomy 3:27
Go up to the top of Pisgah and look west, north, south, and east. Look at the land with your eyes, for you will not cross the Jordan.

## Deuteronomy 3:28
But commission Joshua and encourage and strengthen him, for he will lead the people across and cause them to inherit the land that you will see.’

## Deuteronomy 3:29
So we remained in the valley opposite Beth Peor.
