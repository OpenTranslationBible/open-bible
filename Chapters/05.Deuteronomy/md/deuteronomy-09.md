# Deuteronomy Chapter 9

## Deuteronomy 9:1
Hear, O Israel: You are about to cross the Jordan today to enter and dispossess nations greater and stronger than you, with large cities fortified up to the heavens.

## Deuteronomy 9:2
The people are strong and tall—the Anakim. You know about them, and you have heard it said, ‘Who can stand up to the descendants of Anak?’

## Deuteronomy 9:3
But understand today that the Lord your God goes before you as a consuming fire. He will destroy them and subdue them before you. So you shall drive them out and annihilate them swiftly, as the Lord has promised.

## Deuteronomy 9:4
When the Lord your God has driven them out before you, do not say in your heart, ‘It is because of my righteousness that the Lord has brought me in to possess this land.’ Rather, it is because of the wickedness of these nations that the Lord is dispossessing them before you.

## Deuteronomy 9:5
It is not because of your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart that you are going in to possess their land. Instead, it is because of their wickedness that the Lord your God is driving them out before you, to confirm the promise He made to your ancestors—to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

## Deuteronomy 9:6
Know, therefore, that it is not on account of your righteousness that the Lord your God is giving you this good land to possess—for you are a stiff-necked people.

## Deuteronomy 9:7
Remember and do not forget how you provoked the Lord your God to anger in the wilderness. From the day you left Egypt until you arrived here, you have been rebellious toward the Lord.

## Deuteronomy 9:8
At Horeb you aroused the Lord’s anger so that He was ready to destroy you.

## Deuteronomy 9:9
When I went up the mountain to receive the stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant the Lord made with you, I remained on the mountain forty days and forty nights. I ate no bread and drank no water.

## Deuteronomy 9:10
The Lord gave me two stone tablets written with His own finger. On them were all the words the Lord had spoken to you from the fire on the mountain on the day of the assembly.

## Deuteronomy 9:11
At the end of forty days and forty nights, the Lord gave me the two stone tablets—the tablets of the covenant.

## Deuteronomy 9:12
Then the Lord said to me, ‘Get up and go down quickly from here, for your people whom you brought out of Egypt have corrupted themselves. They have quickly turned aside from the way I commanded them and have made for themselves an idol.’

## Deuteronomy 9:13
And the Lord said, ‘I have seen this people, and they are indeed a stubborn people.

## Deuteronomy 9:14
Leave Me alone, so that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven. Then I will make you into a nation stronger and more numerous than they.’

## Deuteronomy 9:15
So I turned and came down the mountain while it was ablaze with fire, with the two tablets of the covenant in my hands.

## Deuteronomy 9:16
And I saw that you had sinned against the Lord your God; you had made for yourselves a calf idol. You had quickly turned aside from the way the Lord commanded you.

## Deuteronomy 9:17
So I took the two tablets and threw them out of my hands, breaking them before your eyes.

## Deuteronomy 9:18
Then I lay face down before the Lord for forty days and forty nights, as I had done the first time. I did not eat bread or drink water because of all the sin you had committed, doing what was evil in the Lord’s sight and provoking Him to anger.

## Deuteronomy 9:19
I was afraid of the fierce anger of the Lord, who was so angry with you He was ready to destroy you. But the Lord listened to me that time also.

## Deuteronomy 9:20
The Lord was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him, but I prayed for Aaron at that time too.

## Deuteronomy 9:21
Then I took that sinful thing you had made—the calf—and burned it in the fire, crushed it and ground it to powder as fine as dust, and threw the dust into the stream that flows down from the mountain.

## Deuteronomy 9:22
You also provoked the Lord at Taberah, at Massah, and at Kibroth Hattaavah.

## Deuteronomy 9:23
And when the Lord sent you from Kadesh Barnea saying, ‘Go up and take possession of the land I have given you,’ you rebelled against the command of the Lord your God. You neither trusted Him nor obeyed Him.

## Deuteronomy 9:24
You have been rebellious against the Lord from the day I first knew you.

## Deuteronomy 9:25
So I lay prostrate before the Lord those forty days and forty nights because the Lord had said He would destroy you.

## Deuteronomy 9:26
I prayed to the Lord and said, ‘Lord God, do not destroy Your people, Your inheritance, whom You redeemed through Your greatness and brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand.

## Deuteronomy 9:27
Remember Your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Do not look on the stubbornness of this people, or on their wickedness and sin.

## Deuteronomy 9:28
Otherwise, the land from which You brought us will say, “Because the Lord was not able to bring them into the land He promised, and because He hated them, He brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.”

## Deuteronomy 9:29
Yet they are Your people—Your inheritance—whom You brought out by Your great power and outstretched arm.
