# Deuteronomy Chapter 19

## Deuteronomy 19:1
When the Lord your God has destroyed the nations whose land He is giving you, and when you have taken possession of it and settled in their towns and homes,

## Deuteronomy 19:2
then you shall set apart three cities for yourself in the land the Lord your God is giving you to possess.

## Deuteronomy 19:3
Prepare the roads and divide into three parts the territory the Lord your God is giving you, so that anyone who kills another unintentionally may flee there.

## Deuteronomy 19:4
Now this is the case of the person who may flee to one of these cities and live: one who kills their neighbour unintentionally, without prior hatred—

## Deuteronomy 19:5
for example, someone goes into the forest with a neighbour to cut wood, and as they swing the axe, the head slips from the handle and strikes the other person and kills them—such a person may flee to one of these cities and live.

## Deuteronomy 19:6
Otherwise, the avenger of blood might pursue and overtake the one fleeing, if the distance is too great, and kill them, even though they were not deserving of death, since they had not hated their neighbour previously.

## Deuteronomy 19:7
Therefore, I command you to set apart three cities.

## Deuteronomy 19:8
And if the Lord your God enlarges your territory, as He swore to your ancestors, and gives you all the land He promised to give them—

## Deuteronomy 19:9
because you carefully keep all these commands I am giving you today—to love the Lord your God and to walk always in His ways—then you shall add three more cities to these three.

## Deuteronomy 19:10
Do this so that innocent blood will not be shed in your land, and so that you will not be guilty of bloodshed.

## Deuteronomy 19:11
But if a man hates his neighbour, lies in wait for him, rises up against him and strikes him fatally so that he dies, and then flees to one of these cities,

## Deuteronomy 19:12
the elders of his city must send for him, bring him back from there, and hand him over to the avenger of blood, so that he may die.

## Deuteronomy 19:13
Show no pity. You must purge from Israel the guilt of shedding innocent blood, so that it may go well with you.

## Deuteronomy 19:14
Do not move your neighbour’s boundary stone set up by your ancestors in the inheritance you receive in the land the Lord your God is giving you.

## Deuteronomy 19:15
A single witness is not sufficient to convict someone of any crime or offence. A matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.

## Deuteronomy 19:16
If a malicious witness arises to accuse someone falsely,

## Deuteronomy 19:17
the two parties involved in the dispute must stand before the Lord, before the priests and the judges who are in office at that time.

## Deuteronomy 19:18
The judges must make a thorough investigation, and if the witness is shown to be lying, having given false testimony against another,

## Deuteronomy 19:19
then you must do to the false witness what they intended to do to the other party. You must purge the evil from among you.

## Deuteronomy 19:20
The rest of the people will hear and be afraid, and never again will such an evil thing be done among you.

## Deuteronomy 19:21
You must show no pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
