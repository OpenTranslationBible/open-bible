# Deuteronomy Chapter 5

## Deuteronomy 5:1
Moses summoned all Israel and said to them: “Hear, O Israel, the statutes and ordinances I am proclaiming to you today. Learn them and be sure to follow them.

## Deuteronomy 5:2
The Lord our God made a covenant with us at Horeb.

## Deuteronomy 5:3
It was not with our ancestors alone that the Lord made this covenant, but with all of us who are alive here today.

## Deuteronomy 5:4
The Lord spoke to you face to face out of the fire on the mountain.

## Deuteronomy 5:5
At that time I stood between the Lord and you to declare His word to you, for you were afraid of the fire and did not go up the mountain. And He said:

## Deuteronomy 5:6
‘I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.

## Deuteronomy 5:7
You shall have no other gods besides Me.

## Deuteronomy 5:8
You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in the heavens above, or on the earth below, or in the waters beneath.

## Deuteronomy 5:9
You shall not bow down to them or serve them; for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sins of the parents to the third and fourth generation of those who hate Me,

## Deuteronomy 5:10
but showing steadfast love to thousands of those who love Me and keep My commandments.

## Deuteronomy 5:11
You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God, for the Lord will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses His name.

## Deuteronomy 5:12
Observe the Sabbath day by keeping it holy, as the Lord your God has commanded you.

## Deuteronomy 5:13
Six days you shall labour and do all your work,

## Deuteronomy 5:14
but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work—neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your male or female servant, nor your ox, donkey, or any of your animals, nor any foreigner residing in your towns—so that your male and female servants may rest, as you do.

## Deuteronomy 5:15
Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the Lord your God brought you out of there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. Therefore the Lord your God commands you to keep the Sabbath day.

## Deuteronomy 5:16
Honour your father and your mother, as the Lord your God has commanded you, so that you may live long and that it may go well with you in the land the Lord your God is giving you.

## Deuteronomy 5:17
You shall not murder.

## Deuteronomy 5:18
You shall not commit adultery.

## Deuteronomy 5:19
You shall not steal.

## Deuteronomy 5:20
You shall not give false testimony against your neighbour.

## Deuteronomy 5:21
You shall not covet your neighbour’s wife. You shall not desire your neighbour’s house, field, servant, ox, donkey, or anything else that belongs to your neighbour.

## Deuteronomy 5:22
These are the commandments the Lord proclaimed in a loud voice to your entire assembly there on the mountain from out of the fire, the cloud, and the deep darkness. He added nothing more. Then He wrote them on two stone tablets and gave them to me.

## Deuteronomy 5:23
When you heard the voice out of the darkness, while the mountain was ablaze with fire, all your tribal leaders and elders came to me.

## Deuteronomy 5:24
And you said, ‘The Lord our God has shown us His glory and greatness, and we have heard His voice from the fire. Today we have seen that a person can live even if God speaks with them.

## Deuteronomy 5:25
But now, why should we die? If we keep hearing the voice of the Lord our God, we will surely die.

## Deuteronomy 5:26
For who among all flesh has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of fire, as we have, and lived?

## Deuteronomy 5:27
Go near and listen to all that the Lord our God says. Then tell us whatever the Lord our God tells you. We will listen and obey.’

## Deuteronomy 5:28
The Lord heard what you said, and He said to me, ‘I have heard the words of this people, and they are right in all that they have spoken.

## Deuteronomy 5:29
If only their hearts would always be inclined to fear Me and to keep all My commands, so that it might go well with them and their children forever!

## Deuteronomy 5:30
Go, tell them: “Return to your tents.”

## Deuteronomy 5:31
But as for you, stay here with Me so that I may give you all the commands, decrees, and laws you are to teach them to follow in the land I am giving them to possess.’

## Deuteronomy 5:32
So be careful to do what the Lord your God has commanded you; do not turn aside to the right or to the left.

## Deuteronomy 5:33
Walk in obedience to all that the Lord your God has commanded you, so that you may live and prosper and prolong your days in the land you will possess.
