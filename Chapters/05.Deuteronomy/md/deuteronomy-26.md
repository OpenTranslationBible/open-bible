# Deuteronomy Chapter 26

## Deuteronomy 26:1
When you enter the land the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance, and take possession of it and live in it,

## Deuteronomy 26:2
You must take some of the first of all the produce from the soil of the land the Lord your God is giving you, put it in a basket, and go to the place the Lord your God will choose for His name to dwell.

## Deuteronomy 26:3
Go to the priest who is in office at that time and say to him, 'I declare today to the Lord your God that I have come to the land the Lord swore to our ancestors to give us.'

## Deuteronomy 26:4
Then the priest shall take the basket from your hand and place it before the altar of the Lord your God.

## Deuteronomy 26:5
Then you shall say before the Lord your God:
'My father was a wandering Aramean,
> He went down to Egypt and lived there as a foreigner, few in number,
> But there he became a great, powerful, and numerous nation.'

## Deuteronomy 26:6
'But the Egyptians mistreated us and afflicted us,
> And laid hard labour upon us.'

## Deuteronomy 26:7
'Then we cried out to the Lord, the God of our ancestors,
> And the Lord heard our voice and saw our hardship, toil, and oppression.'

## Deuteronomy 26:8
So the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, with great terror, signs, and wonders.

## Deuteronomy 26:9
He brought us to this place and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey.

## Deuteronomy 26:10
And now, I bring the firstfruits of the soil that You, O Lord, have given me. Then set it before the Lord your God and bow down before Him.

## Deuteronomy 26:11
You, the Levite, and the foreigner residing among you shall rejoice in all the good things the Lord your God has given to you and your household.

## Deuteronomy 26:12
When you have finished setting aside a tenth of all your produce in the third year, the year of the tithe, and given it to the Levite, the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow, so that they may eat in your towns and be satisfied,

## Deuteronomy 26:13
Then say to the Lord your God, 'I have removed from my house the sacred portion and have given it to the Levite, the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow, just as You commanded. I have not turned aside from any of Your commands, nor have I forgotten them.'

## Deuteronomy 26:14
'I have not eaten any of the tithe while in mourning,
> Nor removed any of it while unclean,
> Nor offered any of it to the dead.
I have obeyed the Lord my God and have done everything You commanded me.'

## Deuteronomy 26:15
Look down from Your holy dwelling, from heaven, and bless Your people Israel and the land You have given us, as You swore to our ancestorsâ€”a land flowing with milk and honey.

He will set you high above all the nations He has made, in praise, fame, and honour, and you will be a holy people to the Lord your God, as He has spoken.
