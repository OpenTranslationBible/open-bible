# Deuteronomy Chapter 4

## Deuteronomy 4:1
Now, Israel, listen to the statutes and judgments I am teaching you to observe, so that you may live and enter and possess the land the Lord, the God of your ancestors, is giving you.

## Deuteronomy 4:2
Do not add to what I command you or subtract from it, but keep the commands of the Lord your God that I give you.

## Deuteronomy 4:3
Your eyes have seen what the Lord did at Baal Peor. The Lord your God destroyed from among you everyone who followed the Baal of Peor.

## Deuteronomy 4:4
But all of you who held fast to the Lord your God are alive today.

## Deuteronomy 4:5
See, I have taught you statutes and judgments, as the Lord my God commanded me, that you may follow them in the land you are entering to possess.

## Deuteronomy 4:6
Keep them and do them, for this will show your wisdom and understanding to the nations, who will hear of these laws and say, ‘Surely this great nation is wise and understanding.’

## Deuteronomy 4:7
For what great nation has a god so near to them as the Lord our God is whenever we call on Him?

## Deuteronomy 4:8
And what great nation has righteous statutes and judgments like this entire law I am setting before you today?

## Deuteronomy 4:9
Only be careful and watch yourselves closely so that you do not forget the things your eyes have seen or let them fade from your heart as long as you live. Teach them to your children and grandchildren.

## Deuteronomy 4:10
Remember the day you stood before the Lord your God at Horeb, when He said, ‘Assemble the people before Me so that they may hear My words and learn to fear Me all the days they live on the earth, and so they may teach them to their children.’

## Deuteronomy 4:11
You came near and stood at the foot of the mountain while it blazed with fire to the heavens, with darkness, cloud, and thick gloom.

## Deuteronomy 4:12
Then the Lord spoke to you out of the fire. You heard the sound of words but saw no form; there was only a voice.

## Deuteronomy 4:13
He declared to you His covenant, the Ten Commandments, which He commanded you to follow, and He wrote them on two stone tablets.

## Deuteronomy 4:14
At that time the Lord directed me to teach you statutes and judgments to follow in the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess.

## Deuteronomy 4:15
Watch yourselves closely, since you saw no form on the day the Lord spoke to you at Horeb out of the fire.

## Deuteronomy 4:16
Do not corrupt yourselves by making an idol, in the form of any figure—whether man or woman,

## Deuteronomy 4:17
or an animal on the earth, or a bird that flies in the sky,

## Deuteronomy 4:18
or any creature that moves on the ground, or any fish in the waters below.

## Deuteronomy 4:19
And when you look to the heavens and see the sun, moon, and stars—all the heavenly array—do not be drawn away into bowing down to them or worshiping them. These the Lord your God has allotted to all nations under heaven.

## Deuteronomy 4:20
But the Lord took you and brought you out of the iron furnace of Egypt to be His own people, as you are today.

## Deuteronomy 4:21
The Lord was angry with me because of you and solemnly swore that I would not cross the Jordan or enter the good land the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance.

## Deuteronomy 4:22
I will die in this land; I will not cross the Jordan, but you will cross and take possession of that good land.

## Deuteronomy 4:23
Be careful not to forget the covenant the Lord your God made with you; do not make for yourselves an idol in the form of anything the Lord your God has forbidden.

## Deuteronomy 4:24
For the Lord your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.

## Deuteronomy 4:25
After you have had children and grandchildren and have lived in the land a long time, if you then become corrupt and make an idol, doing evil in the sight of the Lord, provoking Him to anger—

## Deuteronomy 4:26
I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you today that you will quickly perish from the land you are crossing the Jordan to possess. You will not live long there but will be utterly destroyed.

## Deuteronomy 4:27
The Lord will scatter you among the peoples, and only a few of you will survive among the nations where the Lord will drive you.

## Deuteronomy 4:28
There you will worship man-made gods of wood and stone, which cannot see or hear or eat or smell.

## Deuteronomy 4:29
But if from there you seek the Lord your God, you will find Him if you seek Him with all your heart and soul.

## Deuteronomy 4:30
In your distress, when all these things have happened to you in later days, you will return to the Lord your God and obey His voice.

## Deuteronomy 4:31
For the Lord your God is merciful; He will not abandon or destroy you or forget the covenant with your ancestors.

## Deuteronomy 4:32
Ask now about former days, before your time, from the day God created humanity on the earth: has anything as great as this ever happened? Has anything like it been heard?

## Deuteronomy 4:33
Has any other people heard the voice of God speaking from the midst of the fire, as you have, and lived?

## Deuteronomy 4:34
Or has any god ever attempted to take a nation from the midst of another nation by trials, signs, wonders, war, and mighty acts, as the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?

## Deuteronomy 4:35
You were shown these things so that you would know that the Lord is God; there is no other besides Him.

## Deuteronomy 4:36
From heaven He let you hear His voice to discipline you. On earth He showed you His great fire, and you heard His words from within the fire.

## Deuteronomy 4:37
Because He loved your ancestors, He chose their descendants and brought you out of Egypt by His presence and great power,

## Deuteronomy 4:38
to drive out before you nations greater and stronger than you, and to bring you into their land to give it to you as an inheritance, as it is today.

## Deuteronomy 4:39
Acknowledge and take to heart that the Lord is God in heaven above and on the earth below. There is no other.

## Deuteronomy 4:40
Keep His statutes and commandments, so that it may go well with you and your children after you, and you may live long in the land the Lord your God is giving you for all time.

## Deuteronomy 4:41
Then Moses set apart three cities east of the Jordan,

## Deuteronomy 4:42
to which a person who killed someone unintentionally, without prior malice, could flee for refuge and save their life:

## Deuteronomy 4:43
Bezer in the wilderness plateau for the Reubenites, Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan for the Manassites.

## Deuteronomy 4:44
This is the law Moses set before the Israelites:

## Deuteronomy 4:45
These are the statutes, decrees, and ordinances Moses proclaimed to the Israelites after they came out of Egypt,

## Deuteronomy 4:46
in the valley near Beth Peor, east of the Jordan, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who had ruled in Heshbon and was defeated by Moses and the Israelites after they came out of Egypt.

## Deuteronomy 4:47
They took possession of his land and the territory of Og king of Bashan—two Amorite kings east of the Jordan.

## Deuteronomy 4:48
This land extended from Aroer, near the Arnon Gorge, to Mount Sion (that is, Hermon),

## Deuteronomy 4:49
and included all the Arabah east of the Jordan, as far as the Sea of the Arabah, below the slopes of Pisgah.
