# Deuteronomy Chapter 12

## Deuteronomy 12:1
These are the statutes and laws you must be careful to follow in the land the Lord, the God of your ancestors, is giving you to possess all the days you live on the earth.

## Deuteronomy 12:2
You must completely destroy all the places where the nations you dispossess worshipped their gods—on high mountains, on hills, and under every leafy tree.

## Deuteronomy 12:3
Tear down their altars, smash their pillars, burn their Asherah poles, and cut down the carved images of their gods. Wipe out their names from those places.

## Deuteronomy 12:4
You must not worship the Lord your God in such ways.

## Deuteronomy 12:5
Instead, you must seek the place the Lord your God will choose from among all your tribes to put His name and make His dwelling. You are to go there.

## Deuteronomy 12:6
To that place you are to bring your burnt offerings, sacrifices, tithes, special gifts, vow offerings, freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks.

## Deuteronomy 12:7
There, in the presence of the Lord your God, you and your households shall eat and rejoice in all you have accomplished, because the Lord your God has blessed you.

## Deuteronomy 12:8
You are not to do as we are doing here today—each person doing what is right in their own eyes—

## Deuteronomy 12:9
because you have not yet arrived at the resting place and inheritance the Lord your God is giving you.

## Deuteronomy 12:10
But when you cross the Jordan and live in the land the Lord your God is giving you, and He gives you rest from all your enemies, so that you live in safety,

## Deuteronomy 12:11
then to the place the Lord your God chooses as a dwelling for His Name, you are to bring everything I command you—your burnt offerings, sacrifices, tithes, contributions, and choice offerings vowed to the Lord.

## Deuteronomy 12:12
And you shall rejoice before the Lord your God—you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levite within your gates, since he has no portion or inheritance among you.

## Deuteronomy 12:13
Be careful not to offer your burnt offerings in just any place you see.

## Deuteronomy 12:14
Offer them only in the place the Lord will choose in one of your tribes. There you shall do everything I command you.

## Deuteronomy 12:15
However, you may slaughter and eat meat within any of your towns as much as you desire, according to the blessing the Lord your God has given you. Both the ceremonially clean and unclean may eat it, as they would gazelle or deer.

## Deuteronomy 12:16
But you must not eat the blood; pour it on the ground like water.

## Deuteronomy 12:17
You must not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain, new wine, oil, or the firstborn of your herds and flocks, or any of your vow offerings, freewill offerings, or special gifts.

## Deuteronomy 12:18
You are to eat them before the Lord your God at the place He chooses—you, your children, your servants, and the Levites—and rejoice in everything you undertake, because the Lord your God has blessed you.

## Deuteronomy 12:19
Be careful not to neglect the Levite as long as you live in your land.

## Deuteronomy 12:20
When the Lord your God enlarges your territory, as He promised, and you desire to eat meat, you may do so wherever you live.

## Deuteronomy 12:21
If the place the Lord your God chooses is too far away, you may slaughter animals from the herds and flocks the Lord has given you and eat them in your towns, as I have commanded.

## Deuteronomy 12:22
Eat it as you would gazelle or deer—both the clean and unclean may eat it.

## Deuteronomy 12:23
But be sure not to eat the blood, because the blood is the life, and you must not consume the life with the meat.

## Deuteronomy 12:24
Do not eat it; pour it out on the ground like water.

## Deuteronomy 12:25
Do not eat it, so that it may go well with you and your descendants, because you will be doing what is right in the Lord’s sight.

## Deuteronomy 12:26
But the holy things you have and your vow offerings must be taken to the place the Lord will choose.

## Deuteronomy 12:27
Offer your burnt offerings—both meat and blood—on the altar of the Lord your God. The blood of your sacrifices must be poured beside the altar, but you may eat the meat.

## Deuteronomy 12:28
Be careful to obey all these commands I give you, so that it may go well with you and your children after you, because you will be doing what is good and right in the eyes of the Lord your God.

## Deuteronomy 12:29
When the Lord your God cuts off before you the nations you are dispossessing, and you settle in their land,

## Deuteronomy 12:30
be careful not to be ensnared by their ways after they are destroyed before you. Do not inquire about their gods, saying, ‘How did these nations serve their gods? I will do the same.’

## Deuteronomy 12:31
You must not worship the Lord your God in that way, for they perform for their gods every detestable act the Lord hates. They even burn their sons and daughters in fire to their gods.

## Deuteronomy 12:32
Be sure to do everything I command you. Do not add to it or take away from it.
