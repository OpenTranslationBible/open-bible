# Ezekiel Chapter 20

## Ezekiel 20:1

Now in the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth of the month, men from the elders of Israel came to inquire of the Lord, and they sat before me.

## Ezekiel 20:2

And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,

## Ezekiel 20:3

“Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel and say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says: Do you come to inquire of Me? As I live,’ declares the Lord God, ‘I certainly will not be inquired of by you.’

## Ezekiel 20:4

Will you judge them, will you judge them, son of man? Make them know the abominations of their fathers.

## Ezekiel 20:5

And say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says: On the day when I chose Israel and swore to the descendants of the house of Jacob and made Myself known to them in the land of Egypt, when I swore to them, saying, “I am the Lord your God,”

## Ezekiel 20:6

On that day I swore to them, to bring them out from the land of Egypt into a land that I had selected for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands.

## Ezekiel 20:7

And I said to them, “Each of you, throw away the detestable things of his eyes, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am the Lord your God.”

## Ezekiel 20:8

But they rebelled against Me and were not willing to listen to Me; none of them threw away the detestable things of their eyes, nor did they abandon the idols of Egypt.  
Then I resolved to pour out My wrath on them, to use up My anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.

## Ezekiel 20:9

But I acted for the sake of My name, that it would not be defiled in the eyes of the nations among whom they lived, in whose sight I made Myself known to them by bringing them out of the land of Egypt.

## Ezekiel 20:10

So I took them out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness.

## Ezekiel 20:11

And I gave them My statutes and informed them of My ordinances, which, if a person follows, then he will live by them.

## Ezekiel 20:12

Also I gave them My Sabbaths to be a sign between Me and them, so that they would know that I am the Lord who sanctifies them.

## Ezekiel 20:13

But the house of Israel rebelled against Me in the wilderness. They did not walk in My statutes, and they rejected My ordinances which, if a person follows, then he will live by them; and they greatly profaned My Sabbaths.  
Then I resolved to pour out My wrath on them in the wilderness, to annihilate them.

## Ezekiel 20:14

But I acted for the sake of My name, so that it would not be defiled in the sight of the nations before whose eyes I had brought them out.

## Ezekiel 20:15

Also I swore to them in the wilderness that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands,

## Ezekiel 20:16

Because they rejected My ordinances, and as for My statutes, they did not walk in them; they also profaned My Sabbaths, because their heart continually followed their idols.

## Ezekiel 20:17

Yet My eye spared them instead of destroying them, and I did not bring about their annihilation in the wilderness.

## Ezekiel 20:18

Instead, I said to their children in the wilderness, “Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers or keep their ordinances or defile yourselves with their idols.

## Ezekiel 20:19

I am the Lord your God; walk in My statutes and keep My ordinances and follow them.

## Ezekiel 20:20

Sanctify My Sabbaths, and they shall be a sign between Me and you, so that you may know that I am the Lord your God.”

## Ezekiel 20:21

But the children rebelled against Me; they did not walk in My statutes, nor were they careful to follow My ordinances, by which, if a person follows them, he will live; they profaned My Sabbaths. So I resolved to pour out My wrath on them, to use up My anger against them in the wilderness.

## Ezekiel 20:22

But I withdrew My hand and acted for the sake of My name, so that it would not be profaned in the sight of the nations, before whose eyes I had brought them out.

## Ezekiel 20:23

Also I swore to them in the wilderness that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them among the lands,

## Ezekiel 20:24

Because they had not practiced My ordinances, but had rejected My statutes and profaned My Sabbaths, and their eyes were on the idols of their fathers.

## Ezekiel 20:25

I also gave them statutes that were not good, and ordinances by which they could not live;

## Ezekiel 20:26

And I pronounced them unclean because of their gifts, in that they made all their firstborn pass through the fire, so that I might make them desolate, in order that they might know that I am the Lord.”’

## Ezekiel 20:27

“Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel and say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says: Again, in this your fathers have blasphemed Me by being disloyal to Me.

## Ezekiel 20:28

When I had brought them into the land which I swore to give them, they saw every high hill and every leafy tree, and there they offered their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offerings. There also they made their soothing aroma and poured out their drink offerings.

## Ezekiel 20:29

Then I said to them, “What is the high place to which you go?” So its name is called Bamah to this day.”’

## Ezekiel 20:30

Therefore say to the house of Israel, ‘This is what the Lord God says: Will you defile yourselves in the way of your fathers and adulterously pursue their detestable things?

## Ezekiel 20:31

When you offer your gifts, when you make your sons pass through the fire, you are defiling yourselves with all your idols to this day. And shall I be inquired of by you, house of Israel? As I live,’ declares the Lord God, ‘I certainly will not be inquired of by you.

## Ezekiel 20:32

And what comes into your mind certainly will not come about, when you say: “We will be like the nations, like the families of the lands, serving wood and stone.”

## Ezekiel 20:33

As I live,’ declares the Lord God, ‘with a mighty hand and with an outstretched arm and with wrath poured out, I assuredly shall be king over you.

## Ezekiel 20:34

I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you from the lands where you are scattered, with a mighty hand and with an outstretched arm and with wrath poured out;

## Ezekiel 20:35

And I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there I will enter into judgment with you face to face.

## Ezekiel 20:36

Just as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will enter into judgment with you,’ declares the Lord God.

## Ezekiel 20:37

‘I will make you pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant;

## Ezekiel 20:38

And I will purge from you the rebels and those who revolt against Me; I will bring them out of the land where they reside, but they will not enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Lord.

## Ezekiel 20:39

As for you, house of Israel,’ this is what the Lord God says: ‘Go, serve every one of you his idols; but later you will surely listen to Me, and My holy name you will no longer defile with your gifts and with your idols.

## Ezekiel 20:40

For on My holy mountain, on the high mountain of Israel,’ declares the Lord God, ‘there the whole house of Israel, all of them, will serve Me in the land; there I will accept them, and there I will demand your contributions and the choicest of your gifts, with all your holy things.

## Ezekiel 20:41

As a soothing aroma I will accept you, when I bring you out from the peoples and gather you from the lands where you are scattered; and I will show Myself holy among you in the sight of the nations.

## Ezekiel 20:42

And you will know that I am the Lord when I bring you to the land of Israel, into the land which I swore to give to your forefathers.

## Ezekiel 20:43

There you will remember your ways and all your deeds by which you have defiled yourselves; and you will loathe yourselves in your own sight for all the evil things that you have done.

## Ezekiel 20:44

Then you will know that I am the Lord, when I have dealt with you for the sake of My name, not in accordance with your evil ways or with your corrupt deeds, house of Israel,’ declares the Lord God.”

## Ezekiel 20:45

Now the word of the Lord came to me, saying,

## Ezekiel 20:46

“Son of man, set your face toward the south, preach against the south, and prophesy against the forest of the field in the Negev,

## Ezekiel 20:47

And say to the forest of the Negev, ‘Hear the word of the Lord: This is what the Lord God says: “Behold, I am kindling a fire in you, and it will consume every green tree in you, as well as every dry tree; the blazing flame will not be extinguished, and the whole surface from south to north will be scorched by it.

## Ezekiel 20:48

And all mankind will see that I, the Lord, have kindled it; it shall not be extinguished.”’”

## Ezekiel 20:49

Then I said, “Oh Lord God! They are saying of me, ‘Is he not just speaking in parables?’”
