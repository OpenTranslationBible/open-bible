# Ezekiel Chapter 24

## Ezekiel 24:1

Now the word of the Lord came to me in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth of the month, saying,

## Ezekiel 24:2

“Son of man, write the name of the day, this very day. The king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem this very day.

## Ezekiel 24:3

Present a parable to the rebellious house and say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says:

> Put on the pot, put it on  
> and also pour water into it;

## Ezekiel 24:4

> Put in it the pieces,  
> every good piece,  
> the thigh and the shoulder;  
> fill it with the choicest bones.

## Ezekiel 24:5

> Take the choicest of the flock,  
> and also stack wood under the pot.  
> Boil it thoroughly.  
> Also boil its bones in it.’

## Ezekiel 24:6

Therefore, this is what the Lord God says:

> ‘Woe to the bloody city,  
> the pot in which there is rust,  
> and whose rust has not gone out of it!  
> Take out piece after piece,  
> without making a choice.

## Ezekiel 24:7

> For her blood is in her midst;  
> she placed it on the bare rock;  
> she did not pour it on the ground  
> to cover it with dust.

## Ezekiel 24:8

> So that it would cause wrath to come up to take vengeance,  
> I have put her blood on the bare rock,  
> so that it would not be covered.’

## Ezekiel 24:9

Therefore, this is what the Lord God says:

> ‘Woe to the bloody city!  
> I also will make the pile great.

## Ezekiel 24:10

> Heap on the wood,  
> kindle the fire,  
> boil the meat well,  
> mix in the spices,  
> and let the bones be burned.

## Ezekiel 24:11

> Then set it empty on its coals  
> so that it may be hot and its bronze may glow,  
> and its filthiness may be melted in it,  
> its rust consumed.

## Ezekiel 24:12

> She has wearied Me with toil,  
> yet her great rust has not gone from her;  
> her rust will not go away by fire.

## Ezekiel 24:13

In your filthiness is lewdness. Because I would have cleansed you, yet you were not clean, you will not be cleansed from your filthiness again until I have satisfied My wrath against you.

## Ezekiel 24:14

I, the Lord, have spoken; it is coming, and I will act. I will not relent, and I will not have pity, and I will not be sorry. According to your ways and your deeds, I will judge you,’ declares the Lord God.”

## Ezekiel 24:15

And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,

## Ezekiel 24:16

“Son of man, behold, I am about to take from you the desire of your eyes with a fatal blow; but you shall not mourn, and you shall not weep, and your tears shall not come.

## Ezekiel 24:17

Groan silently; do no mourning for the dead. Bind on your turban and put on your sandals, and do not cover your mustache, and do not eat bread of mourners.”

## Ezekiel 24:18

So I spoke to the people in the morning, and in the evening my wife died. And in the morning I did as I was commanded.

## Ezekiel 24:19

And the people said to me, “Will you not tell us what these things mean for us, that you are doing?”

## Ezekiel 24:20

So I said to them, “The word of the Lord came to me, saying,

## Ezekiel 24:21

‘Speak to the house of Israel: “This is what the Lord God says: Behold, I am about to profane My sanctuary, the pride of your power, the desire of your eyes and the delight of your soul; and your sons and your daughters whom you have left behind will fall by the sword.

## Ezekiel 24:22

And you will do just as I have done; you will not cover your mustache, and you will not eat the bread of mourners.

## Ezekiel 24:23

Your turbans will be on your heads and your sandals on your feet. You will not mourn, and you will not weep, but you will rot away in your guilty deeds, and you will groan to one another.

## Ezekiel 24:24

So Ezekiel will be a sign to you; you will do just as he has done. When it comes, then you will know that I am the Lord God.”’

## Ezekiel 24:25

‘As for you, son of man, will it not be on the day when I take from them their stronghold, the joy of their splendour, the desire of their eyes and the longing of their souls, and also their sons and their daughters,

## Ezekiel 24:26

That on that day the one who escapes will come to you with information for your ears?

## Ezekiel 24:27

On that day your mouth will be opened to the one who escaped, and you will speak and no longer be silent. So you will be a sign to them, and they will know that I am the Lord.’”
