# Ezekiel Chapter 15

## Ezekiel 15:1

Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying,

## Ezekiel 15:2

“Son of man, how is the wood of the vine better than any wood of a branch which is among the trees of the forest?

## Ezekiel 15:3

Can wood be taken from it to make anything, or can men take a peg from it on which to hang any object?

## Ezekiel 15:4

If it has been put into the fire for fuel, and the fire has consumed both of its ends and its middle has been charred, is it useful for anything?

## Ezekiel 15:5

Behold, while it is intact, it is not made into anything; how much less, when the fire has consumed it and it is charred, can it still be made into anything!

## Ezekiel 15:6

Therefore, this is what the Lord God says: ‘Just as the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so have I given up the inhabitants of Jerusalem;

## Ezekiel 15:7

And I will set My face against them. Though they have come out of the fire, yet the fire will consume them. Then you will know that I am the Lord, when I set My face against them.

## Ezekiel 15:8

So I will make the land desolate, because they have acted unfaithfully,’” declares the Lord God.
