# Ezekiel Chapter 35

## Ezekiel 35:1

Moreover, the word of the Lord came to me, saying,

## Ezekiel 35:2

“Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir and prophesy against it,

## Ezekiel 35:3

And say to it, ‘This is what the Lord God says:  
“Behold, I am against you, Mount Seir,  
And I will stretch out My hand against you  
And make you a desolation and a waste.

## Ezekiel 35:4

I will turn your cities to ruins,  
And you will become a desolation.  
Then you will know that I am the Lord.

## Ezekiel 35:5

Because you have had everlasting hostility  
And have turned over the sons of Israel to the power of the sword  
At the time of their disaster,  
At the time of the final punishment,”

## Ezekiel 35:6

Therefore, as I live,” declares the Lord God,  
“I will certainly doom you to bloodshed, and bloodshed will pursue you;  
Since you have not hated bloodshed, therefore bloodshed will pursue you.

## Ezekiel 35:7

So I will make Mount Seir a desolation and a waste,  
And I will eliminate from it one who passes through and returns.

## Ezekiel 35:8

I will fill its mountains with its slain;  
On your hills, in your valleys, and in all your ravines  
Those slain by the sword will fall.

## Ezekiel 35:9

I will make you an everlasting desolation,  
And your cities will not be inhabited.  
Then you will know that I am the Lord.

## Ezekiel 35:10

Because you have said, ‘These two nations and these two lands will be mine, and we will possess them,’ although the Lord was there,

## Ezekiel 35:11

Therefore, as I live,” declares the Lord God,  
“I will deal with you according to your anger and according to your envy  
Which you showed because of your hatred against them.  
So I will make Myself known among them when I judge you.

## Ezekiel 35:12

Then you will know that I, the Lord, have heard all your contemptuous words which you have spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying,  
‘They have been laid desolate; they have been given to us as food.’

## Ezekiel 35:13

And you have spoken arrogantly against Me with your mouth and have multiplied your words against Me; I Myself have heard it.”

## Ezekiel 35:14

This is what the Lord God says:  
“As all the earth rejoices, I will make you a desolation.

## Ezekiel 35:15

As you rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel because it was desolate,  
So I will do the same to you.  
You will become a desolation, Mount Seir, and all Edom, all of it.  
Then they will know that I am the Lord.”’
