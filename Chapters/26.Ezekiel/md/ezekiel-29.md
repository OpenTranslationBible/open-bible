# Ezekiel Chapter 29

## Ezekiel 29:1

In the tenth year, in the tenth month, on the twelfth of the month, the word of the Lord came to me, saying,

## Ezekiel 29:2

“Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and prophesy against him and against all Egypt.

## Ezekiel 29:3

Speak and say, ‘This is what the Lord God says:

> “Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt,  
> The great monster that lies in the midst of his canals,  
> That has said, ‘My Nile is mine, and I myself have made it.’

## Ezekiel 29:4

> I will put hooks in your jaws  
> And make the fish of your canals cling to your scales.  
> And I will bring you up from the midst of your canals,  
> And all the fish of your canals will cling to your scales.

## Ezekiel 29:5

> I will abandon you in the wilderness,  
> You and all the fish of your canals;  
> You will fall on the open field;  
> You will not be picked up or buried.  
> I have given you for food  
> To the animals of the earth and the birds of the sky.

## Ezekiel 29:6

Then all the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am the Lord,  
Because they have been only a staff made of reed to the house of Israel.

## Ezekiel 29:7

When they took hold of you with the hand,  
You broke and tore all their hands;  
And when they leaned on you,  
You broke and made all their hips shake.”

## Ezekiel 29:8

‘Therefore the Lord God says this: “Behold, I am going to bring upon you a sword, and I will eliminate human and animal from you.

## Ezekiel 29:9

The land of Egypt will become a desolation and a waste.  
Then they will know that I am the Lord.  
Because you said, ‘The Nile is mine, and I made it,’

## Ezekiel 29:10

Therefore, behold, I am against you and your canals,  
And I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation,  
From Migdol to Syene, even as far as the border of Cush.

## Ezekiel 29:11

No human foot will pass through it, and no animal foot will pass through it,  
And it will not be inhabited for forty years.

## Ezekiel 29:12

So I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of desolated lands.  
And her cities, in the midst of cities that are in ruins, will be desolate for forty years;  
And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the lands.”

## Ezekiel 29:13

‘For this is what the Lord God says: “At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the peoples among whom they were scattered.

## Ezekiel 29:14

And I will restore the fortunes of Egypt and bring them back to the land of Pathros, to the land of their origin, and there they will be a lowly kingdom.

## Ezekiel 29:15

It will be the lowest of the kingdoms, and it will not raise itself above the nations again.  
And I will make them so small that they will not rule over the nations.

## Ezekiel 29:16

And it will never again be the confidence of the house of Israel,  
Bringing to mind the guilt of their having turned to Egypt.  
Then they will know that I am the Lord God.”’”

## Ezekiel 29:17

Now in the twenty-seventh year, in the first month, on the first of the month, the word of the Lord came to me, saying,

## Ezekiel 29:18

“Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made his army labor hard against Tyre; every head was made bald and every shoulder rubbed bare. But he and his army had no wages from Tyre for the labor he had performed against it.”

## Ezekiel 29:19

Therefore this is what the Lord God says: “Behold, I am going to give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. And he will carry off her abundance and capture her spoils and seize her plunder; and it will be wages for his army.

## Ezekiel 29:20

I have given him the land of Egypt as his compensation for which he labored, because they acted for Me,” declares the Lord God.

## Ezekiel 29:21

“On that day I will make a horn sprout for the house of Israel, and I will open your mouth among them; then they will know that I am the Lord.”
