# Ezekiel Chapter 4

## Ezekiel 4:1

“Now you, son of man, take a brick, place it before you, and engrave on it a city, Jerusalem.

## Ezekiel 4:2

Then lay siege against it, build a siege wall, raise a ramp, pitch camps, and place battering rams against it all around.

## Ezekiel 4:3

Then take for yourself an iron plate and set it up as an iron wall between you and the city, and direct your face toward it so that it is under siege and besiege it. This is a sign to the house of Israel.

## Ezekiel 4:4

Then lie down on your left side and lay the guilt of the house of Israel on it. For the number of days that you lie on it, you shall bear their guilt.

## Ezekiel 4:5

For I have assigned you a number of days corresponding to the years of their guilt, 390 days; so you shall bear the guilt of the house of Israel.

## Ezekiel 4:6

When you have completed these, you shall lie down a second time, but on your right side and bear the guilt of the house of Judah. I have assigned it to you for forty days, a day for each year.

## Ezekiel 4:7

Then you shall direct your face toward the siege of Jerusalem with your arm bared, and prophesy against it.

## Ezekiel 4:8

Now behold, I will put ropes upon you so that you cannot turn from one side to the other until you have completed the days of your siege.

## Ezekiel 4:9

But as for you, take wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt, put them in one vessel, and make bread for yourself; you shall eat it according to the number of days that you lie on your side, 390 days.

## Ezekiel 4:10

Your food which you eat shall be twenty shekels a day by weight; you shall eat it from time to time.

## Ezekiel 4:11

You shall also drink water by measure, a sixth of a hin; you shall drink it from time to time.

## Ezekiel 4:12

Eat it as a barley cake, baking it in their sight over human dung.”

## Ezekiel 4:13

Then the Lord said, “In this way the sons of Israel will eat their bread unclean among the nations where I will banish them.”

## Ezekiel 4:14

But I said, “Ah, Lord God! Behold, I have never been defiled; from my youth until now I have never eaten what died of itself or was torn by animals, nor has any impure meat ever entered my mouth!”

## Ezekiel 4:15

Then He said to me, “See, I will give you cow's dung in place of human dung over which you shall prepare your bread.”

## Ezekiel 4:16

Moreover, He said to me, “Son of man, behold, I am going to break the staff of bread in Jerusalem, and they will eat bread by weight and with anxiety, and drink water by measure and in horror,

## Ezekiel 4:17

Because bread and water will be scarce; and they will be appalled with one another and rot away in their guilt.
