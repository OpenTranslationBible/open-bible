# Ezekiel Chapter 12

## Ezekiel 12:1

Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying,

## Ezekiel 12:2

“Son of man, you live in the midst of the rebellious house, who have eyes to see but do not see, ears to hear but do not hear; for they are a rebellious house.

## Ezekiel 12:3

So as for you, son of man, prepare for yourself baggage for exile, and go into exile by day in their sight; go into exile from your place to another place in their sight. Perhaps they will understand, though they are a rebellious house.

## Ezekiel 12:4

Bring out your baggage by day in their sight, as baggage for exile. Then you shall go out at evening in their sight, as those going into exile.

## Ezekiel 12:5

Dig a hole through the wall in their sight and go out through it.

## Ezekiel 12:6

Load the baggage on your shoulder in their sight and carry it out in the dark. Cover your face so that you cannot see the land, for I have appointed you as a sign to the house of Israel.”

## Ezekiel 12:7

So I did just as I was commanded. I brought out my baggage by day as baggage for exile. Then in the evening I dug through the wall with my hands. I went out in the dark and carried the baggage on my shoulder in their sight.

## Ezekiel 12:8

In the morning the word of the Lord came to me, saying,

## Ezekiel 12:9

“Son of man, has the house of Israel, the rebellious house, not said to you, ‘What are you doing?’

## Ezekiel 12:10

Say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says: This pronouncement concerns the prince in Jerusalem as well as all the house of Israel who are in it.’

## Ezekiel 12:11

Say, ‘I am a sign to you. Just as I have done, so it will be done to them; they will go into exile, into captivity.’

## Ezekiel 12:12

The prince who is among them will load his baggage on his shoulder in the dark and go out. They will dig a hole through the wall to bring it out. He will cover his face so that he cannot see the land with his eyes.

## Ezekiel 12:13

I will also spread My net over him, and he will be caught in My trap. And I will bring him to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans; yet he will not see it, though he will die there.

## Ezekiel 12:14

And I will scatter to every wind all who are around him, his helpers and all his troops; and I will draw a sword after them.

## Ezekiel 12:15

So they will know that I am the Lord when I scatter them among the nations and disperse them among the countries.

## Ezekiel 12:16

But I will spare a few of them from the sword, the famine, and the plague so that they may tell of all their abominations among the nations where they go, and may know that I am the Lord.”

## Ezekiel 12:17

Moreover, the word of the Lord came to me, saying,

## Ezekiel 12:18

“Son of man, eat your bread with trembling, and drink your water with quivering and anxiety.

## Ezekiel 12:19

Then say to the people of the land, ‘This is what the Lord God says regarding the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the land of Israel: They will eat their bread with anxiety and drink their water with horror, because their land will be stripped of its fullness on account of the violence of all who live in it.

## Ezekiel 12:20

The inhabited cities will be laid waste, and the land will be a desolation. So you will know that I am the Lord.’”

## Ezekiel 12:21

Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying,

## Ezekiel 12:22

“Son of man, what is this proverb you people have about the land of Israel, saying, ‘The days are long, and every vision fails’?

## Ezekiel 12:23

Therefore say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says: I will put an end to this proverb, and they will no longer use it as a proverb in Israel.’ But say to them, ‘The days are approaching when every vision will be fulfilled.

## Ezekiel 12:24

For there will no longer be any false vision or flattering divination within the house of Israel.

## Ezekiel 12:25

For I, the Lord, will speak, and whatever word I speak will be performed. It will no longer be delayed, for in your days, you rebellious house, I will speak the word and perform it,’ declares the Lord God.”

## Ezekiel 12:26

Furthermore, the word of the Lord came to me, saying,

## Ezekiel 12:27

“Son of man, behold, the house of Israel is saying, ‘The vision that he sees is for many years from now, and he prophesies of times far off!’

## Ezekiel 12:28

Therefore say to them, ‘This is what the Lord God says: None of My words will be delayed any longer. Whatever word I speak will be performed,’ declares the Lord God.”
