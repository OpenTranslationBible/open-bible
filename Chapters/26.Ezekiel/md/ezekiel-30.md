# Ezekiel Chapter 30

## Ezekiel 30:1

The word of the Lord came again to me, saying,

## Ezekiel 30:2

“Son of man, prophesy and say, ‘This is what the Lord God says:

> Wail,
> “Woe to the day!”

## Ezekiel 30:3

> For the day is near,  
> Indeed, the day of the Lord is near;  
> It will be a day of clouds,  
> A time of doom for the nations.

## Ezekiel 30:4

> A sword will come upon Egypt,  
> And there will be trembling in Cush;  
> When the slain fall in Egypt,  
> They take away her wealth,  
> And her foundations are torn down.

## Ezekiel 30:5

Cush, Put, Lud, all Arabia, Libya, and the people of the land that is in league will fall with them by the sword.”

## Ezekiel 30:6

This is what the Lord says:

> “Indeed, those who support Egypt will fall,  
> And the pride of her power will come down;  
> From Migdol to Syene they will fall within her by the sword,”  
> Declares the Lord God.

## Ezekiel 30:7

> “They will be desolate  
> In the midst of the desolated lands;  
> And her cities will be  
> In the midst of the devastated cities.

## Ezekiel 30:8

> And they will know that I am the Lord,  
> When I set a fire in Egypt  
> And all her helpers are broken.

## Ezekiel 30:9

On that day messengers will go out from Me in ships to frighten carefree Cush,  
And trembling will come on them as on the day of Egypt;  
For behold, it is coming!”

## Ezekiel 30:10

This is what the Lord God says:

> “I will also make the horde of Egypt cease  
> By the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.

## Ezekiel 30:11

> He and his people with him,  
> The most ruthless of the nations,  
> Will be brought in to destroy the land;  
> And they will draw their swords against Egypt  
> And fill the land with the slain.

## Ezekiel 30:12

> Moreover, I will make the canals dry  
> And sell the land into the hands of evil men.  
> And I will make the land desolate,  
> And everything that is in it,  
> By the hand of strangers;

I, the Lord, have spoken.”

## Ezekiel 30:13

This is what the Lord God says:

> “I will also destroy the idols  
> And make the images cease from Memphis.  
> And there will no longer be a prince in the land of Egypt;  
> And I will put fear in the land of Egypt.

## Ezekiel 30:14

> So I will make Pathros desolate,  
> Set a fire in Zoan,  
> And execute judgments on Thebes.

## Ezekiel 30:15

> I will pour out My wrath on Sin,  
> The stronghold of Egypt;  
> I will also eliminate the horde of Thebes.

## Ezekiel 30:16

> I will set a fire in Egypt;  
> Sin will writhe in anguish,  
> Thebes will be breached,  
> And Memphis will have distresses daily.

## Ezekiel 30:17

> The young men of On and of Pi-beseth  
> Will fall by the sword,  
> And the women will go into captivity.

## Ezekiel 30:18

> In Tehaphnehes the day will be dark  
> When I break the yoke of Egypt there.  
> Then the pride of her power will come to an end;  
> A cloud will cover her,  
> And her daughters will go into captivity.

## Ezekiel 30:19

> So I will execute judgments on Egypt,  
> And they will know that I am the Lord.”

## Ezekiel 30:20

Now in the eleventh year, in the first month, on the seventh of the month, the word of the Lord came to me, saying,

## Ezekiel 30:21

“Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and behold, it has not been bound up to heal by putting a bandage on it, to wrap it with splints so that it may be strong to wield the sword.”

## Ezekiel 30:22

Therefore this is what the Lord God says:  
“Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt,  
And will break his arms, both the strong and the broken;  
And I will make the sword fall from his hand.

## Ezekiel 30:23

I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations  
And disperse them among the lands.

## Ezekiel 30:24

For I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon  
And put My sword in his hand;  
And I will break the arms of Pharaoh,  
So that he will groan before him  
With the groanings of a wounded man.

## Ezekiel 30:25

So I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon,  
But the arms of Pharaoh will fall.  
Then they will know that I am the Lord,  
When I put My sword into the hand of the king of Babylon  
And he stretches it out against the land of Egypt.

## Ezekiel 30:26

When I scatter the Egyptians among the nations  
And disperse them among the lands,  
Then they will know that I am the Lord.”
