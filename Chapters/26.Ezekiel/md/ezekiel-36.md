# Ezekiel Chapter 36

## Ezekiel 36:1

Now you, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel and say, ‘Mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord.

## Ezekiel 36:2

This is what the Lord God says: “Since the enemy has spoken against you, ‘Aha! The everlasting heights have become our possession,’

## Ezekiel 36:3

Therefore, prophesy and say, ‘This is what the Lord God says: “For good reason they have made you desolate and crushed you from every side, so that you would become a possession of the rest of the nations, and you have been taken up in the speech of those who talk and slander the people.”’

## Ezekiel 36:4

Therefore, mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God: ‘This is what the Lord God says to the mountains, the hills, the ravines, the valleys, the desolate ruins, and the abandoned cities, which have become plunder and a target of slander for the rest of the nations around—

## Ezekiel 36:5

Therefore the Lord God says this: “Certainly in the fire of My jealousy I have spoken against the rest of the nations, and against all Edom, who appropriated My land for themselves as a possession with wholehearted joy and with scorn of soul, to drive it out for plunder.”

## Ezekiel 36:6

Therefore, prophesy concerning the land of Israel and say to the mountains, the hills, the ravines, and the valleys, ‘This is what the Lord God says: “Behold, I have spoken in My jealousy and in My wrath because you have endured the insults of the nations.”

## Ezekiel 36:7

Therefore the Lord God says this: “I have sworn that the nations which are around you will certainly endure their own insults.

## Ezekiel 36:8

But you, mountains of Israel, you will grow your branches and bear your fruit for My people Israel; for they are about to come.

## Ezekiel 36:9

For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn to you, and you will be cultivated and sown.

## Ezekiel 36:10

And I will multiply people on you, all the house of Israel, all of it; and the cities will be inhabited, and the ruins will be rebuilt.

## Ezekiel 36:11

I will multiply on you people and animals, and they will increase and be fruitful; and I will cause you to be inhabited as you were formerly, and treat you better than at the beginning. Then you will know that I am the Lord.

## Ezekiel 36:12

Yes, I will have people—My people Israel—walk on you and possess you, so that you will become their inheritance and never again bereave them of children.”

## Ezekiel 36:13

The Lord God says this: “Because they say to you, ‘You are a devourer of people and have bereaved your nation of children,’

## Ezekiel 36:14

Therefore you will no longer devour people and no longer bereave your nation of children,” declares the Lord God.

## Ezekiel 36:15

“I will not let you hear insults from the nations anymore, nor will you bear disgrace from the peoples any longer, nor will you make your nation stumble any longer,” declares the Lord God.’”

## Ezekiel 36:16

Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying,

## Ezekiel 36:17

“Son of man, when the house of Israel was living in their own land, they defiled it by their ways and their deeds; their way before Me was like the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity.

## Ezekiel 36:18

So I poured out My wrath on them for the blood which they had shed on the land, because they had defiled it with their idols.

## Ezekiel 36:19

I also scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed throughout the lands. According to their ways and their deeds I judged them.

## Ezekiel 36:20

When they came to the nations where they went, they profaned My holy name, because it was said of them, ‘These are the people of the Lord, yet they have left His land.’

## Ezekiel 36:21

But I had concern for My holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations where they went.

## Ezekiel 36:22

“Therefore say to the house of Israel, ‘This is what the Lord God says: “It is not for your sake, house of Israel, that I am about to act, but for the sake of My holy name, which you have profaned among the nations where you went.

## Ezekiel 36:23

And I will vindicate the holiness of My great name which has been profaned among the nations, which you have profaned in their midst. Then the nations will know that I am the Lord,” declares the Lord God, “when I prove Myself holy among you in their sight.

## Ezekiel 36:24

For I will take you from the nations, and gather you from all the lands; and I will bring you into your own land.

## Ezekiel 36:25

Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean; I will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from all your idols.

## Ezekiel 36:26

Moreover, I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.

## Ezekiel 36:27

And I will put My Spirit within you and bring it about that you walk in My statutes, and are careful and follow My ordinances.

## Ezekiel 36:28

And you will live in the land that I gave to your forefathers; so you will be My people, and I will be your God.

## Ezekiel 36:29

Moreover, I will save you from all your uncleanness; and I will call for the grain and multiply it, and I will not bring a famine on you.

## Ezekiel 36:30

I will also multiply the fruit of the trees and the produce of the field, so that you will not receive again the disgrace of famine among the nations.

## Ezekiel 36:31

Then you will remember your evil ways and your deeds that were not good, and you will loathe yourselves in your own sight for your wrongdoings and your abominations.

## Ezekiel 36:32

I am not doing this for your sake,” declares the Lord God; “let it be known to you. Be ashamed and humiliated for your ways, house of Israel!”

## Ezekiel 36:33

‘This is what the Lord God says: “On the day that I cleanse you from all your guilt, I will populate the cities, and the ruins will be rebuilt.

## Ezekiel 36:34

The desolated land will be cultivated instead of being a desolation in the sight of everyone who passes by.

## Ezekiel 36:35

And they will say, ‘This desolated land has become like the garden of Eden; and the wasted, desolated, and ruined cities are fortified and inhabited.’

## Ezekiel 36:36

Then the nations that are left all around you will know that I, the Lord, have rebuilt the ruined places and planted that which was desolated; I, the Lord, have spoken, and I will do it.”

## Ezekiel 36:37

‘This is what the Lord God says: “I will also let the house of Israel ask Me to do this for them: I will increase their people like a flock.

## Ezekiel 36:38

Like the flock for sacrifices, like the flock at Jerusalem during her appointed feasts, so will the waste cities be filled with flocks of people. Then they will know that I am the Lord.”’
