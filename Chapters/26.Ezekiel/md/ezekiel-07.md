# Ezekiel Chapter 7

## Ezekiel 7:1

Moreover, the word of the Lord came to me, saying,

## Ezekiel 7:2

“And you, son of man, this is what the Lord God says to the land of Israel: ‘An end! The end is coming on the four corners of the land.

## Ezekiel 7:3

Now the end is upon you, and I will send My anger against you; I will judge you according to your ways and bring all your abominations upon you.

## Ezekiel 7:4

For My eye will have no pity on you, nor will I spare you, but I will bring your ways upon you, and your abominations will be among you; then you will know that I am the Lord!’

## Ezekiel 7:5

This is what the Lord God says: ‘A disaster, a unique disaster, behold, it is coming!

## Ezekiel 7:6

An end is coming; the end has come! It has awakened against you; behold, it has come!

## Ezekiel 7:7

Doom has come to you, you inhabitant of the land. The time has come, the day is near—panic rather than joyful shouting on the mountains.

## Ezekiel 7:8

Now I will shortly pour out My wrath on you and exhaust My anger against you; I will judge you according to your ways and bring on you all your abominations.

## Ezekiel 7:9

My eye will have no pity nor will I spare; I will repay you according to your ways, while your abominations are among you; then you will know that I, the Lord, am striking you.

## Ezekiel 7:10

Behold, the day! Behold, it is coming!  
Your doom has gone out; the rod has budded, arrogance has bloomed.

## Ezekiel 7:11

Violence has grown into a rod of wickedness.  
None of them shall remain, none of their people, none of their wealth, nor anything eminent among them.

## Ezekiel 7:12

The time has come, the day has arrived.  
Let neither the buyer rejoice nor the seller mourn, for wrath is against all their multitude.

## Ezekiel 7:13

Indeed, the seller will not regain what was sold as long as they both live; for the vision regarding all their multitude will not be revoked, and no one will preserve his life because of his wrongdoing.

## Ezekiel 7:14

They have blown the trumpet and made everything ready, but no one is going to the battle, for My wrath is against all their multitude.

## Ezekiel 7:15

The sword is outside, and the plague and famine are within.  
Whoever is in the field will die by the sword; and whoever is in the city, famine and plague will consume him.

## Ezekiel 7:16

Even when their survivors escape, they will be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, each over his own wrongdoing.

## Ezekiel 7:17

All hands will hang limp, and all knees will drip with water.

## Ezekiel 7:18

They will put on sackcloth, and horror will cover them; and shame will be on all faces and baldness on all their heads.

## Ezekiel 7:19

They will fling their silver into the streets, and their gold will become an abhorrent thing.  
Their silver and gold will not be able to save them on the day of the Lord’s wrath.  
They will not satisfy their appetite nor fill their stomachs, because their wrongdoing has become a cause of stumbling.

## Ezekiel 7:20

They transformed the beauty of His ornaments into pride, and they made the images of their abominations and idols with it; therefore, He has made it an abhorrent thing to them.

## Ezekiel 7:21

I will hand it over as plunder to the foreigners and to the wicked of the earth as spoil, and they will profane it.

## Ezekiel 7:22

I will also turn My face away from them, and they will defile My secret place; then violators will enter it and defile it.

## Ezekiel 7:23

Forge the chain, for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.

## Ezekiel 7:24

Therefore, I will bring the worst of the nations, and they will take possession of their houses.  
I will also put an end to the pride of the strong, and their holy places will be profaned.

## Ezekiel 7:25

When anguish comes, they will seek peace, but there will be none.

## Ezekiel 7:26

Disaster will come upon disaster, and rumour will follow rumour; then they will seek a vision from a prophet, but the Law will be lost from the priest and counsel from the elders.

## Ezekiel 7:27

The king will mourn, the prince will be clothed with horror, and the hands of the people of the land will tremble.  
According to their conduct I will deal with them, and by their own judgements I will judge them. Then they will know that I am the Lord.
