with their brothers opposite them,  
to praise and give thanks, as prescribed by David the man of God, division corresponding to division.

## Nehemiah 12:25

Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were gatekeepers,  
keeping watch at the storerooms of the gates.

the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and Ezra the priest and scribe.

## Nehemiah 12:27

Now at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem,  
they sought out the Levites from all their places,  
to bring them to Jerusalem so that they might celebrate the dedication with joy,  
with hymns of thanksgiving and songs,  
with cymbals, harps, and lyres.

## Nehemiah 12:28

So the sons of the singers gathered from the region around Jerusalem,  
and from the villages of the Netophathites,

## Nehemiah 12:29

from Beth-gilgal, and from their fields in Geba and Azmaveth,  
for the singers had built themselves villages around Jerusalem.

## Nehemiah 12:30

The priests and the Levites purified themselves;  
they also purified the people, the gates, and the wall.

---

## Nehemiah 12:31

Then I had the leaders of Judah come up on top of the wall,  
and I appointed two great choirs,  
the first proceeding to the right on top of the wall toward the Dung Gate.

## Nehemiah 12:32

Hoshaiah and half of the leaders of Judah followed them,

## Nehemiah 12:33

with Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam,

## Nehemiah 12:34

Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah,

## Nehemiah 12:35

and some of the sons of the priests with trumpets;  
and Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah,  
the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah,  
the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph,

## Nehemiah 12:36

and his relatives, Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani,  
with the musical instruments of David the man of God.  
And Ezra the scribe went before them.

## Nehemiah 12:37

At the Fountain Gate they went straight up the steps of the city of David by the stairway of the wall,  
above the house of David, to the Water Gate on the east.

---

## Nehemiah 12:38

The second choir proceeded to the left,  
while I followed them with half of the people on the wall,  
above the Tower of Furnaces, to the Broad Wall,

## Nehemiah 12:39

and above the Gate of Ephraim, by the Old Gate, by the Fish Gate,  
the Tower of Hananel, and the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Sheep Gate;  
and they stopped at the Gate of the Guard.

---

## Nehemiah 12:40

Then the two choirs took their position in the house of God.  
So did I and half of the officials with me,

## Nehemiah 12:41

and the priests: Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah with trumpets,

## Nehemiah 12:42

and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer.  
And the singers sang loudly, with Jezrahiah their overseer.

## Nehemiah 12:43

On that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced  
because God had given them great joy;  
even the women and children rejoiced,  
so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard from far away.

---

## Nehemiah 12:44

On that day men were also appointed over the chambers for the stores, the contributions, the first fruits, and the tithes,  
to gather into them from the fields of the cities the portions required by the Law  
for the priests and Levites;  
for Judah rejoiced over the priests and Levites who served.

## Nehemiah 12:45

For they performed the service of their God and the service of purification,  
together with the singers and the gatekeepers,  
in accordance with the command of David and of his son Solomon.

## Nehemiah 12:46

For in the days of David and Asaph, in ancient times,  
there were leaders of the singers, songs of praise and hymns of thanksgiving to God.

## Nehemiah 12:47

So all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah gave the portions due the singers and the gatekeepers,  
as each day required,  
and set apart the consecrated portion for the Levites,  
and the Levites set apart the consecrated portion for the sons of Aaron.
