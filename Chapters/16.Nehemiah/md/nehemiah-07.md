# Nehemiah Chapter 7

## Nehemiah 7:1

Now when the wall was rebuilt and I had installed the doors,  
and the gatekeepers, the singers, and the Levites were appointed,

## Nehemiah 7:2

I put Hanani my brother, and Hananiah the commander of the citadel, in charge of Jerusalem,  
for he was a faithful man and feared God more than many.

## Nehemiah 7:3

Then I said to them,  
“The gates of Jerusalem are not to be opened until the sun is hot,  
and while they are standing guard, let them shut and bolt the doors.  
Also, appoint guards from the inhabitants of Jerusalem,  
each at his post, and each in front of his own house.”

## Nehemiah 7:4

Now the city was large and spacious, but the people in it were few,  
and houses had not been rebuilt.

## Nehemiah 7:5

Then my God put it into my heart to assemble the nobles, the officials, and the people  
to be enrolled by genealogies.  
Then I found the book of the genealogy of those who came up first,  
and I found written in it:

## Nehemiah 7:6

These are the people of the province who came up from the captivity of the exiles  
whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had taken into exile,  
and who returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his city,
