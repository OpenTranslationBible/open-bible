## Nehemiah 10:28

Now the rest of the people,  
the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the temple servants,  
and all those who had separated themselves from the peoples of the lands to the Law of God,  
their wives, their sons and daughters, all those who had knowledge and understanding,

## Nehemiah 10:29

are joining with their relatives, their nobles,  
and are taking on themselves a curse and an oath to walk in God's Law,  
which was given through Moses, Godâ€™s servant,  
and to keep and to comply with all the commandments of God our Lord,  
and His ordinances and His statutes;

---

## Nehemiah 10:30

and that we will not give our daughters to the peoples of the land  
or take their daughters for our sons.

---

## Nehemiah 10:31

As for the peoples of the land who bring wares or any grain on the Sabbath day to sell,  
we will not buy from them on the Sabbath or on a holy day;  
and we will forego the crops of the seventh year and the collection of every debt.

---

## Nehemiah 10:32

We also placed ourselves under obligation to contribute yearly one-third of a shekel  
for the service of the house of our God:

## Nehemiah 10:33

for the showbread, for the continual grain offering, for the continual burnt offering,  
the Sabbaths, the new moons, for the appointed times, for the holy offerings,  
and for the sin offerings to make atonement for Israel,  
and all the work of the house of our God.

---

## Nehemiah 10:34

Likewise we cast lots for the supply of wood among the priests, the Levites, and the people,  
in order to bring it to the house of our God annually,  
at the appointed times, to burn on the altar of the Lord our God, as it is written in the Law;

---

## Nehemiah 10:35

and so that they would bring the first fruits of our ground and the first fruits of all the fruit  
of every tree to the house of the Lord annually,

## Nehemiah 10:36

and bring to the house of our God the firstborn of our sons and of our livestock,  
as it is written in the Law,  
and the firstborn of our herds and our flocks  
to the priests who serve in the house of our God.

---

## Nehemiah 10:37

We will also bring the first of our dough, our contributions,  
the fruit of every tree, the new wine, and the oil to the priests  
at the chambers of the house of our God,  
and the tithe of our ground to the Levites,  
for the Levites are the ones who receive the tithes in all the rural towns.

## Nehemiah 10:38

And the priest, the son of Aaron, shall be with the Levites when the Levites receive tithes,  
and the Levites shall bring one-tenth of the tithes  
to the house of our God, to the chambers of the storehouse.

## Nehemiah 10:39

For the sons of Israel and the sons of Levi shall bring the contribution of the grain,  
the new wine, and the oil to the chambers;  
there are the utensils of the sanctuary, the priests who minister,  
the gatekeepers, and the singers.

---

So we will not neglect the house of our God.
