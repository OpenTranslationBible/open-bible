# Galatians Chapter 5

## Galatians 5:1

It was for freedom that Christ set us free; therefore stand firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery.

## Galatians 5:2

Look, I, Paul, say to you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will be of no benefit to you.

## Galatians 5:3

And I testify again to every man who receives circumcision, that he is obligated to keep the whole Law.

## Galatians 5:4

You have been severed from Christ, you who are seeking to be justified by the Law; you have fallen from grace.

## Galatians 5:5

For we, through the Spirit, by faith, are waiting for the hope of righteousness.

## Galatians 5:6

For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but faith working through love.

## Galatians 5:7

You were running well; who hindered you from obeying the truth?

## Galatians 5:8

This persuasion did not come from Him who calls you.

## Galatians 5:9

A little leaven leavens the whole lump of dough.

## Galatians 5:10

I have confidence in you in the Lord, that you will adopt no other view; but the one who is disturbing you will bear the punishment, whoever he is.

## Galatians 5:11

But as for me, brothers and sisters, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross has been eliminated.

## Galatians 5:12

I wish that those who are troubling you would even emasculate themselves.

## Galatians 5:13

For you were called to freedom, brothers and sisters; only do not turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but serve one another through love.

## Galatians 5:14

For the whole Law is fulfilled in one word, in the statement, “You shall love your neighbour as yourself.”

## Galatians 5:15

But if you bite and devour one another, take care that you are not consumed by one another.

## Galatians 5:16

But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh.

## Galatians 5:17

For the desire of the flesh is against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are in opposition to one another, in order to keep you from doing whatever you want.

## Galatians 5:18

But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law.

## Galatians 5:19

Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are: sexual immorality, impurity, indecent behaviour,

## Galatians 5:20

Idolatry, witchcraft, hostilities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions,

## Galatians 5:21

Envy, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, of which I forewarn you, just as I forewarned you, that those who practise such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.

## Galatians 5:22

But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,

## Galatians 5:23

Gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.

## Galatians 5:24

Now those who belong to Christ Jesus crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.

## Galatians 5:25

If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.

## Galatians 5:26

Let us not become boastful, challenging one another, envying one another.
