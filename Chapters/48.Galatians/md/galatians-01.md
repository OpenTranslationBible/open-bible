# Galatians Chapter 1

## Galatians 1:1

Paul, an apostle— not sent from men nor through the agency of man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised Him from the dead—

## Galatians 1:2

And all the brothers who are with me,  
To the churches of Galatia:

## Galatians 1:3

Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,

## Galatians 1:4

Who gave Himself for our sins so that He might rescue us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,

## Galatians 1:5

To whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.

## Galatians 1:6

I am amazed that you are so quickly deserting Him who called you by the grace of Christ, for a different gospel,

## Galatians 1:7

Which is not just another account; but there are some who are disturbing you and want to distort the gospel of Christ.

## Galatians 1:8

But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we have preached to you, he is to be accursed!

## Galatians 1:9

As we have said before, even now I say again: if anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received, he is to be accursed!

## Galatians 1:10

For am I now seeking the favour of people, or of God? Or am I striving to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a bond-servant of Christ.

## Galatians 1:11

For I make known to you, brothers and sisters, that the gospel which was preached by me is not of human origin.

## Galatians 1:12

For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.

## Galatians 1:13

For you have heard of my former way of life in Judaism, how I used to persecute the church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it;

## Galatians 1:14

And I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries among my countrymen, being more extremely zealous for my ancestral traditions.

## Galatians 1:15

But when He who had set me apart even from my mother’s womb and called me through His grace was pleased

## Galatians 1:16

To reveal His Son in me so that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood,

## Galatians 1:17

Nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me; but I went away to Arabia, and returned once more to Damascus.

## Galatians 1:18

Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to become acquainted with Cephas, and stayed with him fifteen days.

## Galatians 1:19

But I did not see another one of the apostles except James, the Lord’s brother.

## Galatians 1:20

(Now in what I am writing to you, I assure you before God that I am not lying.)

## Galatians 1:21

Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.

## Galatians 1:22

I was still unknown by sight to the churches of Judea which are in Christ;

## Galatians 1:23

But they only kept hearing, “The man who once persecuted us is now preaching the faith which he once tried to destroy.”

## Galatians 1:24

And they were glorifying God because of me.
