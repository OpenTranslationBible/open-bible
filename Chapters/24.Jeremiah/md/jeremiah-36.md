# Jeremiah Chapter 36

## Jeremiah 36:1  
Now it came about in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, that this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying,

## Jeremiah 36:2  
“Take a scroll and write on it all the words which I have spoken to you concerning Israel, Judah, and all the nations, from the day I first spoke to you, from the days of Josiah, even to this day.

## Jeremiah 36:3  
Perhaps the house of Judah will hear all the disaster which I plan to bring on them, so that every person will turn from his evil way;  
then I will forgive their wrongdoing and their sin.”

## Jeremiah 36:4  
Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah, and Baruch wrote on a scroll at Jeremiah’s dictation all the words of the Lord which He had spoken to him.

## Jeremiah 36:5  
And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying,  
“I am restricted; I cannot go into the house of the Lord.

## Jeremiah 36:6  
So you shall go and read from the scroll, which you have written at my dictation, the words of the Lord to the people at the Lord’s house on a day of fasting.  
And you shall also read them to all the people of Judah who come from their cities.

## Jeremiah 36:7  
Perhaps their pleading will come before the Lord, and every person will turn from his evil way,  
for great is the anger and the wrath that the Lord has declared against this people.”

## Jeremiah 36:8  
So Baruch the son of Neriah did everything that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading from the book the words of the Lord in the house of the Lord.

## Jeremiah 36:9  
Now in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month,  
all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem proclaimed a fast before the Lord.

## Jeremiah 36:10  
Then Baruch read from the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the Lord,  
in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the upper courtyard,  
at the entry of the New Gate of the Lord’s house, to all the people.

## Jeremiah 36:11  
Now when Micaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard all the words of the Lord from the book,

## Jeremiah 36:12  
he went down to the king’s house, into the scribe’s chamber.  
And behold, all the officials were sitting there—Elishama the scribe, Delaiah the son of Shemaiah,  
Elnathan the son of Achbor, Gemariah the son of Shaphan, Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the other officials.

## Jeremiah 36:13  
And Micaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard when Baruch read from the book to the people.

## Jeremiah 36:14  
Then all the officials sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying,  
“Take the scroll that you read to the people and come.”  
So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and came to them.

## Jeremiah 36:15  
And they said to him, “Sit down, please, and read it to us.”  
So Baruch read it to them.

## Jeremiah 36:16  
When they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one to another and said to Baruch,  
“We will certainly report all these words to the king.”

## Jeremiah 36:17  
And they asked Baruch, saying, “Tell us please, how did you write all these words? Was it at his dictation?”

## Jeremiah 36:18  
Then Baruch said to them, “He dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them with ink on the scroll.”

## Jeremiah 36:19  
Then the officials said to Baruch, “Go, hide yourself, you and Jeremiah, and do not let anyone know where you are.”

## Jeremiah 36:20  
So they went to the king in the courtyard, but they had deposited the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe;  
and they reported all the words to the king.

## Jeremiah 36:21  
Then the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he took it from the chamber of Elishama the scribe.  
And Jehudi read it to the king as well as to all the officials who stood beside the king.

## Jeremiah 36:22  
Now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month, with a fire burning in the brazier before him.

## Jeremiah 36:23  
When Jehudi had read three or four columns, the king cut it with a scribe’s knife and threw it into the fire that was in the brazier,  
until the entire scroll was burned in the fire that was in the brazier.

## Jeremiah 36:24  
Yet the king and all his servants who heard all these words were not afraid, nor did they tear their garments.

## Jeremiah 36:25  
Even though Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah pleaded with the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them.

## Jeremiah 36:26  
And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king’s son, Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel to seize Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet,  
but the Lord hid them.

## Jeremiah 36:27  
Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah after the king had burned the scroll and the words which Baruch had written at the dictation of Jeremiah, saying,

## Jeremiah 36:28  
“Take again another scroll and write on it all the former words that were on the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah burned.

## Jeremiah 36:29  
And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say,  
‘This is what the Lord says:  
“You have burned this scroll, saying, ‘Why have you written on it that the king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land and will make mankind and animals disappear from it?’”

## Jeremiah 36:30  
Therefore this is what the Lord says about Jehoiakim king of Judah:  
“He shall have no one to sit on the throne of David,  
and his dead body shall be thrown out to the heat of the day and the frost of the night.

## Jeremiah 36:31  
I will also punish him, his descendants, and his servants for their wrongdoing,  
and I will bring on them and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the people of Judah all the disaster that I have declared to them—  
but they did not listen.”’”

## Jeremiah 36:32  
Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the son of Neriah the scribe,  
and he wrote on it at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire;  
and many similar words were added to them.
