# Jeremiah Chapter 23

## Jeremiah 23:1  
“Woe to the shepherds who are destroying and scattering the sheep of My pasture!” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 23:2  
Therefore this is what the Lord, the God of Israel says concerning the shepherds who are tending My people:  
“You have scattered My flock and driven them away, and have not been concerned about them;  
Behold, I am going to call you to account for the evil of your deeds,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 23:3  
“Then I Myself will gather the remnant of My flock out of all the countries where I have driven them,  
And bring them back to their pasture,  
And they will be fruitful and multiply.

## Jeremiah 23:4  
I will also raise up shepherds over them and they will tend them;  
And they will not be afraid any longer, nor be terrified,  
Nor will any be missing,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 23:5  
“Behold, the days are coming,” declares the Lord,  
“When I will raise up for David a righteous Branch;  
And He will reign as king and act wisely,  
And do justice and righteousness in the land.

## Jeremiah 23:6  
In His days Judah will be saved,  
And Israel will live securely;  
And this is His name by which He will be called:  
‘The Lord Our Righteousness.’

## Jeremiah 23:7  
Therefore behold, the days are coming,” declares the Lord,  
“when they will no longer say, ‘As the Lord lives, who brought the sons of Israel up from the land of Egypt,’

## Jeremiah 23:8  
but, ‘As the Lord lives, who brought up and led the descendants of the household of Israel back from the north land and from all the countries where I had driven them.’  
Then they will live on their own soil.”

## Jeremiah 23:9  
As for the prophets:  
My heart is broken within me,  
All my bones tremble;  
I have become like a drunken man,  
Even like a man overcome with wine,  
Because of the Lord  
And because of His holy words.

## Jeremiah 23:10  
For the land is full of adulterers;  
For the land mourns because of the curse.  
The pastures of the wilderness have dried up.  
Their course is evil  
And their might is not right.

## Jeremiah 23:11  
“For both prophet and priest are defiled;  
Even in My house I have found their wickedness,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 23:12  
“Therefore their way will be like slippery paths to them,  
They will be driven away into the gloom and fall down in it;  
For I will bring disaster upon them,  
The year of their punishment,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 23:13  
“Moreover, among the prophets of Samaria I saw an offensive thing:  
They prophesied by Baal and led My people Israel astray.

## Jeremiah 23:14  
Also among the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a horrible thing:  
The committing of adultery and walking in lies;  
And they strengthen the hands of evildoers,  
So that no one has turned back from his wickedness.  
All of them have become to Me like Sodom,  
And her inhabitants like Gomorrah.

## Jeremiah 23:15  
Therefore this is what the Lord of armies says concerning the prophets:  
‘Behold, I am going to feed them wormwood  
And make them drink poisonous water,  
For from the prophets of Jerusalem  
Pollution has spread into all the land.’”

## Jeremiah 23:16  
This is what the Lord of armies says:  
“Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are prophesying to you.  
They are leading you into futility;  
They tell a vision of their own imagination,  
Not from the mouth of the Lord.

## Jeremiah 23:17  
They keep saying to those who despise Me,  
‘The Lord has said, “You will have peace”’;  
And as for everyone who walks in the stubbornness of his own heart,  
They say, ‘Disaster will not come upon you.’

## Jeremiah 23:18  
But who has stood in the council of the Lord,  
That he should see and hear His word?  
Who has paid attention to His word and heard it?

## Jeremiah 23:19  
Behold, the storm of the Lord has gone out in wrath,  
Even a whirling storm;  
It will swirl down on the head of the wicked.

## Jeremiah 23:20  
The anger of the Lord will not turn back  
Until He has performed and carried out the purposes of His heart.  
In the last days you will clearly understand it.

## Jeremiah 23:21  
I did not send these prophets,  
But they ran.  
I did not speak to them,  
But they prophesied.

## Jeremiah 23:22  
But if they had stood in My council,  
Then they would have announced My words to My people,  
And would have turned them back from their evil way  
And from the evil of their deeds.

## Jeremiah 23:23  
“Am I a God who is near,” declares the Lord,  
“And not a God far off?

## Jeremiah 23:24  
Can a person hide himself in hiding places  
So that I do not see him?” declares the Lord.  
“Do I not fill the heavens and the earth?” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 23:25  
“I have heard what the prophets have said who prophesy falsely in My name, saying, ‘I had a dream, I had a dream!’

## Jeremiah 23:26  
How long? Is there anything in the hearts of the prophets who prophesy falsehood,  
These prophets of the deceit of their own heart,

## Jeremiah 23:27  
Who intend to make My people forget My name by their dreams which they relate to one another,  
Just as their fathers forgot My name because of Baal?

## Jeremiah 23:28  
The prophet who has a dream may relate his dream,  
But let him who has My word speak My word truthfully.  
What does straw have in common with grain?” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 23:29  
“Is My word not like fire?” declares the Lord,  
“And like a hammer which shatters a rock?

## Jeremiah 23:30  
Therefore behold, I am against the prophets,” declares the Lord,  
“Who steal My words from each other.

## Jeremiah 23:31  
Behold, I am against the prophets,” declares the Lord,  
“Who use their tongues and declare, ‘The Lord declares!’

## Jeremiah 23:32  
Behold, I am against those who have prophesied false dreams,” declares the Lord,  
“And reported them and led My people astray by their lies and reckless boasting;  
Yet I did not send them nor command them, nor do they provide this people the slightest benefit,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 23:33  
“Now when this people, or the prophet, or a priest asks you, saying, ‘What is the pronouncement of the Lord?’  
Then you shall say to them, ‘What pronouncement?’  
The Lord declares, ‘I will abandon you.’

## Jeremiah 23:34  
Then as for the prophet or the priest or the people who say, ‘The pronouncement of the Lord,’  
I will bring punishment upon that person and his household.

## Jeremiah 23:35  
This is what each of you shall say to his neighbor and to his brother:  
‘What has the Lord answered?’ or, ‘What has the Lord spoken?’

## Jeremiah 23:36  
But you are not to mention the ‘pronouncement of the Lord’ again,  
Because every man’s own word will become the pronouncement,  
And you have perverted the words of the living God, the Lord of armies, our God.

## Jeremiah 23:37  
This is what you shall say to that prophet:  
‘What has the Lord answered you?’ and, ‘What has the Lord spoken?’

## Jeremiah 23:38  
But since you say, ‘The pronouncement of the Lord,’  
Therefore, this is what the Lord says:  
‘Because you have said this word, “The pronouncement of the Lord,”  
Even though I told you not to say, “The pronouncement of the Lord,”

## Jeremiah 23:39  
Therefore, behold, I will assuredly forget you and throw you away from My presence,  
You and the city which I gave you and your fathers.

## Jeremiah 23:40  
And I will put an everlasting disgrace on you and everlasting humiliation which will not be forgotten.’”
