# Jeremiah Chapter 31

## Jeremiah 31:1  
“At that time,” declares the Lord, “I will be the God of all the families of Israel, and they will be My people.”

## Jeremiah 31:2  
This is what the Lord says:  
“The people who survived the sword  
Found grace in the wilderness—  
Israel, when it went to find its rest.”

## Jeremiah 31:3  
The Lord appeared to him long ago, saying,  
“I have loved you with an everlasting love;  
Therefore I have drawn you out with kindness.

## Jeremiah 31:4  
I will build you again and you will be rebuilt,  
Virgin of Israel!  
You will take up your tambourines again  
And go out to the dances of the revelers.

## Jeremiah 31:5  
Again you will plant vineyards  
On the hills of Samaria;  
The planters will plant  
And will enjoy the fruit.

## Jeremiah 31:6  
For there will be a day when watchmen on the hills of Ephraim call out,  
‘Arise, and let’s go up to Zion,  
To the Lord our God!’”

## Jeremiah 31:7  
For this is what the Lord says:  
“Sing aloud with joy for Jacob,  
And be joyful with the chief of the nations;  
Proclaim, give praise, and say,  
‘Lord, save Your people,  
The remnant of Israel!’

## Jeremiah 31:8  
Behold, I am bringing them from the north country,  
And I will gather them from the remote parts of the earth,  
Among them those who are blind and those who limp,  
The pregnant woman and she who is in labor, together;  
They will return here as a great assembly.

## Jeremiah 31:9  
They will come with weeping,  
And by pleading I will bring them;  
I will lead them by streams of waters,  
On a straight path on which they will not stumble;  
For I am a father to Israel,  
And Ephraim is My firstborn.”

## Jeremiah 31:10  
Hear the word of the Lord, you nations,  
And declare it in the coastlands far away,  
And say, “He who scattered Israel will gather him,  
And He will keep him as a shepherd keeps his flock.”

## Jeremiah 31:11  
For the Lord has redeemed Jacob  
And saved him from the hand of him who was stronger than he.

## Jeremiah 31:12  
They will come and shout for joy on the height of Zion,  
And they will be radiant over the bounty of the Lord—  
Over the grain, the new wine, the oil,  
And over the young of the flock and the herd;  
And their life will be like a watered garden,  
And they will never languish again.

## Jeremiah 31:13  
Then the virgin will rejoice in the dance,  
And the young men and the old together;  
For I will turn their mourning into joy  
And will comfort them and give them joy instead of sorrow.

## Jeremiah 31:14  
I will refresh the soul of the priests with abundance,  
And My people will be satisfied with My goodness,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 31:15  
This is what the Lord says:  
“A voice is heard in Ramah,  
Lamenting and bitter weeping.  
Rachel is weeping for her children;  
She refuses to be comforted for her children,  
Because they are no more.”

## Jeremiah 31:16  
This is what the Lord says:  
“Restrain your voice from weeping  
And your eyes from tears;  
For your work will be rewarded,” declares the Lord,  
“And they will return from the land of the enemy.

## Jeremiah 31:17  
There is hope for your future,” declares the Lord,  
“And your children will return to their own territory.

## Jeremiah 31:18  
I have certainly heard Ephraim grieving,  
‘You have disciplined me, and I was corrected,  
Like an untrained calf;  
Bring me back so that I may be restored,  
For You are the Lord my God.

## Jeremiah 31:19  
For after I turned back, I repented;  
And after I was instructed, I slapped my thigh;  
I was ashamed and also humiliated  
Because I bore the disgrace of my youth.’

## Jeremiah 31:20  
Is Ephraim My dear son?  
Is he a delightful child?  
Indeed, as often as I have spoken against him,  
I certainly still remember him;  
Therefore My heart yearns for him;  
I will certainly have mercy on him,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 31:21  
Set up road markers for yourself,  
Establish signposts for yourself;  
Pay attention to the highway,  
The road by which you went.  
Return, O virgin of Israel,  
Return to these your cities.

## Jeremiah 31:22  
How long will you slip away,  
O faithless daughter?  
For the Lord has created a new thing on the earth:  
A woman will shelter a man.

## Jeremiah 31:23  
This is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel says:  
“Once again they will speak this word in the land of Judah and in its cities,  
When I restore their fortunes,  
‘The Lord bless you, O place of righteousness,  
O holy hill!’

## Jeremiah 31:24  
Judah and all its cities will live in it together:  
The farmers and they who travel with flocks.

## Jeremiah 31:25  
For I give plenty of water to the weary soul,  
And refresh every soul that languishes.”

## Jeremiah 31:26  
At this I awoke and looked, and my sleep had been pleasant to me.

## Jeremiah 31:27  
“Behold, days are coming,” declares the Lord,  
“when I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah  
With the seed of people and the seed of animals.

## Jeremiah 31:28  
And just as I have watched over them to uproot, tear down, overthrow, destroy, and bring disaster,  
So I will watch over them to build and to plant,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 31:29  
“In those days they will no longer say,  
‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes,  
But it is the children’s teeth that have become blunt.’

## Jeremiah 31:30  
But everyone will die for his own wrongdoing;  
Each person who eats the sour grapes,  
His own teeth will become blunt.

## Jeremiah 31:31  
“Behold, days are coming,” declares the Lord,  
“when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah,

## Jeremiah 31:32  
not like the covenant which I made with their fathers  
On the day I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt,  
My covenant which they broke,  
Although I was a husband to them,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 31:33  
“For this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel  
After those days,” declares the Lord:  
“I will put My Law within them and write it on their heart;  
And I will be their God, and they shall be My people.

## Jeremiah 31:34  
They will not teach again, each one his neighbor and each one his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’  
For they will all know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them,” declares the Lord,  
“For I will forgive their wrongdoing,  
And their sin I will no longer remember.”

## Jeremiah 31:35  
This is what the Lord says,  
He who gives the sun for light by day,  
And the fixed order of the moon and the stars for light by night,  
Who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar—  
The Lord of armies is His name:

## Jeremiah 31:36  
“If this fixed order departs  
From Me,” declares the Lord,  
“Then the descendants of Israel also will cease  
To be a nation before Me forever.”

## Jeremiah 31:37  
This is what the Lord says:  
“If the heavens above can be measured  
And the foundations of the earth searched out below,  
Then I will also reject all the descendants of Israel  
For everything that they have done,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 31:38  
“Behold, days are coming,” declares the Lord,  
“when the city will be rebuilt for the Lord  
From the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate.

## Jeremiah 31:39  
The measuring line will go out farther  
Straight ahead to the hill Gareb; then it will turn to Goah.

## Jeremiah 31:40  
And the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes,  
And all the fields as far as the brook Kidron,  
To the corner of the Horse Gate toward the east,  
Shall be holy to the Lord;  
It will not be uprooted or overthrown again forever.”
