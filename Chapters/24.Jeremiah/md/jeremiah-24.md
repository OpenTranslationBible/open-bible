# Jeremiah Chapter 24

## Jeremiah 24:1  
After Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken into exile Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the officials of Judah with the craftsmen and smiths from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon,  
the Lord showed me: behold, two baskets of figs placed in front of the temple of the Lord!

## Jeremiah 24:2  
One basket had very good figs, like first-ripe figs,  
And the other basket had very bad figs, which could not be eaten due to rottenness.

## Jeremiah 24:3  
Then the Lord said to me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?”  
And I said, “Figs—the good figs, very good; and the bad ones, very bad, so bad that they cannot be eaten.”

## Jeremiah 24:4  
Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying,

## Jeremiah 24:5  
“This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says:  
‘Like these good figs, so I will regard as good the exiles of Judah, whom I have sent from this place into the land of the Chaldeans.

## Jeremiah 24:6  
For I will set My eyes on them for good, and I will bring them back to this land;  
And I will build them up and not overthrow them, and I will plant them and not uproot them.

## Jeremiah 24:7  
And I will give them a heart to know Me, that I am the Lord;  
And they will be My people, and I will be their God, for they will return to Me with their whole heart.’

## Jeremiah 24:8  
‘But like the bad figs, which cannot be eaten due to rottenness—indeed, this is what the Lord says—  
so I will give up Zedekiah king of Judah, and his officials, and the remnant of Jerusalem who remain in this land and the ones who live in the land of Egypt.

## Jeremiah 24:9  
I will make them an object of terror and evil among all the kingdoms of the earth,  
A reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse in all the places where I will scatter them.

## Jeremiah 24:10  
And I will send the sword, the famine, and the plague upon them  
Until they are eliminated from the land that I gave to them and their fathers.’”
