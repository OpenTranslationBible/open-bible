# Jeremiah Chapter 41

## Jeremiah 41:1  
In the seventh month, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal family and one of the chief officers of the king,  
came with ten men to Mizpah to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.  
While they were eating bread together there in Mizpah,

## Jeremiah 41:2  
Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him rose up and struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the sword and killed him,  
whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land.

## Jeremiah 41:3  
Ishmael also struck down all the Jews who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans who were found there, the men of war.

## Jeremiah 41:4  
Now it happened on the next day after the killing of Gedaliah, when no one yet knew about it,

## Jeremiah 41:5  
that eighty men came from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, with their beards shaved off, their clothes torn, and their bodies gashed,  
bringing grain offerings and incense to present at the house of the Lord.

## Jeremiah 41:6  
Then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah left Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he walked;  
and as he met them, he said to them, “Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam!”

## Jeremiah 41:7  
Yet as soon as they came inside the city, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the men who were with him slaughtered them and threw them into the cistern.

## Jeremiah 41:8  
But ten men who were found among them said to Ishmael, “Do not kill us, for we have hidden stores of wheat, barley, oil, and honey in the field.”  
So he refrained and did not kill them along with their companions.

## Jeremiah 41:9  
Now as for the cistern where Ishmael had thrown all the corpses of the men whom he had killed because of Gedaliah—  
it was the one that King Asa had made on account of Baasha king of Israel—  
Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with the dead.

## Jeremiah 41:10  
Then Ishmael took captive all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah,  
the king’s daughters and all the rest of the people who were left in Mizpah,  
whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard had put under the care of Gedaliah the son of Ahikam;  
and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah took them and set out to cross over to the sons of Ammon.

## Jeremiah 41:11  
But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were with him heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done.

## Jeremiah 41:12  
So they took all the men and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah,  
and they found him by the large pool that is in Gibeon.

## Jeremiah 41:13  
Now as soon as all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah and the commanders of the forces who were with him, they were glad.

## Jeremiah 41:14  
So all the people whom Ishmael had taken captive from Mizpah turned around and came back,  
and went to Johanan the son of Kareah.

## Jeremiah 41:15  
But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men and went to the sons of Ammon.

## Jeremiah 41:16  
Then Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces that were with him took from Mizpah all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah,  
after he had struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam—  
the men who were soldiers, the women, the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gibeon.

## Jeremiah 41:17  
And they went and stayed in Geruth Chimham, which is beside Bethlehem,  
in order to proceed into Egypt

## Jeremiah 41:18  
because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them,  
since Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam,  
whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land.
