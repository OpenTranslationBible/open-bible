# Jeremiah Chapter 27

## Jeremiah 27:1  
In the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying—

## Jeremiah 27:2  
This is what the Lord said to me: “Make for yourself restraints and yokes and put them on your neck,

## Jeremiah 27:3  
and send word to the kings of Edom, Moab, the sons of Ammon, Tyre, and Sidon by the messengers who come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah.

## Jeremiah 27:4  
Command them in behalf of their masters, saying, ‘This is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel says:  
“This is what you shall say to your masters:

## Jeremiah 27:5  
‘I have made the earth, mankind, and the animals which are on the face of the earth  
By My great power and by My outstretched arm,  
And I will give it to the one who is pleasing in My sight.

## Jeremiah 27:6  
And now I have handed all these lands over to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, My servant,  
And I have also given him the wild animals of the field to serve him.

## Jeremiah 27:7  
All the nations shall serve him, his son, and his grandson until the time of his own land comes;  
Then many nations and great kings will make him their servant.

## Jeremiah 27:8  
But it will be that the nation or kingdom which does not serve him, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,  
And does not put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon,  
I will punish that nation with the sword, with famine, and with plague,” declares the Lord,  
“Until I have eliminated it by his hand.

## Jeremiah 27:9  
So do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, your dreamers, your soothsayers, or your sorcerers who speak to you, saying,  
‘You will not serve the king of Babylon.’

## Jeremiah 27:10  
For they are prophesying a lie to you in order to remove you far from your land;  
And I will drive you away and you will perish.

## Jeremiah 27:11  
But the nation that will bring its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him,  
I will let remain on its land,” declares the Lord, “and they will cultivate it and live in it.”’”

## Jeremiah 27:12  
I also spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah in accordance with all these words, saying,  
“Put your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him and his people, and live!

## Jeremiah 27:13  
Why should you die, you and your people, by the sword, famine, and plague, as the Lord has spoken to the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?

## Jeremiah 27:14  
So do not listen to the words of the prophets who speak to you, saying,  
‘You will not serve the king of Babylon,’  
For they are prophesying a lie to you;

## Jeremiah 27:15  
For I have not sent them,” declares the Lord, “but they are prophesying falsely in My name,  
So that I will drive you away and that you will perish, you and the prophets who prophesy to you.”

## Jeremiah 27:16  
Then I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying,  
“This is what the Lord says:  
‘Do not listen to the words of your prophets who prophesy to you, saying,  
“Behold, the articles of the Lord’s house will now shortly be brought back from Babylon”;  
For they are prophesying a lie to you.

## Jeremiah 27:17  
Do not listen to them;  
Serve the king of Babylon and live!  
Why should this city become a place of ruins?

## Jeremiah 27:18  
But if they are prophets, and if the word of the Lord is with them,  
Have them now plead with the Lord of armies,  
So that the articles which are left in the house of the Lord, in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem, do not go to Babylon.

## Jeremiah 27:19  
For this is what the Lord of armies says concerning the pillars, the sea, the stands, and the rest of the articles that are left in this city,

## Jeremiah 27:20  
Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take when he led into exile Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, along with all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem—

## Jeremiah 27:21  
Yes, this is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, says concerning the articles that are left in the house of the Lord,  
And in the house of the king of Judah and in Jerusalem:

## Jeremiah 27:22  
‘They will be brought to Babylon, and they will be there until the day I visit them,’ declares the Lord.  
‘Then I will bring them back and restore them to this place.’”
