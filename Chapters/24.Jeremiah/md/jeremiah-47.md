# Jeremiah Chapter 47

## Jeremiah 47:1  
The word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines before Pharaoh attacked Gaza.

## Jeremiah 47:2  
Thus says the Lord of armies: “Behold, waters are coming up from the north—  
they will become an overflowing flood, and will overflow the land and all that fills it;  
The city, and those who dwell in it, will go down; fighters will cry out in that day.

## Jeremiah 47:3  
The noise of the buckler and the shield,  
The noise of the battle cry!  
For the Lord is destroying the land of the Philistines and wiping out the inhabitants of the coasts.

## Jeremiah 47:4  
Baldness has come on Gaza;  
Ashkelon is cut off completely;  
Orem and Gaza will be ashamed;  
They have left their confidence;  
The king and his princes have departed together.

## Jeremiah 47:5  
O remnant of the coastland,  
How long will you gash yourself?  
The Lord has created you;  
He will punish you severely, and restore you to health.

## Jeremiah 47:6  
For the Lord of armies says: “Behold, disaster is coming on the coastland—  
on the Philistines—and great destruction.

## Jeremiah 47:7  
Baldness has come on Gaza; Ashkelon is cut off completely;  
Orem and Gaza are ashamed;  
They have gone into captivity together.”
