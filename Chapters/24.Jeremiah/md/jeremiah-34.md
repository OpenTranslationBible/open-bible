# Jeremiah Chapter 34

## Jeremiah 34:1  
The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army, with all the kingdoms of the earth that were under his control, and all the peoples, were fighting against Jerusalem and against all its cities, saying,

## Jeremiah 34:2  
“This is what the Lord, the God of Israel says: Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah and say to him, ‘This is what the Lord says: Behold, I am going to hand this city over to the king of Babylon, and he will burn it with fire.

## Jeremiah 34:3  
And you will not escape from his hand, for you will assuredly be caught and handed over to him; and you will see the king of Babylon eye to eye, and he will speak with you face to face, and you will go to Babylon.’”

## Jeremiah 34:4  
Yet hear the word of the Lord, O Zedekiah king of Judah: “This is what the Lord says about you: ‘You will not die by the sword;

## Jeremiah 34:5  
You will die in peace; and as spices were burned for your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so they will burn spices for you; and they will mourn for you, saying, “Oh, master!”’ For I have spoken the word,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 34:6  
Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem.

## Jeremiah 34:7  
When the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and the remaining cities of Judah, that is, Lachish and Azekah; for they alone remained as fortified cities among the cities of Judah.

## Jeremiah 34:8  
The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who were in Jerusalem, to proclaim release to them:

## Jeremiah 34:9  
That each man was to set free his male servant and each man his female servant, a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman, so that no one would keep them in bondage, a Jew his brother.

## Jeremiah 34:10  
And all the officials and all the people who had entered into the covenant heard that each man was to set his male servant free and each his female servant, so that no one would keep them any longer in bondage; so they obeyed and set them free.

## Jeremiah 34:11  
But afterward they turned around and took back the male and female servants whom they had set free, and brought them into subjection as slaves.

## Jeremiah 34:12  
Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying,

## Jeremiah 34:13  
“This is what the Lord, the God of Israel says: ‘I made a covenant with your forefathers on the day I brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery, saying,

## Jeremiah 34:14  
“At the end of seven years each of you shall set free his Hebrew brother who has been sold to you and has served you six years; you shall send him out free from you.” But your forefathers did not obey Me nor incline their ear to Me.

## Jeremiah 34:15  
Although recently you had turned and done what is right in My sight, each one proclaiming release to his neighbor, and you had made a covenant before Me in the house which is called by My name.

## Jeremiah 34:16  
Yet you turned and profaned My name, and each took back his male servant and each his female servant whom you had set free according to their desire, and you brought them into subjection to be your slaves.

## Jeremiah 34:17  
Therefore this is what the Lord says: “You have not obeyed Me in proclaiming release, each to his brother and each to his neighbor. Behold, I am proclaiming release to you,” declares the Lord, “to the sword, to the plague, and to the famine; and I will make you an object of terror to all the kingdoms of the earth.

## Jeremiah 34:18  
I will give the people who have violated My covenant, who have not fulfilled the words of the covenant which they made before Me, when they cut the calf in two and passed between its parts—

## Jeremiah 34:19  
the officials of Judah and the officials of Jerusalem, the court officers and the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf—

## Jeremiah 34:20  
I will hand them over to their enemies and to those who seek their lives. And their dead bodies will be food for the birds of the sky and the animals of the earth.

## Jeremiah 34:21  
Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials I will also hand over to their enemies and to those who seek their lives, and to the army of the king of Babylon which has withdrawn from you.

## Jeremiah 34:22  
Behold, I am going to command,” declares the Lord, “and I will bring them back to this city; and they will fight against it and take it and burn it with fire; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without inhabitant.”
