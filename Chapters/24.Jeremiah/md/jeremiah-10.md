# Jeremiah Chapter 10

## Jeremiah 10:1  
Hear the word which the Lord speaks to you, house of Israel.

## Jeremiah 10:2  
This is what the Lord says:  
“Do not learn the way of the nations,  
And do not be terrified by the signs of the heavens,  
Although the nations are terrified by them;

## Jeremiah 10:3  
For the customs of the peoples are useless;  
For it is wood cut from the forest,  
The work of the hands of a craftsman with a cutting tool.

## Jeremiah 10:4  
They decorate it with silver and gold;  
They fasten it with nails and hammers  
So that it will not totter.

## Jeremiah 10:5  
They are like a scarecrow in a cucumber field, and they cannot speak;  
They must be carried,  
Because they cannot walk!  
Do not fear them,  
For they can do no harm,  
Nor can they do any good.”

## Jeremiah 10:6  
There is none like You, Lord;  
You are great, and Your name is great in might.

## Jeremiah 10:7  
Who would not fear You, O King of the nations?  
Indeed it is Your due!  
For among all the wise men of the nations  
And in all their kingdoms,  
There is none like You.

## Jeremiah 10:8  
But they are altogether stupid and foolish;  
The instruction from idols is nothing but wood!

## Jeremiah 10:9  
Beaten silver is brought from Tarshish,  
And gold from Uphaz,  
The work of a craftsman and of the hands of a goldsmith;  
Their clothing is violet and purple;  
They are all the work of skilled people.

## Jeremiah 10:10  
But the Lord is the true God;  
He is the living God and the everlasting King.  
At His wrath the earth quakes,  
And the nations cannot endure His indignation.

## Jeremiah 10:11  
This is what you shall say to them:  
“The gods that did not make the heavens and the earth  
Will perish from the earth and from under the heavens.”

## Jeremiah 10:12  
It is He who made the earth by His power,  
Who established the world by His wisdom;  
And by His understanding He has stretched out the heavens.

## Jeremiah 10:13  
When He utters His voice, there is a roar of waters in the heavens,  
And He makes the clouds ascend from the end of the earth;  
He makes lightning for the rain,  
And brings out the wind from His storehouses.

## Jeremiah 10:14  
Every person is stupid, devoid of knowledge;  
Every goldsmith is put to shame by his idols,  
For his cast metal images are deceitful,  
And there is no breath in them.

## Jeremiah 10:15  
They are worthless, a work of mockery;  
At the time of their punishment they will perish.

## Jeremiah 10:16  
The Portion of Jacob is not like these;  
For He is the Maker of everything,  
And Israel is the tribe of His inheritance;  
The Lord of armies is His name.

## Jeremiah 10:17  
Pick up your bundle from the ground,  
You who live under siege!

## Jeremiah 10:18  
For this is what the Lord says:  
“Behold, I am slinging out the inhabitants of the land  
At this time,  
And I will cause them distress,  
So that they may be found.”

## Jeremiah 10:19  
Woe to me, because of my injury!  
My wound is incurable.  
But I said, “This certainly is a sickness,  
And I must endure it.”

## Jeremiah 10:20  
My tent has been destroyed,  
And all my ropes have been torn apart;  
My sons have gone from me and are no more.  
There is no one to stretch out my tent again  
Or to set up my curtains.

## Jeremiah 10:21  
For the shepherds have become stupid  
And have not sought the Lord.  
Therefore they have not prospered,  
And all their flock is scattered.

## Jeremiah 10:22  
The sound of a report! Behold, it is coming—  
A great roar from the land of the north—  
To make the cities of Judah  
A desolation, a haunt of jackals.

## Jeremiah 10:23  
I know, Lord, that a person’s way is not in himself,  
Nor is it in a person who walks to direct his steps.

## Jeremiah 10:24  
Correct me, Lord, but with justice;  
Not with Your anger, or You will bring me to nothing.

## Jeremiah 10:25  
Pour out Your wrath on the nations that do not know You,  
And on the families who do not call upon Your name;  
For they have devoured Jacob;  
They have devoured him and consumed him,  
And have laid waste his settlement.
