# Jeremiah Chapter 29

## Jeremiah 29:1  
Now these are the words of the letter which Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the rest of the elders of the exile, the priests, the prophets, and all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon.

## Jeremiah 29:2  
(This was after King Jeconiah and the queen mother, the court officials, the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the smiths had departed from Jerusalem.)

## Jeremiah 29:3  
The letter was sent by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, saying,

## Jeremiah 29:4  
“This is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel, says to all the exiles whom I have sent into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon:

## Jeremiah 29:5  
Build houses and live in them; and plant gardens and eat their produce.

## Jeremiah 29:6  
Take wives and father sons and daughters, and take wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands, so that they may give birth to sons and daughters;  
And grow in numbers there and do not decrease.

## Jeremiah 29:7  
Seek the prosperity of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the Lord in its behalf;  
For in its prosperity will be your prosperity.

## Jeremiah 29:8  
For this is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel says:  
“Do not let your prophets who are in your midst or your diviners deceive you, and do not listen to their interpretations of your dreams which you dream.

## Jeremiah 29:9  
For they prophesy falsely to you in My name; I have not sent them,” declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 29:10  
For this is what the Lord says: “When seventy years have been completed for Babylon, I will visit you and fulfill My good word to you, to bring you back to this place.

## Jeremiah 29:11  
For I know the plans that I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans for prosperity and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope.

## Jeremiah 29:12  
Then you will call upon Me and come and pray to Me, and I will listen to you.

## Jeremiah 29:13  
And you will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart.

## Jeremiah 29:14  
I will let Myself be found by you,” declares the Lord, “and I will restore your fortunes and gather you from all the nations and all the places where I have driven you,” declares the Lord,  
“and I will bring you back to the place from where I sent you into exile.”

## Jeremiah 29:15  
“Because you have said, ‘The Lord has raised up prophets for us in Babylon’—

## Jeremiah 29:16  
for this is what the Lord says about the king who sits on the throne of David, and about all the people who live in this city, your brothers who did not go with you into exile—

## Jeremiah 29:17  
this is what the Lord of armies says: ‘Behold, I am sending upon them the sword, famine, and plague;  
and I will make them like rotten figs that are inedible because they are so bad.

## Jeremiah 29:18  
And I will pursue them with the sword, famine, and plague; and I will make them an object of terror to all the kingdoms of the earth,  
to be a curse and an object of horror, hissing, and disgrace among all the nations where I have driven them,

## Jeremiah 29:19  
because they have not listened to My words,’ declares the Lord, ‘which I sent to them again and again by My servants the prophets;  
but you did not listen either,’ declares the Lord.

## Jeremiah 29:20  
Therefore, hear the word of the Lord, all you exiles whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon.

## Jeremiah 29:21  
This is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel says about Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and about Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah,  
who are prophesying a lie to you in My name: ‘Behold, I am going to hand them over to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will kill them before your eyes.

## Jeremiah 29:22  
And a curse will be used of them by all the exiles from Judah who are in Babylon, saying,  
“May the Lord make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire,”

## Jeremiah 29:23  
because they have acted foolishly in Israel, and committed adultery with their neighbors’ wives, and have spoken words in My name falsely, which I did not command them.  
And I am He who knows, and a witness,’ declares the Lord.”

## Jeremiah 29:24  
Now you shall speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,

## Jeremiah 29:25  
“This is what the Lord of armies, the God of Israel says: ‘Because you have sent letters in your own name to all the people who are in Jerusalem,  
to the priest Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, and to all the priests, saying,

## Jeremiah 29:26  
“The Lord has made you priest instead of Jehoiada the priest,  
to be the overseer of the house of the Lord for every madman who prophesies,  
to put him in the stocks and in the iron collar.

## Jeremiah 29:27  
So now, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth who prophesies to you?

## Jeremiah 29:28  
For he has sent word to us in Babylon, saying, ‘The exile will be long; build houses and live in them, and plant gardens and eat their fruit.’”’”

## Jeremiah 29:29  
Now Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet.

## Jeremiah 29:30  
Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah, saying,

## Jeremiah 29:31  
“Send word to all the exiles, saying, ‘This is what the Lord says about Shemaiah the Nehelamite:  
“Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, although I did not send him, and he has made you trust in a lie,”

## Jeremiah 29:32  
therefore, this is what the Lord says: “Behold, I am going to punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his descendants;  
he will not have anyone living among this people,  
and he will not see the good that I am going to do for My people,” declares the Lord,  
“because he has spoken falsely against the Lord.”’
