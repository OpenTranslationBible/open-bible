# Jeremiah Chapter 18

## Jeremiah 18:1  
The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying,

## Jeremiah 18:2  
“Arise and go down to the potter’s house, and there I will announce My words to you.”

## Jeremiah 18:3  
So I went down to the potter’s house, and there he was, making something on the wheel.

## Jeremiah 18:4  
But the vessel that he was making of clay was spoiled in the hand of the potter;  
So he remade it into another vessel, as it pleased the potter to make.

## Jeremiah 18:5  
Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying,

## Jeremiah 18:6  
“Can I not, house of Israel, deal with you as this potter does?” declares the Lord.  
“Behold, like the clay in the potter’s hand, so are you in My hand, house of Israel.

## Jeremiah 18:7  
At one moment I might speak concerning a nation or a kingdom to uproot, to tear down, or to destroy it;

## Jeremiah 18:8  
If that nation against which I have spoken turns from its evil,  
I will relent of the disaster that I planned to bring on it.

## Jeremiah 18:9  
Or at another moment I might speak concerning a nation or a kingdom to build up or to plant it;

## Jeremiah 18:10  
If it does evil in My sight by not obeying My voice,  
Then I will relent of the good with which I promised to bless it.

## Jeremiah 18:11  
“So now, speak to the men of Judah and against the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying,  
‘This is what the Lord says:  
Behold, I am forming a disaster against you and devising a plan against you.  
Oh, turn back, each of you from his evil way, and reform your ways and your deeds!’

## Jeremiah 18:12  
But they will say, ‘It’s hopeless!  
For we are going to follow our own plans,  
And each of us will act according to the stubbornness of his evil heart.’

## Jeremiah 18:13  
Therefore this is what the Lord says:  
‘Ask now among the nations:  
Who has heard anything like this?  
The virgin of Israel  
Has done a most appalling thing.

## Jeremiah 18:14  
Does the snow of Lebanon abandon the rock of the open country?  
Or is the cold flowing water from a foreign land ever dried up?

## Jeremiah 18:15  
For My people have forgotten Me,  
They burn incense to worthless gods  
And they have stumbled in their ways,  
In the ancient roads,  
To walk on paths, not a highway,

## Jeremiah 18:16  
To make their land a desolation,  
An object of perpetual hissing;  
Everyone who passes by it will be appalled  
And shake his head.

## Jeremiah 18:17  
Like an east wind I will scatter them  
Before the enemy;  
I will show them My back and not My face  
On the day of their disaster.’”

## Jeremiah 18:18  
Then they said, “Come, let’s devise plans against Jeremiah.  
Certainly the law is not going to be lost to the priest,  
Nor advice to the sage, nor the divine word to the prophet!  
Come, let’s strike him with our tongue,  
And let’s pay no attention to any of his words.”

## Jeremiah 18:19  
Give Your attention to me, Lord,  
And listen to the voice of my opponents!

## Jeremiah 18:20  
Should good be repaid with evil?  
Yet they have dug a pit for me.  
Remember how I stood before You  
To speak good in their behalf,  
So as to turn Your wrath away from them.

## Jeremiah 18:21  
Therefore, give their children over to famine  
And hand them over to the power of the sword;  
And let their wives become childless and widowed.  
Let their men also be put to death,  
Their young men struck and killed by the sword in battle.

## Jeremiah 18:22  
May a cry be heard from their houses,  
When You suddenly bring raiders upon them;  
For they have dug a pit to capture me  
And hidden snares for my feet.

## Jeremiah 18:23  
But You, Lord, know  
All their deadly schemes against me;  
Do not forgive their wrongdoing  
Or blot out their sin from Your sight.  
But may they be overthrown before You;  
Deal with them in the time of Your anger!
