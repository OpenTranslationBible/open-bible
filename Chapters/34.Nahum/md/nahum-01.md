# Nahum Chapter 1

## Nahum 1:1

The pronouncement of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.

## Nahum 1:2

> A jealous and avenging God is the Lord;  
> The Lord is avenging and wrathful.  
> The Lord takes vengeance on His adversaries,  
> And He reserves wrath for His enemies.

## Nahum 1:3

> The Lord is slow to anger and great in power,  
> And the Lord will by no means leave the guilty unpunished.  
> In the gale and the storm is His way,  
> And clouds are the dust beneath His feet.

## Nahum 1:4

> He rebukes the sea and dries it up;  
> He dries up all the rivers.  
> Bashan and Carmel wither,  
> The blossoms of Lebanon wither.

## Nahum 1:5

> Mountains quake because of Him,  
> And the hills come apart;  
> Indeed the earth is upheaved by His presence,  
> The world and all the inhabitants in it.

## Nahum 1:6

> Who can stand before His indignation?  
> Who can endure the burning of His anger?  
> His wrath gushes forth like fire,  
> And the rocks are broken up by Him.

## Nahum 1:7

> The Lord is good,  
> A stronghold in the day of trouble,  
> And He knows those who take refuge in Him.

## Nahum 1:8

> But with an overflowing flood  
> He will make a complete end of its site,  
> And will pursue His enemies into darkness.

## Nahum 1:9

> Whatever you devise against the Lord,  
> He will make a complete end of it.  
> Distress will not rise up twice.

## Nahum 1:10

> Like tangled thorns,  
> And like those who are drunken with their drink,  
> They are consumed  
> Like stubble completely dried up.

## Nahum 1:11

> From you has gone out  
> One who devises evil against the Lord,  
> A wicked counsellor.

## Nahum 1:12

This is what the Lord says:

> “Though they are at full strength and so they are many,  
> Even so, they will be cut off and pass away.  
> Though I have afflicted you,  
> I will afflict you no longer.

## Nahum 1:13

> So now, I will break his yoke from you,  
> And tear off your shackles.”

## Nahum 1:14

> The Lord has issued a command regarding you:  
> “Your name will no longer be perpetuated.  
> I will eliminate the carved image and the cast metal image  
> From the house of your gods.  
> I will prepare your grave,  
> For you are contemptible.”

## Nahum 1:15

> Behold, on the mountains, the feet of him who brings good news,  
> Who announces peace!  
> Celebrate your feasts, Judah,  
> Pay your vows.  
> For never again will the wicked one pass through you;  
> He is eliminated completely.
