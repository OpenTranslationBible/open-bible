Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made everything the Lord commanded Moses.

The hundred talents of silver were used to cast the bases for the sanctuary and curtain—100 bases from 100 talents, one talent per base.

and the bases for the surrounding courtyard and entrance curtain, as well as all the tent pegs for the tabernacle and the courtyard.
