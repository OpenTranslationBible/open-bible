# Exodus Chapter 5

## Exodus 5:1
Afterward Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Let My people go, so that they may hold a festival to Me in the wilderness.”

## Exodus 5:2
But Pharaoh said, “Who is the Lord, that I should obey His voice and let Israel go? I do not know the Lord, and I will not let Israel go.”

## Exodus 5:3
Then they said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the Lord our God, or He may strike us with plague or sword.”

## Exodus 5:4
But the king of Egypt replied, “Moses and Aaron, why are you taking the people away from their labour? Get back to your work!”

## Exodus 5:5
Pharaoh also said, “Look, the people of the land are now numerous, and you are stopping them from their work.”

## Exodus 5:6
That same day Pharaoh gave this order to the slave drivers and overseers in charge of the people:

## Exodus 5:7
“You are no longer to provide straw for the people to make bricks, as you used to. Let them go and gather straw for themselves.

## Exodus 5:8
But require them to make the same number of bricks as before; do not reduce the quota. They are lazy; that is why they cry, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’

## Exodus 5:9
Make the work harder for the men so they keep working and pay no attention to deceptive words.”

## Exodus 5:10
So the slave drivers and overseers went out and told the people, “This is what Pharaoh says: I will not give you any more straw.

## Exodus 5:11
Go and gather your own straw wherever you can find it, but your workload will not be reduced.”

## Exodus 5:12
So the people scattered throughout Egypt to gather stubble to use as straw.

## Exodus 5:13
The slave drivers kept pressing them, saying, “Complete your work every day, just as when you had straw.”

## Exodus 5:14
Pharaoh’s slave drivers beat the Israelite foremen they had appointed, demanding, “Why haven’t you met your quota of bricks yesterday or today, as before?”

## Exodus 5:15
Then the Israelite foremen went and appealed to Pharaoh: “Why have you treated your servants this way?

## Exodus 5:16
No straw is given to your servants, yet we are told, ‘Make bricks!’ Your servants are being beaten, but the fault lies with your own people.”

## Exodus 5:17
But Pharaoh said, “Lazy! You are lazy! That’s why you say, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to the Lord.’

## Exodus 5:18
Now get to work. You will not be given any straw, yet you must produce your full quota of bricks.”

## Exodus 5:19
The Israelite foremen realised they were in trouble when they were told, “You must not reduce the daily number of bricks.”

## Exodus 5:20
When they left Pharaoh, they found Moses and Aaron waiting to meet them,

## Exodus 5:21
and they said, “May the Lord look on you and judge you! You have made us repulsive to Pharaoh and his officials and put a sword in their hand to kill us.”

## Exodus 5:22
Then Moses returned to the Lord and said, “Lord, why have You brought trouble on this people? Why did You send me?

## Exodus 5:23
Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has brought more harm upon this people, and You have not delivered Your people at all.”
