# Exodus Chapter 19

## Exodus 19:1
On the first day of the third month after the Israelites had left Egypt, they came to the Desert of Sinai.

## Exodus 19:2
After setting out from Rephidim, they entered the Desert of Sinai, and Israel camped there in front of the mountain.

## Exodus 19:3
Then Moses went up to God, and the Lord called to him from the mountain and said, “This is what you are to say to the descendants of Jacob and to tell the people of Israel:

## Exodus 19:4
‘You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt, and how I carried you on eagles’ wings and brought you to Myself.

## Exodus 19:5
Now if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, you will be My treasured possession out of all the nations—for the whole earth is Mine.

## Exodus 19:6
You will be for Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words you are to speak to the Israelites.”

## Exodus 19:7
So Moses went back and summoned the elders of the people and set before them all the words the Lord had commanded him to speak.

## Exodus 19:8
The people all responded together, “We will do everything the Lord has said.” So Moses brought their answer back to the Lord.

## Exodus 19:9
The Lord said to Moses, “I am going to come to you in a dense cloud so the people will hear Me speaking with you and always put their trust in you.” Then Moses told the Lord what the people had said.

## Exodus 19:10
And the Lord said to Moses, “Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow. They must wash their clothes

## Exodus 19:11
and be ready by the third day, for on that day the Lord will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.

## Exodus 19:12
Put limits around the mountain and tell the people: ‘Be careful not to approach the mountain or touch its base. Whoever touches the mountain is to be put to death.

## Exodus 19:13
They are to be stoned or shot with arrows; not a hand is to be laid on them. No person or animal shall be permitted to live.’ Only when the ram’s horn sounds a long blast may they go up to the mountain.”

## Exodus 19:14
After Moses went down the mountain to the people, he consecrated them, and they washed their clothes.

## Exodus 19:15
Then he said to the people, “Prepare yourselves for the third day. Abstain from sexual relations.”

## Exodus 19:16
On the morning of the third day there was thunder and lightning, with a thick cloud over the mountain, and a loud trumpet blast. Everyone in the camp trembled.

## Exodus 19:17
Then Moses led the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain.

## Exodus 19:18
Mount Sinai was covered with smoke, because the Lord descended on it in fire. The smoke billowed up like the smoke from a furnace, and the whole mountain trembled violently.

## Exodus 19:19
As the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and the voice of God answered him.

## Exodus 19:20
The Lord descended to the top of Mount Sinai and called Moses to the top of the mountain. So Moses went up.

## Exodus 19:21
The Lord said to Moses, “Go down and warn the people not to force their way through to see the Lord, or many of them will perish.

## Exodus 19:22
Even the priests who approach the Lord must consecrate themselves, or the Lord will break out against them.”

## Exodus 19:23
Moses said to the Lord, “The people cannot come up Mount Sinai, because You Yourself warned us: ‘Put limits around the mountain and set it apart as holy.’”

## Exodus 19:24
The Lord replied, “Go down and bring Aaron up with you. But the priests and the people must not force their way through or come up to the Lord, or He will break out against them.”

## Exodus 19:25
So Moses went down to the people and told them.
