# Exodus Chapter 18

## Exodus 18:1
Now Jethro, the priest of Midian and father-in-law of Moses, heard of everything God had done for Moses and for His people Israel—how the Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt.

## Exodus 18:2
After Moses had sent away his wife Zipporah, his father-in-law Jethro received her,

## Exodus 18:3
along with her two sons. One was named Gershom, for Moses had said, “I have become a foreigner in a foreign land,”

## Exodus 18:4
and the other was named Eliezer, for he had said, “My father’s God was my helper; He saved me from the sword of Pharaoh.”

## Exodus 18:5
Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, came to him in the wilderness, where he was camped near the mountain of God.

## Exodus 18:6
He sent word to Moses, “I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons.”

## Exodus 18:7
So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, bowed down and kissed him. They greeted each other and went into the tent.

## Exodus 18:8
Moses told his father-in-law everything the Lord had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, and about all the hardships they had faced on the journey and how the Lord had delivered them.

## Exodus 18:9
Jethro was delighted to hear about all the good things the Lord had done for Israel in rescuing them from the hand of the Egyptians.

## Exodus 18:10
He said, “Praise be to the Lord, who rescued you from the hand of the Egyptians and of Pharaoh, and who rescued the people from the hand of the Egyptians.

## Exodus 18:11
Now I know that the Lord is greater than all other gods, for He did this to those who had treated Israel arrogantly.”

## Exodus 18:12
Then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and other sacrifices to God, and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat with Moses’ father-in-law in the presence of God.

## Exodus 18:13
The next day Moses took his seat to serve as judge for the people, and they stood around him from morning till evening.

## Exodus 18:14
When his father-in-law saw all that Moses was doing for the people, he said, “What is this you are doing? Why do you sit alone as judge while all the people stand around you from morning till evening?”

## Exodus 18:15
Moses answered him, “Because the people come to me to seek God’s will.

## Exodus 18:16
Whenever they have a dispute, it is brought to me, and I decide between the parties and inform them of God’s decrees and laws.”

## Exodus 18:17
Moses’ father-in-law replied, “What you are doing is not good.

## Exodus 18:18
You and these people who come to you will only wear yourselves out. The work is too heavy; you cannot handle it alone.

## Exodus 18:19
Listen now to me and I will give you some advice, and may God be with you. You must be the people’s representative before God and bring their disputes to Him.

## Exodus 18:20
Teach them His decrees and instructions, and show them the way they are to live and how they are to behave.

## Exodus 18:21
But select capable men from all the people—men who fear God, trustworthy men who hate dishonest gain—and appoint them as officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens.

## Exodus 18:22
Have them serve as judges for the people at all times, but let them bring every difficult case to you; the simple cases they can decide themselves. That will make your load lighter, because they will share it with you.

## Exodus 18:23
If you do this and God so commands, you will be able to stand the strain, and all these people will go home satisfied.”

## Exodus 18:24
Moses listened to his father-in-law and did everything he said.

## Exodus 18:25
He chose capable men from all Israel and made them leaders over the people, officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens.

## Exodus 18:26
They served as judges for the people at all times. The difficult cases they brought to Moses, but the simple ones they decided themselves.

## Exodus 18:27
Then Moses sent his father-in-law on his way, and Jethro returned to his own land.
