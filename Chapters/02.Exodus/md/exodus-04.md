# Exodus Chapter 4

## Exodus 4:1
Moses answered, “What if they do not believe me or listen to me and say, ‘The Lord did not appear to you’?”

## Exodus 4:2
Then the Lord said to him, “What is that in your hand?” “A staff,” he replied.

## Exodus 4:3
The Lord said, “Throw it on the ground.” So Moses threw it on the ground, and it became a snake, and he ran from it.

## Exodus 4:4
Then the Lord said, “Reach out your hand and take it by the tail.” So Moses reached out and took hold of the snake, and it turned back into a staff.

## Exodus 4:5
“This,” said the Lord, “is so that they may believe that the Lord, the God of their fathers, has appeared to you.”

## Exodus 4:6
Then the Lord said, “Put your hand inside your cloak.” So Moses did, and when he took it out, it was leprous, white as snow.

## Exodus 4:7
“Now put it back into your cloak,” He said. Moses put his hand back in, and when he took it out, it was restored.

## Exodus 4:8
Then the Lord said, “If they do not believe you or pay attention to the first sign, they may believe the second.

## Exodus 4:9
But if they do not believe these two signs or listen to you, take some water from the Nile, pour it on the ground, and it will turn to blood.”

## Exodus 4:10
Moses said to the Lord, “Pardon Your servant, Lord. I have never been eloquent... I am slow of speech and tongue.”

## Exodus 4:11
The Lord said, “Who gave human beings their mouths? Who makes them deaf or mute? Is it not I, the Lord?

## Exodus 4:12
Now go; I will help you speak and will teach you what to say.”

## Exodus 4:13
But Moses said, “Please send someone else.”

## Exodus 4:14
Then the Lord’s anger burned against Moses and He said, “What about your brother Aaron the Levite? I know he can speak well. He is already on his way to meet you.

## Exodus 4:15
You shall speak to him and put words in his mouth; I will help both of you speak and will teach you what to do.

## Exodus 4:16
He will speak to the people for you, and it will be as if he were your mouth and you were God to him.

## Exodus 4:17
But take this staff in your hand so you can perform the signs with it.”

## Exodus 4:18
Then Moses returned to Jethro his father-in-law and said, “Let me return to my people in Egypt.” Jethro said, “Go in peace.”

## Exodus 4:19
Now the Lord had said to Moses in Midian, “Go back to Egypt, for all those who wanted to kill you are dead.”

## Exodus 4:20
So Moses took his wife and sons, put them on a donkey and returned to Egypt, carrying the staff of God.

## Exodus 4:21
The Lord said to Moses, “When you return to Egypt, perform before Pharaoh all the wonders I have given you. But I will harden his heart, so he will not let the people go.

## Exodus 4:22
Then say to Pharaoh, ‘This is what the Lord says: Israel is My firstborn son.

## Exodus 4:23
And I told you, “Let My son go, so he may worship Me.” But you refused, so I will kill your firstborn son.’”

## Exodus 4:24
At a lodging place on the way, the Lord met Moses and was about to kill him.

## Exodus 4:25
But Zipporah took a flint knife, cut off her son’s foreskin and touched Moses’ feet with it. “Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me,” she said.

## Exodus 4:26
So the Lord let him alone. At that time she said “bridegroom of blood,” referring to circumcision.

## Exodus 4:27
The Lord said to Aaron, “Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.” So he met him at the mountain of God and kissed him.

## Exodus 4:28
Then Moses told Aaron everything the Lord had said and about the signs He had commanded him.

## Exodus 4:29
Moses and Aaron brought together all the elders of the Israelites,

## Exodus 4:30
and Aaron told them everything the Lord had said to Moses. He also performed the signs before the people,

## Exodus 4:31
and the people believed. When they heard the Lord was concerned about them and had seen their suffering, they bowed down and worshipped.
