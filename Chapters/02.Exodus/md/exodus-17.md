# Exodus Chapter 17

## Exodus 17:1
The entire Israelite community set out from the Desert of Sin, travelling from place to place as the Lord directed. They camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink.

## Exodus 17:2
So they quarrelled with Moses and said, “Give us water to drink.” Moses replied, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test the Lord?”

## Exodus 17:3
But the people were thirsty for water there, and they grumbled against Moses. They said, “Why did you bring us up out of Egypt to make us and our children and livestock die of thirst?”

## Exodus 17:4
Then Moses cried out to the Lord, “What shall I do with these people? They are almost ready to stone me.”

## Exodus 17:5
The Lord answered Moses, “Go out in front of the people. Take with you some of the elders of Israel and take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile—and go.

## Exodus 17:6
I will stand before you by the rock at Horeb. Strike the rock, and water will come out of it for the people to drink.” So Moses did this in the sight of the elders of Israel.

## Exodus 17:7
And he called the place Massah and Meribah because the Israelites quarrelled and tested the Lord, saying, “Is the Lord among us or not?”

## Exodus 17:8
The Amalekites came and attacked the Israelites at Rephidim.

## Exodus 17:9
Moses said to Joshua, “Choose some of our men and go out to fight the Amalekites. Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand.”

## Exodus 17:10
So Joshua fought the Amalekites as Moses had instructed, and Moses, Aaron and Hur went to the top of the hill.

## Exodus 17:11
As long as Moses held up his hands, the Israelites were winning, but whenever he lowered his hands, the Amalekites were winning.

## Exodus 17:12
When Moses’ hands grew tired, they took a stone and put it under him and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held his hands up—one on each side—so that his hands remained steady until sunset.

## Exodus 17:13
So Joshua overcame the Amalekite army with the sword.

## Exodus 17:14
Then the Lord said to Moses, “Write this on a scroll as something to be remembered and recite it to Joshua, because I will completely blot out the name of Amalek from under heaven.”

## Exodus 17:15
Moses built an altar and called it The Lord is my Banner.

## Exodus 17:16
He said, “Because hands were lifted up against the throne of the Lord, the Lord will be at war against the Amalekites from generation to generation.”
