# Exodus Chapter 31

## Exodus 31:1
Then the Lord said to Moses,

## Exodus 31:2
“See, I have chosen Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,

## Exodus 31:3
and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, understanding, knowledge, and all kinds of craftsmanship—

## Exodus 31:4
to design artistic works in gold, silver, and bronze,

## Exodus 31:5
to cut and set stones, to work in wood, and to engage in all kinds of artistic craftsmanship.

## Exodus 31:6
Moreover, I have appointed Oholiab son of Ahisamak, of the tribe of Dan, to work with him. I have given ability to all the skilled workers to make everything I have commanded you:

## Exodus 31:7
the tent of meeting, the ark of the covenant law with the atonement cover on it, and all the furnishings of the tent—

## Exodus 31:8
the table with its articles, the pure gold lampstand and all its accessories, the altar of incense,

## Exodus 31:9
the altar of burnt offering and all its tools, the basin with its stand—

## Exodus 31:10
and the woven garments, both the sacred garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons when they serve as priests,

## Exodus 31:11
as well as the anointing oil and the fragrant incense for the Holy Place. They are to make them just as I commanded you.”

## Exodus 31:12
Then the Lord said to Moses,

## Exodus 31:13
“Say to the Israelites, ‘You must observe My Sabbaths. This will be a sign between Me and you for the generations to come, so you may know that I am the Lord, who makes you holy.

## Exodus 31:14
Observe the Sabbath, because it is holy to you. Anyone who desecrates it is to be put to death. Anyone who does work on that day must be cut off from their people.

## Exodus 31:15
For six days work may be done, but the seventh is a day of rest, holy to the Lord. Whoever does work on the Sabbath day must be put to death.

## Exodus 31:16
The Israelites are to observe the Sabbath, celebrating it for the generations to come as a lasting covenant.

## Exodus 31:17
It is a sign forever between Me and the Israelites. For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day He rested and was refreshed.’”

## Exodus 31:18
When the Lord finished speaking with Moses on Mount Sinai, He gave him the two tablets of the covenant law, tablets of stone inscribed by the finger of God.
