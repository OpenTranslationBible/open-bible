## Exodus 28:1
Bring your brother Aaron, along with his sons Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar, so they may serve Me as priests.

## Exodus 28:2
Make sacred garments for Aaron to give him dignity and honour.

## Exodus 28:3
Instruct all skilled workers whom I have given ability, that they are to make garments for Aaron to consecrate him as priest.

## Exodus 28:4
These are the garments they shall make: a breastpiece, an ephod, a robe, a tunic with a woven pattern, a turban, and a sash. They are to make these garments for Aaron and his sons to serve Me as priests.

## Exodus 28:5
They shall use gold, and blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and fine linen.

## Exodus 28:6
Make the ephod of gold, blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and fine linen, skillfully woven.

## Exodus 28:7
It must have two shoulder pieces joined together at the two edges.

## Exodus 28:8
Its waistband is to be made in the same style and attached, using the same materials as the ephod itself.

## Exodus 28:9
Take two onyx stones and engrave on them the names of the sons of Israel,

## Exodus 28:10
six names on one stone and the other six on the second stone, in the order of birth.

## Exodus 28:11
Engrave the stones like a seal and mount them in gold settings.

## Exodus 28:12
Attach the stones to the shoulder pieces of the ephod as memorial stones for the sons of Israel. Aaron is to carry their names before the Lord on his shoulders.

## Exodus 28:13
Make gold settings

## Exodus 28:14
and two braided chains of pure gold like cords, and fasten the chains to the settings.

## Exodus 28:15
Make a breastpiece for making decisions, similar in workmanship to the ephod: gold, blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and fine linen.

## Exodus 28:16
It is to be square, folded double, a span long and a span wide.

## Exodus 28:17
Mount four rows of stones on it. The first row: carnelian, chrysolite, and beryl;

## Exodus 28:18
second row: turquoise, lapis lazuli, and emerald;

## Exodus 28:19
third row: jacinth, agate, and amethyst;

## Exodus 28:20
fourth row: topaz, onyx, and jasper. Mount them in gold settings.

## Exodus 28:21
Each of the twelve stones is to represent one of the tribes of Israel, engraved like a seal with the name of one tribe.

## Exodus 28:22
Make chains of pure gold, twisted like cords, for the breastpiece.

## Exodus 28:23
Make two gold rings for the breastpiece and attach them to its top corners.

## Exodus 28:24
Fasten the two gold cords to the rings at the corners of the breastpiece,

## Exodus 28:25
and the other ends of the cords to the gold settings on the shoulder pieces of the ephod.

## Exodus 28:26
Make two more gold rings and attach them to the bottom corners of the breastpiece on the inside edge.

## Exodus 28:27
Then make two more rings for the ephod and fasten them low on the front, near the seam just above the waistband.

## Exodus 28:28
Tie the breastpiece securely with blue cord to the rings of the ephod, so it rests above the waistband and does not swing loose.

## Exodus 28:29
Whenever Aaron enters the Holy Place, he will carry the names of the sons of Israel on the breastpiece over his heart, as a continual memorial before the Lord.

## Exodus 28:30
Place the Urim and Thummim in the breastpiece, so they will be over Aaron’s heart when he enters the Lord’s presence. He will always bear the means of decision for the Israelites over his heart.

## Exodus 28:31
Make the robe of the ephod entirely of blue cloth.

## Exodus 28:32
There must be an opening for the head in its centre, with a reinforced edge like a collar to prevent tearing.

## Exodus 28:33
Make pomegranates of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn around the hem, with gold bells between them.

## Exodus 28:34
Alternate the gold bells and the pomegranates around the hem of the robe.

## Exodus 28:35
Aaron must wear it when he ministers, so the sound of the bells will be heard as he enters and leaves the Holy Place before the Lord, and he will not die.

## Exodus 28:36
Make a plate of pure gold and engrave on it like a seal: HOLY TO THE LORD.

## Exodus 28:37
Fasten it with a blue cord to the turban; it is to be worn on the front.

## Exodus 28:38
It will be on Aaron’s forehead continually, so that he may bear the guilt connected with the sacred offerings. The offering will be acceptable to the Lord.

## Exodus 28:39
Weave the tunic of fine linen, and make the turban also of fine linen. The sash is to be skillfully embroidered.

## Exodus 28:40
Make tunics, sashes, and caps for Aaron’s sons, to give them dignity and honour.

## Exodus 28:41
After putting these garments on Aaron and his sons, anoint and ordain them, and consecrate them to serve Me as priests.

## Exodus 28:42
Make linen undergarments covering from waist to thigh, to be worn whenever they enter the tent of meeting or approach the altar.

## Exodus 28:43
These garments must always be worn, or they will bear guilt and die. This is a lasting ordinance for Aaron and his descendants.
