# Song of Solomon Chapter 5

## Song of Solomon 5:1

I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride;  
I have gathered my myrrh along with my balsam.  
I have eaten my honeycomb and my honey;  
I have drunk my wine and my milk.

Eat, friends;  
Drink and become intoxicated with love.

## Song of Solomon 5:2

I was asleep but my heart was awake.  
A voice! My beloved was knocking:  
“Open to me, my sister, my darling,  
My dove, my perfect one!  
For my head is drenched with dew,  
My locks with the damp of the night.”

## Song of Solomon 5:3

“I have taken off my tunic,  
How can I put it on again?  
I have washed my feet,  
How can I dirty them again?”

## Song of Solomon 5:4

My beloved extended his hand through the opening,  
And my feelings were stirred for him.

## Song of Solomon 5:5

I arose to open to my beloved;  
And my hands dripped with myrrh,  
And my fingers with drops of myrrh,  
On the handles of the bolt.

## Song of Solomon 5:6

I opened to my beloved,  
But my beloved had turned away and had gone!  
My soul failed when he departed.  
I searched for him but did not find him;  
I called him but he did not answer me.

## Song of Solomon 5:7

The watchmen who make the rounds in the city found me,  
They struck me and wounded me;  
The guards of the walls took my shawl away from me.

## Song of Solomon 5:8

I adjure you,  
O daughters of Jerusalem,  
If you find my beloved,  
As to what you will tell him:  
That I am lovesick.

## Song of Solomon 5:9

What kind of beloved is your beloved,  
O most beautiful among women?  
What kind of beloved is your beloved,  
That you make us adjure you?

## Song of Solomon 5:10

My beloved is dazzling and reddish,  
Outstanding among ten thousand.

## Song of Solomon 5:11

His head is like gold, pure gold;  
His locks are like clusters of dates  
And black as a raven.

## Song of Solomon 5:12

His eyes are like doves beside streams of water,  
Bathed in milk,  
And perched in their setting.

## Song of Solomon 5:13

His cheeks are like a garden bed of balsam,  
Banks of fragrant herbs;  
His lips are lilies  
Dripping with drops of myrrh.

## Song of Solomon 5:14

His hands are rods of gold  
Set with topaz;  
His abdomen is carved ivory  
Inlaid with sapphires.

## Song of Solomon 5:15

His legs are pillars of alabaster  
Set on pedestals of pure gold;  
His appearance is like Lebanon,  
Choice as the cedars.

## Song of Solomon 5:16

His mouth is full of sweetness.  
And he is wholly desirable.  
This is my beloved and this is my friend,  
O daughters of Jerusalem.
