# Mark Chapter 14

## Mark 14:1

Now the Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread were two days away;  
and the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to arrest Him covertly and kill Him;

## Mark 14:2

for they were saying,  
“Not during the festival, otherwise there will be a riot of the people.”

---

## Mark 14:3

While He was in Bethany at the home of Simon the Leper,  
and reclining at the table, a woman came with an alabaster vial of very expensive perfume of pure nard.  
She broke the vial and poured the perfume over His head.

## Mark 14:4

But there were some indignantly remarking to one another,  
“Why has this perfume been wasted?

## Mark 14:5

For this perfume could have been sold for over three hundred denarii,  
and the money given to the poor.” And they were scolding her.

## Mark 14:6

But Jesus said,  
“Leave her alone; why are you bothering her? She has done a good deed for Me.

## Mark 14:7

For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want, you can do good for them;  
but you do not always have Me.

## Mark 14:8

She has done what she could; she has anointed My body beforehand for the burial.

## Mark 14:9

Truly I say to you, wherever the gospel is preached in the entire world,  
what this woman has done will also be told in memory of her.”

---

## Mark 14:10

Then Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went to the chief priests  
in order to betray Him to them.

## Mark 14:11

They were delighted when they heard this, and promised to give him money.  
And he began looking for a good opportunity to betray Him.

---

## Mark 14:12

On the first day of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb was being sacrificed,  
His disciples _said to Him_,  
“Where do You want us to go and prepare for You to eat the Passover?”

## Mark 14:13

And He _sent_ two of His disciples and _said to them_,  
“Go into the city, and a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you; follow him.

## Mark 14:14

And wherever he enters, say to the owner of the house,  
‘The Teacher says, “Where is My guest room in which I may eat the Passover with My disciples?”’

## Mark 14:15

And he himself will show you a large upstairs room furnished and ready;  
prepare for us there.”

## Mark 14:16

The disciples left and came to the city, and found everything just as He had told them;  
and they prepared the Passover.

---

## Mark 14:17

When it was evening, He _came_ with the twelve.

## Mark 14:18

And as they were reclining at the table and eating, Jesus said,  
“Truly I say to you that one of you will betray Me—one who is eating with Me.”

## Mark 14:19

They began to be grieved and to say to Him one by one, “Surely it is not I?”

## Mark 14:20

But He _said to them_,  
“It is one of the twelve, the one who dips bread with Me in the bowl.

## Mark 14:21

For the Son of Man is going away just as it is written about Him;  
but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed!  
It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.”

---

## Mark 14:22

While they were eating, He took some bread, and after a blessing, He broke it, and gave it to them, and said,  
“Take it; this is My body.”

## Mark 14:23

And when He had taken a cup and given thanks, He gave it to them, and they all drank from it.

## Mark 14:24

And He _said to them_,  
“This is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many.

## Mark 14:25

Truly I say to you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine again  
until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.”

## Mark 14:26

And after singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.

---

## Mark 14:27

And Jesus _said to them_,

> “You will all fall away, because it is written:  
> ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’

## Mark 14:28

But after I am raised, I will go ahead of you to Galilee.”

## Mark 14:29

But Peter _said to Him_,  
“Even if they all fall away, yet I will not!”

## Mark 14:30

And Jesus _said to him_,  
“Truly I say to you, that this very night, before a rooster crows twice,  
you yourself will deny Me three times.”

## Mark 14:31

But Peter repeatedly _said insistently_,  
“Even if I have to die with You, I will not deny You!”  
And they all were saying the same thing as well.

---

## Mark 14:32

They _came_ to a place named Gethsemane; and He _said to His disciples_,  
“Sit here until I have prayed.”

## Mark 14:33

And He _took_ Peter, James, and John with Him, and began to be deeply distressed and troubled.

## Mark 14:34

And He _said to them_,  
“My soul is deeply grieved, to the point of death; remain here and keep watch.”

## Mark 14:35

And He went a little beyond them, and fell to the ground and began praying  
that if it were possible, the hour might pass Him by.

## Mark 14:36

And He was saying,  
“Abba, Father! All things are possible for You;  
remove this cup from Me; yet not what I will, but what You will.”

## Mark 14:37

And He _came_ and _found them sleeping_, and He _said to Peter_,  
“Simon, are you asleep? Could you not keep watch for one hour?

## Mark 14:38

Keep watching and praying, so that you will not come into temptation;  
the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”

## Mark 14:39

Again He went away and prayed, saying the same words.

## Mark 14:40

And again He came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy;  
and they did not know what to say in reply to Him.

## Mark 14:41

And He _came_ the third time and _said to them_,  
“Are you still sleeping and resting? It is enough; the hour has come;  
behold, the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.

## Mark 14:42

Get up, let’s go; behold, the one who is betraying Me is near!”

---

## Mark 14:43

And immediately, while He was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, _came up_,  
accompanied by a crowd with swords and clubs,  
who were from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders.

## Mark 14:44

Now he who was betraying Him had given them a signal, saying,  
“Whomever I kiss, He is the One; arrest Him and lead Him away under guard.”

## Mark 14:45

And after coming, Judas immediately went to Him and _said_, “Rabbi!” and kissed Him.

## Mark 14:46

And they laid hands on Him and arrested Him.

## Mark 14:47

But one of those who stood by drew his sword and struck the slave of the high priest, and cut off his ear.

## Mark 14:48

And Jesus _responded and said to them_,  
“Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest Me, as you would against a man inciting a revolt?

## Mark 14:49

Every day I was with you within the temple grounds, teaching, and you did not arrest Me;  
but this has taken place so that the Scriptures will be fulfilled.”

## Mark 14:50

And His disciples all left Him and fled.

---

## Mark 14:51

A young man was following Him, wearing nothing but a linen sheet over his naked body;  
and they _seized him_.

## Mark 14:52

But he pulled free of the linen sheet and escaped naked.

---

## Mark 14:53

They led Jesus away to the high priest; and all the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes _gathered together_.

## Mark 14:54

Peter had followed Him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest;  
and he was sitting with the officers and warming himself at the fire.

---

## Mark 14:55

Now the chief priests and the entire Council were trying to obtain testimony against Jesus to put Him to death,  
and they were not finding any.

## Mark 14:56

For many people were giving false testimony against Him, and so their testimonies were not consistent.

## Mark 14:57

And then some stood up and began giving false testimony against Him, saying,

## Mark 14:58

“We heard Him say, ‘I will destroy this temple that was made by hands,  
and in three days I will build another made without hands.’”

## Mark 14:59

And not even in this respect was their testimony consistent.

## Mark 14:60

And then the high priest stood up and came forward and questioned Jesus, saying,  
“Do You not offer any answer for what these men are testifying against You?”

## Mark 14:61

But He kept silent and did not offer any answer.  
Again the high priest was questioning Him, and _said to Him_,  
“Are You the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?”

## Mark 14:62

Jesus _said_,  
“I am; and you shall see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power,  
and coming with the clouds of heaven.”

## Mark 14:63

Tearing his clothes, the high priest _said_,  
“What further need do we have of witnesses?

## Mark 14:64

You have heard the blasphemy; how does it seem to you?”  
And they all condemned Him as deserving of death.

## Mark 14:65

And some began to spit on Him, and to blindfold Him, and to beat Him with their fists and say to Him,  
“Prophesy!” Then the officers took custody of Him and slapped Him in the face.

---

## Mark 14:66

And while Peter was in the courtyard below, one of the slave women of the high priest _came_,

## Mark 14:67

and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him and _said_,  
“You were with Jesus the Nazarene as well.”

## Mark 14:68

But he denied it, saying,  
“I neither know, nor understand what you are talking about.”  
And he went out onto the porch.

## Mark 14:69

The slave woman saw him, and began once more to say to the bystanders,  
“This man is one of them!”

## Mark 14:70

But again he denied it.  
And after a little while, the bystanders were again saying to Peter,  
“You really are one of them, for you are a Galilean as well.”

## Mark 14:71

But he began to curse himself and to swear,  
“I do not know this man of whom you speak!”

## Mark 14:72

And immediately a rooster crowed a second time.  
And Peter remembered how Jesus had made the remark to him,  
“Before a rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times.”  
And he rushed out and wept bitterly.
