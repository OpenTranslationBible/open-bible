# Mark Chapter 13

## Mark 13:1

As He was going out of the temple, one of His disciples _said to Him_,  
“Teacher, look! What wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings!”

## Mark 13:2

And Jesus _said to him_,  
“Do you see these great buildings?  
Not one stone will be left upon another, which will not be torn down.”

## Mark 13:3

As He was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple,  
Peter, James, John, and Andrew were questioning Him privately,

## Mark 13:4

“Tell us, when will these things come about,  
and what will be the sign when all these things are going to be fulfilled?”

## Mark 13:5

And Jesus began to say to them,  
“See to it that no one misleads you.

## Mark 13:6

Many will come in My name, saying, ‘I am He!’ and they will mislead many.

## Mark 13:7

And when you hear of wars and rumours of wars, do not be alarmed;  
those things must take place, but that is not yet the end.

## Mark 13:8

For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom;  
there will be earthquakes in various places; there will also be famines.  
These things are merely the beginning of birth pains.

## Mark 13:9

“But be on your guard; for they will hand you over to the courts,  
and you will be flogged in the synagogues,  
and you will stand before governors and kings on My account, as a testimony to them.

## Mark 13:10

And the gospel must first be preached to all the nations.

## Mark 13:11

And when they arrest you and hand you over, do not worry beforehand about what you are to say,  
but say whatever is given you at that time; for you are not the ones speaking, but it is the Holy Spirit.

## Mark 13:12

And brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child;  
and children will rise up against parents and have them put to death.

## Mark 13:13

And you will be hated by all because of My name,  
but it is the one who has endured to the end who will be saved.

---

## Mark 13:14

“But when you see the abomination of desolation standing where it should not be  
(let the reader understand),  
then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains.

## Mark 13:15

Whoever is on the housetop must not go down, nor go in to get anything out of his house;

## Mark 13:16

and whoever is in the field must not turn back to get his cloak.

## Mark 13:17

But woe to those women who are pregnant, and to those who are nursing babies in those days!

## Mark 13:18

Moreover, pray that it will not happen in winter.

## Mark 13:19

For those days will be a time of tribulation such as has not occurred since the beginning of the creation  
which God created until now, and never will again.

## Mark 13:20

And if the Lord had not shortened those days, no life would have been saved;  
but for the sake of the elect, whom He chose, He shortened the days.

---

## Mark 13:21

And then if anyone says to you, ‘Behold, here is the Christ’; or, ‘Behold, He is there’; do not believe it;

## Mark 13:22

for false christs and false prophets will arise,  
and will provide signs and wonders, in order to mislead, if possible, the elect.

## Mark 13:23

But beware; I have told you everything in advance.

---

## Mark 13:24

“But in those days, after that tribulation,

> the sun will be darkened,
> and the moon will not give its light,

## Mark 13:25

> and the stars will be falling from heaven,
> and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken.

## Mark 13:26

And then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.

## Mark 13:27

And then He will send forth the angels, and will gather together His elect from the four winds,  
from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.

---

## Mark 13:28

“Now learn the parable from the fig tree:  
as soon as its branch has become tender and sprouts its leaves, you know that summer is near.

## Mark 13:29

So you too, when you see these things happening,  
recognise that He is near, right at the door.

## Mark 13:30

Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.

## Mark 13:31

Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will not pass away.

---

## Mark 13:32

“But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone.

## Mark 13:33

Watch out, stay alert; for you do not know when the appointed time is.

## Mark 13:34

It is like a man away on a journey, who upon leaving his house, puts his slaves in charge,  
assigning each one his task, and also commands the doorkeeper to stay alert.

## Mark 13:35

Therefore, stay alert—for you do not know when the master of the house is coming,  
whether in the evening, at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or in the morning—

## Mark 13:36

so that he does not come suddenly and find you asleep.

## Mark 13:37

What I say to you I say to all: ‘Stay alert!’”
