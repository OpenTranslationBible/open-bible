# Mark Chapter 15

## Mark 15:1

Early in the morning, the chief priests with the elders, scribes, and the entire Council  
immediately held a consultation; and they bound Jesus and led Him away, and turned Him over to Pilate.

## Mark 15:2

And Pilate questioned Him,  
“Are You the King of the Jews?”  
And He _answered him_, “It is as you say.”

## Mark 15:3

And the chief priests started accusing Him of many things.

## Mark 15:4

But Pilate was questioning Him again, saying,  
“Do You offer nothing in answer? See how many charges they are bringing against You!”

## Mark 15:5

But Jesus still offered no answer, so Pilate was amazed.

## Mark 15:6

Now at the Passover Feast he used to release for them any one prisoner whom they requested.

## Mark 15:7

And the one named Barabbas had been imprisoned with the rebels  
who had committed murder in the rebellion.

## Mark 15:8

And the crowd went up and began asking Pilate to do as he had been accustomed to do for them.

## Mark 15:9

Pilate answered them, saying,  
“Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?”

## Mark 15:10

For he was aware that the chief priests had handed Him over because of envy.

## Mark 15:11

But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to ask him to release Barabbas for them instead.

## Mark 15:12

And responding again, Pilate said to them,  
“Then what shall I do with Him whom you call the King of the Jews?”

## Mark 15:13

They shouted back, “Crucify Him!”

## Mark 15:14

But Pilate said to them, “Why, what evil has He done?”  
But they shouted all the more, “Crucify Him!”

## Mark 15:15

Intent on satisfying the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas for them,  
and after having Jesus flogged, he handed Him over to be crucified.

## Mark 15:16

Now the soldiers took Him away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium),  
and they _called together_ the whole Roman cohort.

## Mark 15:17

And they _dressed Him_ in purple, and after twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on Him;

## Mark 15:18

and they began saluting Him: “Hail, King of the Jews!”

## Mark 15:19

And they repeatedly beat His head with a reed and spit on Him, and kneeling, they bowed down before Him.

## Mark 15:20

And after they had mocked Him, they took the purple cloak off Him and put His own garments on Him.  
And they _led Him out_ to crucify Him.

---

## Mark 15:21

And they _compelled a passer-by_, coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene  
(the father of Alexander and Rufus), to carry His cross.

## Mark 15:22

Then they _brought Him_ to the place Golgotha, which is translated, Place of a Skull.

## Mark 15:23

And they tried to give Him wine mixed with myrrh; but He did not take it.

## Mark 15:24

And they crucified Him, and _divided up His garments among themselves_, casting lots for them  
to decide what each man would take.

## Mark 15:25

Now it was the third hour when they crucified Him.

## Mark 15:26

The inscription of the charge against Him read,  
“THE KING OF THE JEWS.”

## Mark 15:27

And they _crucified two rebels_ with Him, one on His right and one on His left.

## Mark 15:28

[And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “And He was numbered with transgressors.”]

## Mark 15:29

Those passing by were hurling abuse at Him, shaking their heads and saying,  
“Ha! You who are going to destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days,

## Mark 15:30

save Yourself by coming down from the cross!”

## Mark 15:31

In the same way, the chief priests also, along with the scribes, were mocking Him among themselves and saying,  
“He saved others; He cannot save Himself!

## Mark 15:32

Let this Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross,  
so that we may see and believe!”  
Those who were crucified with Him were also insulting Him.

## Mark 15:33

When the sixth hour came, darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour.

## Mark 15:34

At the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice,  
“Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?” which is translated,  
“My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?”

## Mark 15:35

And when some of the bystanders heard Him, they began saying,  
“Look! He is calling for Elijah!”

## Mark 15:36

And someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a reed, and gave Him a drink, saying,  
“Let us see if Elijah comes to take Him down.”

## Mark 15:37

But Jesus let out a loud cry, and died.

## Mark 15:38

And the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.

## Mark 15:39

And when the centurion, who was standing right in front of Him, saw that He died in this way, he said,  
“Truly this man was the Son of God!”

## Mark 15:40

There were also some women watching from a distance,  
among whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the Less and Joses, and Salome.

## Mark 15:41

When He was in Galilee, they used to follow Him and serve Him;  
and there were many other women who came up with Him to Jerusalem.

## Mark 15:42

Now when evening had already come, since it was the preparation day (that is, the day before the Sabbath),

## Mark 15:43

Joseph of Arimathea came, a prominent member of the Council,  
who was himself also waiting for the kingdom of God;  
and he gathered up courage and went in before Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.

## Mark 15:44

Now Pilate wondered if He was already dead, and summoning the centurion,  
he questioned him as to whether He was already dead.

## Mark 15:45

And after learning this from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.

## Mark 15:46

Joseph bought a linen cloth, took Him down, wrapped Him in the linen cloth,  
and laid Him in a tomb which had been cut out in the rock; and he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.

## Mark 15:47

Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses were watching to see where He was laid.
