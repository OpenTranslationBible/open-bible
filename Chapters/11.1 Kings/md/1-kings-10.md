# 1 Kings Chapter 10

## 1 Kings 10:1

Now when the queen of Sheba heard about the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the Lord,  
she came to test him with difficult questions.

## 1 Kings 10:2

She came to Jerusalem with a very large entourage,  
with camels carrying spices, and very much gold, and precious stones.  
When she came to Solomon, she spoke with him about all that was in her heart.

## 1 Kings 10:3

Solomon answered all her questions;  
nothing was hidden from the king which he did not explain to her.

## 1 Kings 10:4

When the queen of Sheba saw all the wisdom of Solomon,  
the house that he had built,

## 1 Kings 10:5

the food on his table,  
the seating of his servants,  
the attendance of his ministers and their attire,  
his cupbearers,  
and his stairway by which he went up to the house of the Lord,  
there was no more spirit in her.

## 1 Kings 10:6

Then she said to the king,  
“The report which I heard in my own land about your words and your wisdom was true.

## 1 Kings 10:7

But I did not believe the reports until I came and saw with my own eyes.  
And behold, the half was not told to me!  
You exceed in wisdom and prosperity the report which I heard.

## 1 Kings 10:8

Blessed are your men,  
blessed are these servants who stand before you continually and hear your wisdom.

## 1 Kings 10:9

Blessed be the Lord your God,  
who delighted in you to set you on the throne of Israel!  
Because the Lord loved Israel forever,  
He made you king, to do justice and righteousness.”

## 1 Kings 10:10

Then she gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold,  
a very great amount of spices, and precious stones.  
Never again did such abundance of spices come as that which the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.

## 1 Kings 10:11

Also the ships of Hiram, which brought gold from Ophir,  
brought from Ophir a very great quantity of almug wood and precious stones.

## 1 Kings 10:12

The king made from the almug wood supports for the house of the Lord and for the king’s house,  
lyres also and harps for the singers;  
such almug wood has not come in again nor been seen to this day.

## 1 Kings 10:13

King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all she desired, whatever she requested,  
besides what he gave her from his royal bounty.  
Then she turned and went to her own land, she and her servants.

## 1 Kings 10:14

Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold,

## 1 Kings 10:15

besides that from the traders and the wares of the merchants  
and all the kings of the Arabs and the governors of the land.

## 1 Kings 10:16

King Solomon made two hundred large shields of beaten gold,  
six hundred shekels of gold went into each shield.

## 1 Kings 10:17

And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold,  
three minas of gold went into each shield;  
and the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.

## 1 Kings 10:18

Moreover, the king made a great throne of ivory  
and overlaid it with refined gold.

## 1 Kings 10:19

There were six steps to the throne and a round top to the throne at its rear,  
and arms on each side of the seat,  
and two lions standing beside the arms.

## 1 Kings 10:20

Twelve lions were standing there on the six steps, one on each side;  
nothing like it was made for any other kingdom.

## 1 Kings 10:21

All of King Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold,  
and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold.  
None was of silver; it was not considered valuable in the days of Solomon.

## 1 Kings 10:22

For the king had at sea the ships of Tarshish with the ships of Hiram;  
once every three years the ships of Tarshish came,  
bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.

## 1 Kings 10:23

So King Solomon became greater than all the kings of the earth in wealth and in wisdom.

## 1 Kings 10:24

All the earth was seeking the presence of Solomon,  
to hear his wisdom which God had put in his heart.

## 1 Kings 10:25

And they brought every man his gift: articles of silver and gold, garments, weapons, spices, horses, and mules,  
so much year by year.

## 1 Kings 10:26

Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen;  
he had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen,  
and he stationed them in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.

## 1 Kings 10:27

The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones,  
and he made cedars as plentiful as sycamores in the lowland.

## 1 Kings 10:28

Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt and from Kue;  
the king’s traders acquired them from Kue for a price.

## 1 Kings 10:29

A chariot was imported from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver,  
and a horse for one hundred and fifty;  
and by their means they exported them to all the kings of the Hittites and to the kings of Aram.
