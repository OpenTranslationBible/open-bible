# 1 Kings Chapter 15

## 1 Kings 15:1

Now in the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, the son of Nebat,  
Abijam became king over Judah.

## 1 Kings 15:2

He reigned for three years in Jerusalem,  
and his mother’s name was Maacah, the daughter of Abishalom.

## 1 Kings 15:3

He walked in all the sins of his father which he had committed before him,  
and his heart was not wholly devoted to the Lord his God,  
like the heart of his father David.

## 1 Kings 15:4

But for David’s sake the Lord his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem,  
to raise up his son after him and to establish Jerusalem;

## 1 Kings 15:5

because David did what was right in the sight of the Lord,  
and did not turn aside from anything that He commanded him all the days of his life,  
except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.

## 1 Kings 15:6

And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.

## 1 Kings 15:7

Now the rest of the acts of Abijam and all that he did,  
are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?  
And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.

## 1 Kings 15:8

And Abijam lay down with his fathers,  
and they buried him in the city of David;  
and his son Asa became king in his place.

## 1 Kings 15:9

Now in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel,  
Asa became king over Judah.

## 1 Kings 15:10

He reigned for forty-one years in Jerusalem,  
and his mother’s name was Maacah, the daughter of Abishalom.

## 1 Kings 15:11

Asa did what was right in the sight of the Lord,  
like his father David.

## 1 Kings 15:12

He also removed the male cult prostitutes from the land,  
and removed all the idols which his fathers had made.

## 1 Kings 15:13

And he also removed Maacah his mother from the position of queen mother,  
because she had made a horrid image as an Asherah;  
and Asa cut down her horrid image and burned it at the brook Kidron.

## 1 Kings 15:14

But the high places were not eliminated;  
nevertheless, the heart of Asa was wholly devoted to the Lord all his days.

## 1 Kings 15:15

And he brought into the house of the Lord  
the holy offerings of his father and his own holy offerings:  
silver, gold, and utensils.

## 1 Kings 15:16

Now there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.

## 1 Kings 15:17

And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah  
and fortified Ramah,  
to prevent anyone from going out or coming in to Asa king of Judah.

## 1 Kings 15:18

Then Asa took all the silver and the gold  
that were left in the treasuries of the house of the Lord and the treasuries of the king’s house,  
and handed them over to his servants;  
and King Asa sent them to Ben-hadad the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Aram,  
who lived in Damascus, saying,

## 1 Kings 15:19

“Let there be a treaty between you and me,  
as between my father and your father.  
Behold, I have sent you a gift of silver and gold.  
Go, break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, so that he will withdraw from me.”

## 1 Kings 15:20

So Ben-hadad listened to King Asa  
and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel,  
and they conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel-beth-maacah,  
all Chinneroth, besides all the land of Naphtali.

## 1 Kings 15:21

When Baasha heard about it,  
he stopped fortifying Ramah and remained in Tirzah.

## 1 Kings 15:22

Then King Asa made a proclamation to all Judah—none was exempt—  
and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber with which Baasha had built,  
and King Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin and Mizpah.

---

## 1 Kings 15:23

Now as for all the acts of Asa and all his might and everything that he did,  
and the cities which he built,  
are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?  
But in the time of his old age he suffered from a disease in his feet.

## 1 Kings 15:24

And Asa lay down with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of his father David;  
and his son Jehoshaphat became king in his place.

---

## 1 Kings 15:25

Now Nadab the son of Jeroboam became king over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah,  
and he reigned over Israel for two years.

## 1 Kings 15:26

He did evil in the sight of the Lord,  
and walked in the way of his father and in his sin into which he misled Israel.

## 1 Kings 15:27

Then Baasha the son of Ahijah of the house of Issachar conspired against him,  
and Baasha struck him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines,  
while Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon.

## 1 Kings 15:28

So Baasha killed him in the third year of Asa king of Judah,  
and reigned in his place.

## 1 Kings 15:29

And as soon as he became king,  
he struck down all the household of Jeroboam.  
He did not leave to Jeroboam anyone alive,  
but wiped them out completely,  
according to the word of the Lord, which He had spoken through His servant Ahijah the Shilonite,

## 1 Kings 15:30

because of the sins of Jeroboam,  
which he committed, and into which he misled Israel,  
because of his provocation with which he provoked the Lord God of Israel to anger.

---

## 1 Kings 15:31

Now as for the rest of the acts of Nadab and everything that he did,  
are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

## 1 Kings 15:32

And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.

---

## 1 Kings 15:33

In the third year of Asa king of Judah,  
Baasha the son of Ahijah became king over all Israel at Tirzah,  
and reigned for twenty-four years.

## 1 Kings 15:34

He did evil in the sight of the Lord,  
and walked in the way of Jeroboam and in his sin into which he misled Israel.
