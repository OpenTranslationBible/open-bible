# 1 Kings Chapter 22

## 1 Kings 22:1

For three years there was no war between Aram and Israel.

## 1 Kings 22:2

But in the third year, Jehoshaphat king of Judah went down to see the king of Israel.

## 1 Kings 22:3

The king of Israel said to his servants, “Don’t you know that Ramoth-gilead belongs to us? Yet we are doing nothing to take it back from the king of Aram.”

## 1 Kings 22:4

So he asked Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me to fight at Ramoth-gilead?”  
Jehoshaphat answered the king of Israel, “I am as you are; my people as your people, my horses as your horses.”

---

## 1 Kings 22:5

But Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “First, seek the word of the Lord.”

## 1 Kings 22:6

So the king of Israel brought together the prophets—about four hundred men—and asked them, “Shall I go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or shall I refrain?”  
They answered, “Go, for the Lord will give it into the hand of the king.”

## 1 Kings 22:7

But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there not still a prophet of the Lord here whom we may inquire of?”

## 1 Kings 22:8

The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is still one man through whom we can inquire of the Lord, but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good about me—only disaster. He is Micaiah son of Imlah.”  
Jehoshaphat replied, “The king should not speak like that.”

## 1 Kings 22:9

So the king of Israel called an officer and said, “Bring Micaiah son of Imlah at once.”

---

## 1 Kings 22:10

Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting on their thrones, arrayed in robes at the threshing floor by the entrance to the gate of Samaria, with all the prophets prophesying before them.

## 1 Kings 22:11

Zedekiah son of Kenaanah had made iron horns, and he said, “This is what the Lord says: With these you will gore the Arameans until they are destroyed.”

## 1 Kings 22:12

All the prophets were prophesying the same thing: “Go up to Ramoth-gilead and triumph, for the Lord will give it into the king’s hand.”

---

## 1 Kings 22:13

The messenger who went to call Micaiah told him, “Look, the words of the prophets are all in agreement, promising success to the king. Let your word be like theirs, and speak favourably.”

## 1 Kings 22:14

But Micaiah said, “As surely as the Lord lives, I will say only what the Lord tells me.”

---

## 1 Kings 22:15

When he arrived before the king, the king asked him, “Micaiah, shall we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or not?”  
He answered, “Go and triumph, for the Lord will give it into the hand of the king.”

## 1 Kings 22:16

But the king said to him, “How many times must I make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord?”

## 1 Kings 22:17

Then Micaiah said,  
“I saw all Israel scattered on the hills, like sheep without a shepherd,

> and the Lord said, ‘These people have no master; let each of them return to his home in peace.’”

---

## 1 Kings 22:18

The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Did I not tell you that he would prophesy nothing good about me, but only calamity?”

## 1 Kings 22:19

Micaiah said, “Therefore hear the word of the Lord:  
I saw the Lord sitting on His throne, with all the host of heaven standing by Him, on His right and on His left.

## 1 Kings 22:20

And the Lord said, ‘Who will entice Ahab to go and fall at Ramoth-gilead?’  
One suggested this, and another that.

## 1 Kings 22:21

Then a spirit came forward, stood before the Lord, and said, ‘I will entice him.’

## 1 Kings 22:22

‘How?’ the Lord asked.  
‘By being a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets,’ he said.  
The Lord said, ‘You shall succeed in enticing him. Go and do it.’

## 1 Kings 22:23

So now the Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours.  
The Lord has decreed disaster for you.”

---

## 1 Kings 22:24

Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah approached Micaiah and struck him on the cheek.  
He said, “Which way did the spirit of the Lord go from me to speak to you?”

## 1 Kings 22:25

Micaiah replied, “You will find out on the day you go to hide in an inner room.”

## 1 Kings 22:26

The king of Israel ordered, “Take Micaiah and send him back to Amon, the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son,

## 1 Kings 22:27

and say, ‘This is what the king says: Put this man in prison and give him nothing but bread and water until I return safely.’”

## 1 Kings 22:28

But Micaiah declared, “If you ever return safely, then the Lord has not spoken through me.”  
And he added, “Take note, all you people!”

---

## 1 Kings 22:29

So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.

## 1 Kings 22:30

The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself when I go into battle, but you wear your royal robes.”  
So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.

## 1 Kings 22:31

Now the king of Aram had ordered his thirty-two chariot commanders, “Do not fight with anyone, small or great, except the king of Israel.”

## 1 Kings 22:32

When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they thought, “Surely this is the king of Israel.” So they turned to attack him, but Jehoshaphat cried out.

## 1 Kings 22:33

When the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel, they turned away from him.

---

## 1 Kings 22:34

But someone drew his bow at random and struck the king of Israel between the joints of his armour.  
He said to the driver of his chariot, “Turn around and get me out of the battle, for I am wounded.”

## 1 Kings 22:35

The battle raged that day, and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans.  
But the blood from his wound flowed onto the floor of the chariot, and that evening he died.

## 1 Kings 22:36

At sunset, a cry went throughout the army: “Every man to his own city, and every man to his own land!”

## 1 Kings 22:37

So the king died and was brought to Samaria, and they buried him there.

## 1 Kings 22:38

They washed the chariot at a pool in Samaria, where the prostitutes bathed, and the dogs licked up his blood, just as the word of the Lord had spoken.

---

## 1 Kings 22:39

Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all he did—the ivory palace he built and the cities he fortified—are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

## 1 Kings 22:40

Ahab rested with his ancestors, and his son Ahaziah became king in his place.

---

## 1 Kings 22:41

Jehoshaphat son of Asa became king over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.

## 1 Kings 22:42

Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem for twenty-five years. His mother’s name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi.

## 1 Kings 22:43

He followed in the ways of his father Asa and did not stray from them; he did what was right in the eyes of the Lord.  
Yet the high places were not removed, and the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there.

## 1 Kings 22:44

Jehoshaphat also made peace with the king of Israel.

---

## 1 Kings 22:45

As for the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, the mighty deeds he performed and the battles he fought—are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?

## 1 Kings 22:46

He removed from the land the rest of the male cult prostitutes who remained from the days of his father Asa.

## 1 Kings 22:47

There was no king in Edom; a deputy ruled in place of a king.

## 1 Kings 22:48

Jehoshaphat built ships of Tarshish to sail for Ophir for gold, but they never set sail, for they were wrecked at Ezion-geber.

## 1 Kings 22:49

At that time, Ahaziah son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “Let my men sail with yours,” but Jehoshaphat refused.

---

## 1 Kings 22:50

Jehoshaphat rested with his ancestors and was buried with them in the city of his father David.  
And his son Jehoram became king in his place.

---

## 1 Kings 22:51

Ahaziah son of Ahab became king of Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel for two years.

## 1 Kings 22:52

He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord and walked in the ways of his father and mother and in the way of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin.

## 1 Kings 22:53

He served and worshipped Baal and provoked the Lord, the God of Israel, to anger, just as his father had done.
