# 1 Kings Chapter 9

## 1 Kings 9:1

Now it came about when Solomon had finished building the house of the Lord,  
and the king’s house,  
and all that Solomon desired to do,

## 1 Kings 9:2

that the Lord appeared to Solomon a second time,  
just as He had appeared to him at Gibeon.

## 1 Kings 9:3

And the Lord said to him,  
“I have heard your prayer and your plea which you have made before Me;  
I have consecrated this house which you have built,  
by putting My name there forever,  
and My eyes and My heart will be there always.

## 1 Kings 9:4

As for you, if you will walk before Me  
as your father David walked, in integrity of heart and uprightness,  
to do in accordance with everything that I have commanded you,  
and will keep My statutes and My ordinances,

## 1 Kings 9:5

then I will establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever,  
just as I promised to your father David, saying,  
‘You shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel.’

## 1 Kings 9:6

But if you or your sons indeed turn away from following Me,  
and do not keep My commandments and My statutes which I have placed before you,  
and you go and serve other gods and worship them,

## 1 Kings 9:7

then I will cut Israel off from the land which I have given them,  
and the house which I have consecrated for My name,  
I will expel from My sight.  
So Israel will become a proverb and an object of ridicule among all peoples.

## 1 Kings 9:8

And this house will become a heap of ruins;  
everyone who passes by it will be appalled and hiss and say,  
‘Why has the Lord done such a thing to this land and to this house?’

## 1 Kings 9:9

And they will say,  
‘Because they abandoned the Lord their God,  
who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt,  
and they adopted other gods and worshipped and served them;  
therefore the Lord has brought all this adversity upon them.’”

## 1 Kings 9:10

Now it came about at the end of twenty years,  
in which Solomon had built the two houses,  
the house of the Lord and the king’s house,

## 1 Kings 9:11

Hiram king of Tyre had supplied Solomon with cedar and cypress timber and gold  
according to all his desire,  
then King Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.

## 1 Kings 9:12

So Hiram came from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him,  
but they did not please him.

## 1 Kings 9:13

And he said, “What are these cities which you have given me, my brother?”  
So he called them the land of Cabul to this day.

## 1 Kings 9:14

And Hiram sent to the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold.

## 1 Kings 9:15

Now this is the account of the forced labour  
which King Solomon conscripted to build the house of the Lord,  
his own house, the Millo, the wall of Jerusalem,  
Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer.

## 1 Kings 9:16

Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and captured Gezer,  
and burned it with fire,  
and had killed the Canaanites who lived in the city,  
and had given it as a dowry to his daughter, Solomon’s wife.

## 1 Kings 9:17

So Solomon rebuilt Gezer,  
and Lower Beth-horon,

## 1 Kings 9:18

Baalath and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land of Judah,

## 1 Kings 9:19

and all the storage cities which Solomon had,  
the cities for his chariots and for his horsemen,  
and everything that it pleased Solomon to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon,  
and in all the land under his dominion.

## 1 Kings 9:20

As for all the people who were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites,  
the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the sons of Israel,

## 1 Kings 9:21

their descendants who were left after them in the land,  
whom the sons of Israel were unable to completely eliminate,  
Solomon imposed forced labour on them to this day.

## 1 Kings 9:22

But Solomon did not make slaves from the sons of Israel;  
they were men of war, his servants, his commanders, his captains,  
chariot commanders, and his horsemen.

## 1 Kings 9:23

These were the chief officers who were over Solomon’s work, five hundred and fifty,  
who ruled over the people doing the work.

---

## 1 Kings 9:24

As soon as Pharaoh’s daughter came up from the city of David to her house  
which Solomon had built for her,  
then he built the Millo.

## 1 Kings 9:25

Now three times a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings  
on the altar which he built to the Lord,  
burning incense with them on the altar which was before the Lord.  
So he finished the house.

## 1 Kings 9:26

King Solomon also built a fleet of ships at Ezion-geber,  
which is near Eloth on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.

## 1 Kings 9:27

And Hiram sent his servants with the fleet,  
sailors who knew the sea,  
along with Solomon’s servants.

## 1 Kings 9:28

They went to Ophir and took four hundred and twenty talents of gold from there,  
and brought it to King Solomon.
