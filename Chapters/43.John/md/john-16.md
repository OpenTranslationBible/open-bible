# John Chapter 16

## John 16:1

“These things I have spoken to you so that you will not be led into sin.

## John 16:2

They will ban you from the synagogue,  
yet an hour is coming for everyone who kills you to think that he is offering a service to God.

## John 16:3

These things they will do because they have not known the Father nor Me.

## John 16:4

But these things I have spoken to you, so that when their hour comes,  
you may remember that I told you of them.  
However, I did not say these things to you at the beginning, because I was with you.

## John 16:5

“But now I am going to Him who sent Me; and none of you asks Me, ‘Where are You going?’

## John 16:6

But because I have said these things to you, grief has filled your heart.

## John 16:7

But I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I am leaving;  
for if I do not leave, the Helper will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you.

## John 16:8

And He, when He comes, will convict the world regarding sin, and righteousness, and judgment:

## John 16:9

regarding sin, because they do not believe in Me;

## John 16:10

and regarding righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you no longer are going to see Me;

## John 16:11

and regarding judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.

---

## John 16:12

“I have many more things to say to you, but you cannot bear them at the present time.

## John 16:13

But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes,  
He will guide you into all the truth;  
for He will not speak on His own, but whatever He hears, He will speak;  
and He will disclose to you what is to come.

## John 16:14

He will glorify Me, for He will take from Mine and will disclose it to you.

## John 16:15

All things that the Father has are Mine;  
this is why I said that He takes from Mine and will disclose it to you.

---

## John 16:16

“A little while, and you will no longer see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me.”

## John 16:17

So some of His disciples said to one another,  
“What is this that He is telling us,  
‘A little while, and you will not see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me’;  
and, ‘because I am going to the Father’?”

## John 16:18

So they were saying, “What is this that He says, ‘A little while’?  
We do not know what He is talking about.”

---

## John 16:19

Jesus knew that they wanted to question Him, and He said to them,  
“Are you deliberating together about this, that I said,  
‘A little while, and you will not see Me; and again a little while, and you will see Me’?

## John 16:20

Truly, truly I say to you that you will weep and mourn, but the world will rejoice;  
you will grieve, but your grief will be turned into joy.

## John 16:21

Whenever a woman is in labour, she has pain, because her hour has come;  
but when she gives birth to the child, she no longer remembers the suffering,  
because of the joy that a child has been born into the world.

## John 16:22

Therefore you too have grief now;  
but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one is going to take your joy away from you.

---

## John 16:23

And on that day you will not question Me about anything.  
Truly, truly I say to you, if you ask the Father for anything in My name, He will give it to you.

## John 16:24

Until now you have asked for nothing in My name; ask and you will receive, so that your joy may be made full.

---

## John 16:25

“These things I have spoken to you in figures of speech;  
an hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures,  
but will tell you plainly about the Father.

## John 16:26

On that day you will ask in My name,  
and I am not saying to you that I will request of the Father on your behalf;

## John 16:27

for the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me, and have believed that I came forth from the Father.

## John 16:28

I came forth from the Father and have come into the world;  
again, I am leaving the world and going to the Father.”

---

## John 16:29

His disciples _said_, “See, now You are speaking plainly and not using any figure of speech!

## John 16:30

Now we know that You know all things, and that You have no need for anyone to question You;  
this is why we believe that You came from God.”

## John 16:31

Jesus replied to them,  
“Do you now believe?

## John 16:32

Behold, an hour is coming, and has already come, for you to be scattered,  
each to his own home, and to leave Me alone;  
and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me.

## John 16:33

These things I have spoken to you so that in Me you may have peace.  
In the world you have tribulation, but take courage; I have overcome the world.”
