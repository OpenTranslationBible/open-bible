# John Chapter 21

## John 21:1

After these things Jesus revealed Himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias,  
and He revealed Himself in this way:

## John 21:2

Simon Peter, Thomas who was called Didymus, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee,  
the sons of Zebedee, and two others of His disciples were together.

## John 21:3

Simon Peter _said to them_, “I am going fishing.”  
They _said to him_, “We are also coming with you.”  
They went out and got into the boat; and that night they caught nothing.

## John 21:4

But when the day was now breaking, Jesus stood on the beach;  
yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.

## John 21:5

So Jesus _said to them_, “Children, you do not have any fish to eat, do you?”  
They answered Him, “No.”

## John 21:6

And He _said to them_, “Cast the net on the right-hand side of the boat, and you will find the fish.”  
So they cast it, and then they were not able to haul it in because of the great quantity of fish.

## John 21:7

Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved _said to Peter_, “It is the Lord!”  
So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment (for he had stripped for work),  
and threw himself into the sea.

## John 21:8

But the other disciples came in the little boat, for they were not far from the land,  
but about two hundred cubits away, dragging the net full of fish.

## John 21:9

So when they got out on the land, they _saw_ a charcoal fire already made and fish placed on it, and bread.

## John 21:10

Jesus _said to them_, “Bring some of the fish which you have now caught.”

## John 21:11

So Simon Peter went up and hauled the net to land, full of large fish, 153 of them;  
and although there were so many, the net was not torn.

## John 21:12

Jesus _said to them_, “Come and have breakfast.”  
None of the disciples ventured to inquire of Him, “Who are You?” knowing that it was the Lord.

## John 21:13

Jesus _came_ and _took the bread_ and _gave it to them_, and likewise the fish.

## John 21:14

This was now the third time that Jesus revealed Himself to the disciples, after He was raised from the dead.

## John 21:15

Now when they had finished breakfast, Jesus _said to Simon Peter_,  
“Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these?”  
He _said to Him_, “Yes, Lord; You know that I love You.”  
He _said to him_, “Feed My lambs.”

## John 21:16

He _said to him_ again, a second time, “Simon, son of John, do you love Me?”  
He _said to Him_, “Yes, Lord; You know that I love You.”  
He _said to him_, “Shepherd My sheep.”

## John 21:17

He _said to him_ the third time, “Simon, son of John, do you love Me?”  
Peter was hurt because He said to him the third time, “Do you love Me?”  
And he _said to Him_, “Lord, You know all things; You know that I love You.”  
Jesus _said to him_, “Feed My sheep.

## John 21:18

Truly, truly I say to you, when you were younger, you used to put on your belt and walk wherever you wanted;  
but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands and someone else will put your belt on you,  
and bring you where you do not want to go.”

## John 21:19

Now He said this, indicating by what kind of death he would glorify God.  
And when He had said this, He _said to him_, “Follow Me!”

---

## John 21:20

Peter turned around and _saw_ the disciple whom Jesus loved following them,  
the one who also had leaned back on His chest at the supper and said, “Lord, who is the one betraying You?”

## John 21:21

So Peter, upon seeing him, _said to Jesus_, “Lord, and what about this man?”

## John 21:22

Jesus _said to him_,  
“If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow Me!”

## John 21:23

Therefore this account went out among the brothers, that this disciple would not die;  
yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die,  
but only, “If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you?”

---

## John 21:24

This is the disciple who is testifying about these things and wrote these things,  
and we know that his testimony is true.

## John 21:25

But there are also many other things which Jesus did,  
which, if they were written in detail, I expect that even the world itself would not contain the books that would be written.
