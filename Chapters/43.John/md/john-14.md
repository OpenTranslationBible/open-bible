# John Chapter 14

## John 14:1

“Do not let your hearts be troubled; believe in God, believe also in Me.

## John 14:2

In My Father’s house are many rooms; if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you?

## John 14:3

And if I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will take you to Myself,  
so that where I am, there you also will be.

## John 14:4

And you know the way where I am going.”

## John 14:5

Thomas _said to Him_,  
“Lord, we do not know where You are going; how do we know the way?”

## John 14:6

Jesus _said to him_,  
“I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me.

## John 14:7

If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also;  
from now on you know Him, and have seen Him.”

## John 14:8

Philip _said to Him_, “Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us.”

## John 14:9

Jesus _said to him_,  
“Have I been with you for so long a time, and yet you have not come to know Me, Philip?  
The one who has seen Me has seen the Father; how can you say, ‘Show us the Father’?

## John 14:10

Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me?  
The words that I say to you I do not speak on My own,  
but the Father, as He remains in Me, does His works.

## John 14:11

Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me; otherwise believe because of the works themselves.

## John 14:12

Truly, truly I say to you, the one who believes in Me, the works that I do, he will do also;  
and greater works than these he will do, because I am going to the Father.

## John 14:13

And whatever you ask in My name, this I will do, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.

## John 14:14

If you ask Me anything in My name, I will do it.

## John 14:15

“If you love Me, you will keep My commandments.

## John 14:16

I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Helper, so that He may be with you forever;

## John 14:17

the Helper is the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive,  
because it does not see Him or know Him; but you know Him because He remains with you and will be in you.

## John 14:18

I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you.

## John 14:19

After a little while, the world no longer is going to see Me, but you are going to see Me;  
because I live, you also will live.

## John 14:20

On that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you are in Me, and I in you.

## John 14:21

The one who has My commandments and keeps them is the one who loves Me;  
and the one who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will reveal Myself to him.”

---

## John 14:22

Judas (not Iscariot) _said to Him_,  
“Lord, what has happened that You are going to reveal Yourself to us, and not to the world?”

## John 14:23

Jesus answered and said to him,  
“If anyone loves Me, he will follow My word; and My Father will love him,  
and We will come to him and make Our dwelling with him.

## John 14:24

The one who does not love Me does not follow My words;  
and the word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father’s who sent Me.

---

## John 14:25

These things I have spoken to you while remaining with you.

## John 14:26

But the Helper, the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in My name,  
He will teach you all things, and remind you of all that I said to you.

## John 14:27

Peace I leave you, My peace I give you; not as the world gives do I give to you.  
Do not let your hearts be troubled, nor fearful.

## John 14:28

You heard that I said to you, ‘I am going away, and I am coming to you.’  
If you loved Me, you would have rejoiced, because I am going to the Father,  
for the Father is greater than I.

## John 14:29

And now I have told you before it happens, so that when it does happen, you may believe.

## John 14:30

I will not speak much more with you, for the ruler of the world is coming, and he has nothing in regard to Me,

## John 14:31

but so that the world may know that I love the Father,  
I do exactly as the Father commanded Me.

Get up, let’s go from here.
