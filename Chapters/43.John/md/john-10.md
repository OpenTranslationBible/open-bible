# John Chapter 10

## John 10:1

“Truly, truly I say to you, the one who does not enter by the door into the fold of the sheep,  
but climbs up some other way, he is a thief and a robber.

## John 10:2

But the one who enters by the door is a shepherd of the sheep.

## John 10:3

To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep listen to his voice,  
and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.

## John 10:4

When he puts all his own sheep outside, he goes ahead of them,  
and the sheep follow him because they know his voice.

## John 10:5

However, a stranger they simply will not follow,  
but will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers.”

## John 10:6

Jesus told them this figure of speech, but they did not understand what the things which He was saying to them meant.

---

## John 10:7

So Jesus said to them again,  
“Truly, truly I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.

## John 10:8

All those who came before Me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them.

## John 10:9

I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he will be saved,  
and will go in and out and find pasture.

## John 10:10

The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy;  
I came so that they would have life, and have it abundantly.

---

## John 10:11

I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.

## John 10:12

He who is a hired hand, and not a shepherd, who is not the owner of the sheep,  
sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches them and scatters the flock.

## John 10:13

He flees because he is a hired hand and does not care about the sheep.

## John 10:14

I am the good shepherd, and I know My own, and My own know Me,

## John 10:15

just as the Father knows Me and I know the Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep.

## John 10:16

And I have other sheep that are not of this fold; I must bring them also,  
and they will listen to My voice, and they will become one flock, with one shepherd.

## John 10:17

For this reason the Father loves Me, because I lay down My life so that I may take it back.

## John 10:18

No one has taken it away from Me, but I lay it down on My own.  
I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it back.  
This commandment I received from My Father.”

## John 10:19

Dissension occurred again among the Jews because of these words.

## John 10:20

Many of them were saying,  
“He has a demon and is insane. Why do you listen to Him?”

## John 10:21

Others were saying,  
“These are not the words of one who is demon-possessed. A demon cannot open the eyes of those who are blind, can it?”

## John 10:22

At that time the Feast of the Dedication took place in Jerusalem; it was winter,

## John 10:23

and Jesus was walking in the temple area, in the Portico of Solomon.

## John 10:24

The Jews then surrounded Him and began saying to Him,  
“How long will You keep us in suspense? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly.”

## John 10:25

Jesus answered them,  
“I told you, and you do not believe;  
the works that I do in My Father’s name, these testify of Me.

## John 10:26

But you do not believe, because you are not of My sheep.

## John 10:27

My sheep listen to My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me;

## John 10:28

and I give them eternal life, and they will never perish; and no one will snatch them out of My hand.

## John 10:29

My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all;  
and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand.

## John 10:30

I and the Father are one.”

---

## John 10:31

The Jews picked up stones again to stone Him.

## John 10:32

Jesus replied to them,  
“I showed you many good works from the Father; for which of them are you stoning Me?”

## John 10:33

The Jews answered Him,  
“We are not stoning You for a good work, but for blasphemy;  
and because You, being a man, make Yourself out to be God.”

## John 10:34

Jesus answered them,  
“Has it not been written in your Law: ‘I said, you are gods’?

## John 10:35

If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture cannot be nullified),

## John 10:36

are you saying of Him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world,  
‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God’?

## John 10:37

If I do not do the works of My Father, do not believe Me;

## John 10:38

but if I do them, even though you do not believe Me, believe the works,  
so that you may know and understand that the Father is in Me, and I in the Father.”

## John 10:39

Therefore they were seeking again to arrest Him, and He eluded their grasp.

---

## John 10:40

And He went away again beyond the Jordan to the place where John was first baptising, and He stayed there.

## John 10:41

Many came to Him and were saying,  
“John performed no sign, yet everything John said about this man was true.”

## John 10:42

And many believed in Him there.
