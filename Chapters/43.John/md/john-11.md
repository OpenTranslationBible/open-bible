# John Chapter 11

## John 11:1

Now a man was sick, Lazarus from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.

## John 11:2

It was the Mary who anointed the Lord with perfume and wiped His feet with her hair,  
whose brother Lazarus was sick.

## John 11:3

So the sisters sent word to Him, saying,  
“Lord, behold, he whom You love is sick.”

## John 11:4

But when Jesus heard this, He said,  
“This sickness is not meant for death, but is for the glory of God,  
so that the Son of God may be glorified by it.”

---

## John 11:5

Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister, and Lazarus.

## John 11:6

So when He heard that he was sick, He then stayed two days longer in the place where He was.

## John 11:7

Then after this He _said to the disciples_, “Let’s go to Judea again.”

## John 11:8

The disciples _said to Him_,  
“Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone You, and yet You are going there again?”

## John 11:9

Jesus replied,  
“Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks during the day, he does not stumble,  
because he sees the light of this world.

## John 11:10

But if anyone walks during the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.”

---

## John 11:11

This He said, and after this He _said to them_,  
“Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going so that I may awaken him from sleep.”

## John 11:12

The disciples then said to Him,  
“Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will come out of it.”

## John 11:13

Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that He was speaking about actual sleep.

## John 11:14

So Jesus then told them plainly,  
“Lazarus died,

## John 11:15

and I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe; but let’s go to him.”

## John 11:16

Therefore Thomas, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples,  
“Let’s also go, so that we may die with Him!”

---

## John 11:17

So when Jesus came, He found that he had already been in the tomb four days.

## John 11:18

Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia away;

## John 11:19

and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to console them about their brother.

## John 11:20

So then Martha, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went to meet Him; but Mary stayed in the house.

## John 11:21

Martha then _said to Jesus_,  
“Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.

## John 11:22

Even now I know that whatever You ask of God, God will give You.”

## John 11:23

Jesus _said to her_,  
“Your brother will rise from the dead.”

## John 11:24

Martha _said to Him_,  
“I know that he will rise in the resurrection on the last day.”

## John 11:25

Jesus said to her,  
“I am the resurrection and the life; the one who believes in Me will live, even if he dies,

## John 11:26

and everyone who lives and believes in Me will never die. Do you believe this?”

## John 11:27

She _said to Him_,  
“Yes, Lord; I have come to believe that You are the Christ, the Son of God, and He who comes into the world.”

---

## John 11:28

When she had said this, she left and called Mary her sister, saying secretly,  
“The Teacher is here and is calling for you.”

## John 11:29

And when she heard this, she got up quickly and came to Him.

## John 11:30

Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still at the place where Martha met Him.

## John 11:31

Then the Jews who were with her in the house and were consoling her,  
when they saw that Mary had gotten up quickly and left,  
they followed her, thinking that she was going to the tomb to weep there.

## John 11:32

So when Mary came to the place where Jesus was, she saw Him and fell at His feet, saying to Him,  
“Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.”

---

## John 11:33

Therefore, when Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her also weeping,  
He was deeply moved in spirit and was troubled,

## John 11:34

and He said, “Where have you laid him?”  
They _said to Him_, “Lord, come and see.”

## John 11:35

Jesus wept.

## John 11:36

So the Jews were saying,  
“See how He loved him!”

## John 11:37

But some of them said,  
“Could this man, who opened the eyes of the man who was blind, not have also kept this man from dying?”

---

## John 11:38

So Jesus, again being deeply moved within, came to the tomb.  
Now it was a cave, and a stone was lying against it.

## John 11:39

Jesus _said_, “Remove the stone.”  
Martha, the sister of the deceased, _said to Him_,  
“Lord, by this time there will be a stench, for he has been dead four days.”

## John 11:40

Jesus _said to her_,  
“Did I not say to you that if you believe, you will see the glory of God?”

## John 11:41

So they removed the stone.  
And Jesus raised His eyes and said,  
“Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.

## John 11:42

But I knew that You always hear Me;  
nevertheless, because of the people standing around I said it, so that they may believe that You sent Me.”

## John 11:43

And when He had said these things, He cried out with a loud voice,  
“Lazarus, come out!”

## John 11:44

The man who had died came out, bound hand and foot with wrappings, and his face was wrapped with a cloth.  
Jesus _said to them_, “Unbind him, and let him go.”

---

## John 11:45

Therefore many of the Jews who came to Mary, and saw what He had done, believed in Him.

## John 11:46

But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them the things which Jesus had done.

---

## John 11:47

Therefore the chief priests and the Pharisees convened a council meeting, and they were saying,  
“What are we doing in regard to the fact that this man is performing many signs?

## John 11:48

If we let Him go on like this, all the people will believe in Him,  
and the Romans will come and take over both our place and our nation.”

## John 11:49

But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them,  
“You know nothing at all,

## John 11:50

nor are you taking into account that it is in your best interest that one man die for the people,  
and that the whole nation not perish instead.”

## John 11:51

Now he did not say this on his own, but as he was high priest that year,  
he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation;

## John 11:52

and not for the nation only, but also so that He might gather together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.

## John 11:53

So from that day on they planned together to kill Him.

---

## John 11:54

Therefore Jesus no longer continued to walk publicly among the Jews,  
but went away from there to the region near the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim;  
and there He stayed with the disciples.

## John 11:55

Now the Passover of the Jews was near,  
and many people went up to Jerusalem from the country before the Passover, to purify themselves.

## John 11:56

So they were looking for Jesus, and were saying to one another as they stood in the temple area,  
“What do you think; that He will not come to the feast at all?”

## John 11:57

Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where He was,  
he was to report it, so that they might arrest Him.
