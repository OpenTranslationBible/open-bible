# Esther Chapter 2

## Esther 2:1

After these things, when the anger of King Ahasuerus had subsided,  
he remembered Vashti and what she had done, and what had been decided regarding her.

## Esther 2:2

Then the king’s attendants who served him said,  
“Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king,

## Esther 2:3

and may the king appoint overseers in all the provinces of his kingdom,  
and have them bring every beautiful young virgin to the citadel of Susa,  
to the harem, into the custody of Hegai, the king’s eunuch, who is in charge of the women;  
and let their cosmetics be given to them.

## Esther 2:4

Then let the young woman who pleases the king be queen in place of Vashti.”  
And the matter pleased the king, and he did accordingly.

## Esther 2:5

There was a Jew at the citadel in Susa whose name was Mordecai,  
the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjaminite,

## Esther 2:6

who had been taken into exile from Jerusalem with the captives  
who had been exiled with Jeconiah king of Judah,  
whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had exiled.

## Esther 2:7

He was the guardian of Hadassah, that is Esther, his uncle’s daughter,  
for she had no father or mother.  
Now the young woman was beautiful in figure and appearance,  
and when her father and mother died, Mordecai took her as his own daughter.

## Esther 2:8

So it came about, when the command and decree of the king were heard,  
and many young women were gathered to the citadel of Susa into the custody of Hegai,  
that Esther was taken to the king’s palace into the custody of Hegai, who was in charge of the women.

## Esther 2:9

Now the young woman pleased him and found favour with him.  
So he quickly provided her with cosmetics and food,  
gave her seven choice attendants from the king’s palace,  
and transferred her and her attendants to the best place in the harem.

## Esther 2:10

Esther did not reveal her people or her lineage,  
because Mordecai had instructed her not to reveal them.

## Esther 2:11

And every day Mordecai walked in front of the courtyard of the harem  
to learn how Esther was doing and what was happening to her.

---

## Esther 2:12

Now when the turn came for each young woman to go in to King Ahasuerus,  
after the end of her twelve months under the regulations for the women—  
for the days of their beautification were completed as follows:  
six months with oil of myrrh and six months with spices and the cosmetics for women—

## Esther 2:13

then the young woman would go in to the king in this way:  
anything that she desired was given her to take with her from the harem to the king’s palace.

## Esther 2:14

In the evening she would go in,  
and in the morning she would return to the second harem,  
to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch who was in charge of the concubines.  
She would not return to the king unless the king delighted in her and she was summoned by name.

## Esther 2:15

Now when the turn came for Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai,  
who had taken her as his daughter, to go in to the king,  
she did not request anything except what Hegai, the king’s eunuch in charge of the women, advised.  
And Esther found favour in the eyes of all who saw her.

## Esther 2:16

So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus, to his royal palace in the tenth month (that is, the month Tebeth)  
in the seventh year of his reign.

## Esther 2:17

And the king loved Esther more than all the other women,  
and she found favour and kindness with him more than all the virgins,  
so that he set the royal crown on her head and made her queen in place of Vashti.

## Esther 2:18

Then the king held a great banquet, Esther’s banquet, for all his officials and his servants.  
He also made a holiday for the provinces and gave gifts in proportion to the king’s bounty.

---

## Esther 2:19

Now when the virgins were gathered together for the second time,  
then Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate.

## Esther 2:20

Esther still had not revealed her lineage or her people,  
just as Mordecai had instructed her;  
for Esther followed Mordecai’s instructions as she had done under his care.

---

## Esther 2:21

In those days, while Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate,  
Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs from the doorkeepers, became angry  
and sought to lay hands on King Ahasuerus.

## Esther 2:22

But the plot became known to Mordecai, and he informed Queen Esther,  
and Esther told the king in Mordecai’s name.

## Esther 2:23

Then when the matter was investigated and found to be so,  
they were both hanged on a wooden gallows;  
and it was written in the Book of the Chronicles in the presence of the king.
