# Esther Chapter 5

## Esther 5:1

Now it happened on the third day that Esther put on her royal robes  
and stood in the inner courtyard of the king’s palace,  
in front of the king’s rooms,  
and the king was sitting on his royal throne in the throne room,  
opposite the entrance to the palace.

## Esther 5:2

When the king saw Esther the queen standing in the courtyard,  
she obtained favour in his sight;  
and the king extended to Esther the golden sceptre which was in his hand.  
So Esther approached and touched the top of the sceptre.

## Esther 5:3

Then the king said to her,  
“What is troubling you, Queen Esther?  
And what is your request?  
Even to half of the kingdom it shall be given to you.”

---

## Esther 5:4

Esther said,  
“If it pleases the king, may the king and Haman come this day to the banquet  
that I have prepared for him.”

## Esther 5:5

Then the king said,

---

“Bring Haman quickly so that we may do as Esther desires.”  
So the king and Haman came to the banquet which Esther had prepared.

## Esther 5:6

As they drank their wine at the banquet, the king said to Esther,  
“What is your request? For it shall be granted to you.  
And what is your wish? Even to half of the kingdom it shall be done.”

## Esther 5:7

So Esther replied and said,

## Esther 5:8

“If I have found favour in the sight of the king,  
and if it pleases the king to grant my request and to do what I wish,  
may the king and Haman come to the banquet which I will prepare for them,  
and tomorrow I will do as the king says.”

## Esther 5:9

Then Haman went out that day joyful and pleased of heart;  
but when Haman saw Mordecai at the king’s gate,  
and that he did not stand up or tremble before him,  
Haman was filled with anger toward Mordecai.

## Esther 5:10

But Haman controlled himself and went to his house.

---

And he sent for his friends and his wife Zeresh.

## Esther 5:11

Then Haman told them about the glory of his riches,  
and the number of his sons,  
and every occasion on which the king had honoured him  
and how he had promoted him above the officials and servants of the king.

## Esther 5:12

Haman also said,  
“Even Esther the queen let no one except me come with the king to the banquet which she had prepared;  
and tomorrow also I am invited by her with the king.

## Esther 5:13

Yet all of this does not satisfy me  
every time I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.”

---

## Esther 5:14

Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said to him,  
“Have a wooden gallows fifty cubits high made,  
and in the morning ask the king to have Mordecai hanged on it;  
then go joyfully with the king to the banquet.”  
And the advice pleased Haman,  
so he had the gallows made.
