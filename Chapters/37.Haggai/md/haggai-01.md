# Haggai Chapter 1

## Haggai 1:1

In the second year of King Darius, on the first day of the sixth month, the word of the Lord came by the prophet Haggai to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, saying,

## Haggai 1:2

> “This is what the Lord of armies says:  
> ‘This people says, “The time has not come,  
> The time for the house of the Lord to be rebuilt.”’”

## Haggai 1:3

Then the word of the Lord came by Haggai the prophet, saying,

## Haggai 1:4

> “Is it time for you yourselves to live in your panelled houses,  
> While this house remains desolate?”

## Haggai 1:5

> Now then, this is what the Lord of armies says:  
> “Consider your ways!

## Haggai 1:6

> You have sown much, only to harvest little;  
> You eat, but there is not enough to be satisfied;  
> You drink, but there is not enough to become drunk;  
> You put on clothing, but no one is warm enough;  
> And the one who earns, earns wages to put into a money bag full of holes.”

## Haggai 1:7

> This is what the Lord of armies says:  
> “Consider your ways!

## Haggai 1:8

> Go up to the mountains, bring wood, and rebuild the temple,  
> That I may be pleased with it and be honoured,” says the Lord.

## Haggai 1:9

> “You start an ambitious project, but behold, it comes to little;  
> When you bring it home, I blow it away.  
> Why?” declares the Lord of armies.  
> “Because of My house which remains desolate,  
> While each of you runs to his own house.

## Haggai 1:10

> Therefore, because of you the sky has withheld its dew,  
> And the earth has withheld its produce.

## Haggai 1:11

> And I called for a drought on the land, on the mountains,  
> On the grain, on the new wine, on the oil,  
> On what the ground produces, on mankind, on cattle,  
> And on all the products of the labour of your hands.”

## Haggai 1:12

Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the Lord their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, just as the Lord their God had sent him. And the people showed reverence for the Lord.

Then Haggai, the messenger of the Lord, spoke by the commission of the Lord to the people, saying,

> “‘I am with you,’ declares the Lord.”
