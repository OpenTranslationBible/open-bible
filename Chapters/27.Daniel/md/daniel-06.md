# Daniel Chapter 6

## Daniel 6:1

It pleased Darius to appoint 120 satraps over the kingdom, to be in charge of the whole kingdom,

## Daniel 6:2

And over them, three commissioners (of whom Daniel was one), so that the satraps would be accountable to them, and that the king would not suffer loss.

## Daniel 6:3

Then this Daniel began distinguishing himself among the commissioners and satraps because he possessed an extraordinary spirit, and the king intended to appoint him over the entire kingdom.

## Daniel 6:4

Then the commissioners and satraps began trying to find a ground of accusation against Daniel regarding government affairs; but they could find no ground of accusation or evidence of corruption, because he was trustworthy, and no negligence or corruption was to be found in him.

## Daniel 6:5

Then these men said, “We will not find any ground of accusation against this Daniel unless we find it against him regarding the law of his God.”

## Daniel 6:6

Then these commissioners and satraps came by agreement to the king and spoke to him as follows: “King Darius, live forever!

## Daniel 6:7

All the commissioners of the kingdom, the prefects and the satraps, the counselors and the governors have consulted together that the king should establish a statute and enforce an injunction that anyone who makes a petition to any god or person besides you, O king, for thirty days, shall be thrown into the lions’ den.

## Daniel 6:8

Now, O king, establish the injunction and sign the document, so that it will not be changed, in accordance with the law of the Medes and Persians, which may not be revoked.”

## Daniel 6:9

Thereupon, King Darius signed the document, that is, the injunction.

## Daniel 6:10

Now when Daniel learned that the document was signed, he entered his house (now in his roof chamber he had windows open toward Jerusalem); and he continued kneeling on his knees three times a day, praying and offering praise before his God, just as he had been doing previously.

## Daniel 6:11

Then these men came by agreement and found Daniel offering a prayer and imploring favor before his God.

## Daniel 6:12

Then they approached and spoke before the king about the king’s injunction: “Did you not sign an injunction that any person who makes a petition to any god or person besides you, O king, for thirty days, is to be thrown into the lions’ den?” The king replied, “The statement is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which may not be revoked.”

## Daniel 6:13

Then they responded and spoke before the king, “Daniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, O king, or to the injunction which you signed, but keeps offering his prayer three times a day.”

## Daniel 6:14

Then, as soon as the king heard this statement, he was deeply distressed, and set his mind on rescuing Daniel; and until sunset he kept exerting himself to save him.

## Daniel 6:15

Then these men came by agreement to the king and said to the king, “Recognize, O king, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no injunction or statute which the king establishes may be changed.”

## Daniel 6:16

Then the king gave orders, and Daniel was brought in and thrown into the lions’ den. The king said to Daniel, “Your God whom you continually serve will Himself rescue you.”

## Daniel 6:17

And a stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his signet ring and with the signet rings of his nobles, so that nothing would be changed regarding Daniel.

## Daniel 6:18

Then the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting, and no entertainment was brought before him; and his sleep fled from him.

## Daniel 6:19

Then the king got up at dawn, at the break of day, and went in a hurry to the lions’ den.

## Daniel 6:20

When he had come near the den to Daniel, he cried out with a troubled voice. The king began speaking and said to Daniel, “Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you continually serve, been able to rescue you from the lions?”

## Daniel 6:21

Then Daniel spoke to the king, “O king, live forever!

## Daniel 6:22

My God sent His angel and shut the lions’ mouths, and they have not harmed me, since I was found innocent before Him; and also toward you, O king, I have committed no crime.”

## Daniel 6:23

Then the king was very glad and gave orders for Daniel to be brought up out of the den. So Daniel was brought up out of the den, and no injury whatever was found on him, because he had trusted in his God.

## Daniel 6:24

The king then gave orders, and they brought those men who had maliciously accused Daniel, and they threw them, their children, and their wives into the lions’ den; and they had not reached the bottom of the den before the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones.

## Daniel 6:25

Then Darius the king wrote to all the peoples, nations, and populations of all languages who were living in all the land: “May your peace be great!

## Daniel 6:26

I issue a decree that in all the realm of my kingdom people are to tremble and fear before the God of Daniel;

> For He is the living God and enduring forever,  
> And His kingdom is one which will not be destroyed,  
> And His dominion will be forever.

## Daniel 6:27

> He rescues, saves, and performs signs and miracles  
> In heaven and on earth,  
> He who has also rescued Daniel from the power of the lions.”

## Daniel 6:28

So this Daniel enjoyed success in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
