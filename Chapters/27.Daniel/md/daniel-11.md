# Daniel Chapter 11

## Daniel 11:1

In the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood to strengthen and to be a protection for him.

## Daniel 11:2

Now I will tell you the truth. Behold, three more kings are going to arise in Persia. Then a fourth will gain far more riches than all of them; and as soon as he becomes strong through his riches, he will stir up the whole empire against the kingdom of Greece.

## Daniel 11:3

And a mighty king will arise, and he will rule with great authority and do as he pleases.

## Daniel 11:4

But as soon as he has arisen, his kingdom will be broken up and parceled out toward the four points of the compass, though not to his own descendants, nor according to his authority which he wielded, because his kingdom will be uprooted and given to others besides them.

## Daniel 11:5

Then the king of the South will grow strong, together with one of his princes who will gain ascendancy over him and rule; his domain will be a great dominion indeed.

## Daniel 11:6

After some years they will form an alliance, and the daughter of the king of the South will come to the king of the North to make an agreement. But she will not retain her position of power, nor will he remain with his power; but she will be given up, along with her supporters and her father and the one who supported her in those times.

## Daniel 11:7

But one of the descendants of her line will arise in his place, and he will come against their army and enter the fortress of the king of the North, and he will deal with them and prevail.

## Daniel 11:8

And he will take their gods into captivity to Egypt, along with their cast metal images and their precious vessels of silver and gold; and for some years he will stay away from the king of the North.

## Daniel 11:9

Then the latter will enter the realm of the king of the South, but will return to his own land.

## Daniel 11:10

And his sons will mobilize and assemble a multitude of great forces; and one of them will keep on coming and overflow and pass through, so that he may carry on the war up to his fortress.

## Daniel 11:11

And the king of the South will be enraged and go out and fight with the king of the North. Then the latter will raise a great multitude, but that multitude will be handed over to the former.

## Daniel 11:12

When the multitude is carried away, his heart will be haughty, and he will cause tens of thousands to fall; yet he will not prevail.

## Daniel 11:13

For the king of the North will again raise a greater multitude than the former, and after an interval of some years he will press on with a great army and abundant supplies.

## Daniel 11:14

Now in those times many will rise up against the king of the South; the violent ones among your people will also raise themselves up to fulfill the vision, but they will fall down.

## Daniel 11:15

Then the king of the North will come, pile up a siege ramp, and capture a well-fortified city; and the forces of the South will not stand their ground, not even their choicest troops, for there will be no strength to make a stand.

## Daniel 11:16

But he who comes against him will do as he pleases, and no one will be able to withstand him; he will also stay for a time in the Beautiful Land, with destruction in his hand.

## Daniel 11:17

And he will set his face to come with the power of his entire kingdom, bringing with him a proposal of peace which he will put into effect; he will also give him the daughter of women to ruin it. But she will not take a stand for him or be on his side.

## Daniel 11:18

Then he will turn his face to the coastlands and capture many. But a commander will put a stop to his taunting against him; moreover, he will repay him for his taunt.

## Daniel 11:19

So he will turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land, but he will stumble and fall and not be found.

## Daniel 11:20

Then in his place one will arise who will allow an oppressor to pass through the Jewel of his kingdom; yet within a few days he will be broken, though not in anger nor in battle.

## Daniel 11:21

And in his place a despicable person will arise, on whom the majesty of kingship has not been conferred, but he will come in a time of tranquility and seize the kingdom by intrigue.

## Daniel 11:22

Overflowing forces will be flooded away before him and shattered, and also the prince of the covenant.

## Daniel 11:23

And after an alliance is made with him he will practice deception, and he will go up and gain power with a small force of people.

## Daniel 11:24

In a time of tranquility he will enter the richest parts of the realm, and he will accomplish what his fathers and forefathers never did: he will distribute plunder, spoils, and possessions among them, and devise schemes against strongholds, but only for a time.

## Daniel 11:25

And he will stir up his strength and courage against the king of the South with a large army; so the king of the South will prepare for war with an even larger and very mighty army, but he will not stand, for schemes will be devised against him.

## Daniel 11:26

And those who eat his choice food will destroy him, and his army will overflow, but many will fall down slain.

## Daniel 11:27

As for both kings, their hearts will be intent on evil, and they will speak lies to each other at the same table; but it will not succeed, for the end is still to come at the appointed time.

## Daniel 11:28

Then he will return to his land with much plunder; but his heart will be set against the holy covenant, and he will take action and then return to his own land.

## Daniel 11:29

At the appointed time he will return and come into the South, but this last time it will not turn out the way it did before.

## Daniel 11:30

For ships of Kittim will come against him; therefore he will be disheartened and will return and become enraged at the holy covenant and take action; so he will come back and show regard for those who abandon the holy covenant.

## Daniel 11:31

Forces from him will arise, desecrate the sanctuary fortress, do away with the regular sacrifice, and they will set up the abomination of desolation.

## Daniel 11:32

And by smooth words he will turn to godlessness those who act wickedly toward the covenant, but the people who know their God will be strong and take action.

## Daniel 11:33

And those who have insight among the people will give understanding to the many; yet they will fall by sword and by flame, by captivity and by plunder for many days.

## Daniel 11:34

Now when they fall they will be granted a little help, and many will join them in hypocrisy.

## Daniel 11:35

And some of those who have insight will fall, to refine, purge, and make them pure until the end time; because it is still to come at the appointed time.

## Daniel 11:36

Then the king will do as he pleases, and he will exalt himself and boast against every god, and will speak dreadful things against the God of gods; and he will be successful until the indignation is finished, because that which is determined will be done.

## Daniel 11:37

And he will show no regard for the gods of his fathers or for the desire of women, nor will he show regard for any other god; for he will boast against them all.

## Daniel 11:38

But instead he will honor a god of fortresses, a god whom his fathers did not know; he will honor him with gold, silver, precious stones, and treasures.

## Daniel 11:39

And he will take action against the strongest fortresses with the help of a foreign god; he will give great honor to those who acknowledge him and make them rulers over many, and will parcel out land for a price.

## Daniel 11:40

At the end time the king of the South will wage war with him, and the king of the North will storm against him with chariots, horsemen, and many ships; and he will enter countries, overflow them, and pass through.

## Daniel 11:41

He will also enter the Beautiful Land, and many countries will fall; but these will be rescued from his hand: Edom, Moab, and the foremost of the sons of Ammon.

## Daniel 11:42

Then he will reach out with his hand against other countries, and the land of Egypt will not escape.

## Daniel 11:43

But he will gain control over the hidden treasures of gold and silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt; and Libyans and Ethiopians will follow at his heels.

## Daniel 11:44

But rumors from the east and from the north will terrify him, and he will go out with great wrath to eliminate and annihilate many.

## Daniel 11:45

And he will pitch the tents of his royal pavilion between the seas and the beautiful Holy Mountain; yet he will come to his end, and no one will help him.
