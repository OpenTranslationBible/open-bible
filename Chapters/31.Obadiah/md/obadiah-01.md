# Obadiah Chapter 1

## Obadiah 1:1

The vision of Obadiah.

This is what the Lord God says concerning Edom—

> We have heard a report from the Lord,  
> And an envoy has been sent among the nations saying,  
> “Arise, and let us go against her for battle”—

## Obadiah 1:2

> “Behold, I will make you small among the nations;  
> You are greatly despised.

## Obadiah 1:3

> The arrogance of your heart has deceived you,  
> You who live in the clefts of the rock,  
> In the loftiness of your dwelling place,  
> Who say in your heart,  
> ‘Who will bring me down to earth?’

## Obadiah 1:4

> Though you make your nest as high as an eagle,  
> Though you set it among the stars,  
> From there I will bring you down,” declares the Lord.

## Obadiah 1:5

> “If thieves came to you,  
> If robbers by night—  
> Oh how you will be ruined!—  
> Would they not steal only until they had enough?  
> If grape-gatherers came to you,  
> Would they not leave some gleanings?

## Obadiah 1:6

> Oh how Esau will be searched,  
> And his hidden treasures ransacked!

## Obadiah 1:7

> All the people allied with you  
> Will send you to the border,  
> And the people at peace with you  
> Will deceive you and overpower you.  
> Those who eat your bread  
> Will set an ambush for you.  
> (There is no understanding in him.)

## Obadiah 1:8

> Will I not on that day,” declares the Lord,  
> “Eliminate wise men from Edom,  
> And understanding from the mountain of Esau?

## Obadiah 1:9

> Then your warriors will be terrified, Teman,  
> So that everyone may be eliminated  
> From the mountain of Esau by murder.

## Obadiah 1:10

> Because of violence to your brother Jacob,  
> Shame will cover you,  
> And you will be eliminated forever.

## Obadiah 1:11

> On the day that you stood aloof,  
> On the day that strangers took his wealth,  
> And foreigners entered his gate  
> And cast lots for Jerusalem—  
> You too were as one of them.

## Obadiah 1:12

> Do not gloat over your brother’s day,  
> The day of his misfortune.  
> And do not rejoice over the sons of Judah  
> On the day of their destruction;  
> Yes, do not boast  
> On the day of their distress.

## Obadiah 1:13

> Do not enter the gate of My people  
> On the day of their disaster.  
> Yes, you, do not gloat over their misery  
> On the day of their disaster.  
> And do not loot their wealth  
> On the day of their disaster.

## Obadiah 1:14

> Do not stand at the crossroads  
> To eliminate their survivors;  
> And do not hand over their refugees  
> On the day of their distress.

## Obadiah 1:15

> For the day of the Lord is near  
> For all the nations!  
> Just as you have done, it will be done to you.  
> Your dealings will return on your own head.

## Obadiah 1:16

> For just as you drank on My holy mountain,  
> All the nations will drink continually.  
> They will drink and swallow,  
> And become as if they had never existed.

## Obadiah 1:17

> But on Mount Zion there will be those who escape,  
> And it will be holy.  
> And the house of Jacob will take possession  
> Of their possessions.

## Obadiah 1:18

> Then the house of Jacob will be a fire,  
> And the house of Joseph a flame;  
> But the house of Esau will be like stubble.  
> And they will set them on fire and consume them,  
> So that there will be no survivor  
> Of the house of Esau,”  
> For the Lord has spoken.

## Obadiah 1:19

> Then those of the Negev will possess the mountain of Esau,  
> And those of the Shephelah the Philistine Plain;  
> They will also possess the territory of Ephraim and the territory of Samaria,  
> And Benjamin will possess Gilead.

## Obadiah 1:20

> And the exiles of this army of the sons of Israel,  
> Who are among the Canaanites as far as Zarephath,  
> And the exiles of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad  
> Will possess the cities of the Negev.

## Obadiah 1:21

> The deliverers will ascend Mount Zion  
> To judge the mountain of Esau,  
> And the kingdom will be the Lord’s.
