# Lamentations Chapter 4

## Lamentations 4:1

How dark the gold has become,  
How the pure gold has changed!  
The sacred stones are poured out  
At the corner of every street.

## Lamentations 4:2

The precious sons of Zion,  
Weighed against fine gold,  
How they are regarded as earthenware jars,  
The work of a potter's hands!

## Lamentations 4:3

Even jackals offer the breast,  
They nurse their young;  
But the daughter of my people has become cruel,  
Like ostriches in the wilderness.

## Lamentations 4:4

The tongue of the nursing infant clings  
To the roof of its mouth from thirst;  
Little children ask for bread,  
But no one breaks it for them.

## Lamentations 4:5

Those who ate delicacies  
Are desolate in the streets;  
Those who were raised in purple  
Embrace ash heaps.

## Lamentations 4:6

For the wrongdoing of the daughter of my people  
Is greater than the sin of Sodom,  
Which was overthrown as in a moment,  
And no hands were turned toward her.

## Lamentations 4:7

Her consecrated ones were purer than snow,  
They were whiter than milk;  
They were more ruddy in body than coral,  
Their form was like lapis lazuli.

## Lamentations 4:8

Their appearance is darker than soot,  
They are not recognised in the streets;  
Their skin is shrivelled on their bones,  
It is dry, it has become like wood.

## Lamentations 4:9

Those slain by the sword  
Are better off than those who die of hunger;  
For they waste away,  
Stricken for lack of the produce of the field.

## Lamentations 4:10

The hands of compassionate women  
Boiled their own children;  
They became food for them  
Because of the destruction of the daughter of my people.

## Lamentations 4:11

The Lord has expended His wrath,  
He has poured out His fierce anger;  
And He has kindled a fire in Zion,  
Which has consumed its foundations.

## Lamentations 4:12

The kings of the earth did not believe,  
Nor did any of the inhabitants of the world,  
That the adversary and the enemy  
Would enter the gates of Jerusalem.

## Lamentations 4:13

Because of the sins of her prophets  
And the wrongdoings of her priests,  
Who have shed in her midst  
The blood of the righteous,

## Lamentations 4:14

They wandered, blind, in the streets;  
They were defiled with blood  
So that no one could touch their garments.

## Lamentations 4:15

"Keep away! Unclean!" they cried of themselves.  
"Keep away, keep away, do not touch!"  
For they fled and wandered;  
People said among the nations,  
"They shall not continue to reside with us."

## Lamentations 4:16

The presence of the Lord has scattered them,  
He will not continue to look at them;  
They did not honour the priests,  
They did not favour the elders.

## Lamentations 4:17

Yet our eyes failed,  
Looking for help in vain;  
In our watching we have watched  
For a nation that could not save.

## Lamentations 4:18

They hunted our steps  
So that we could not walk in our streets;  
Our end drew near,  
Our days were finished,  
For our end had come.

## Lamentations 4:19

Our pursuers were swifter  
Than the eagles of the sky;  
They chased us on the mountains,  
They waited in ambush for us in the wilderness.

## Lamentations 4:20

The breath of our nostrils,  
The Lordâ€™s anointed,  
Was captured in their pits,  
Of whom we had said,  
"Under his shadow  
We shall live among the nations."

## Lamentations 4:21

Rejoice and be joyful, daughter of Edom,  
Who lives in the land of Uz;  
But the cup will pass to you as well,  
You will become drunk and expose yourself.

## Lamentations 4:22

The punishment of your wrongdoing has been completed,  
Daughter of Zion;  
He will no longer exile you.  
But He will punish your wrongdoing,  
Daughter of Edom;  
He will expose your sins.
