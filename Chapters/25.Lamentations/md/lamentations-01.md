# Lamentations Chapter 1

## Lamentations 1:1

How lonely sits the city that was full of people!  
She has become like a widow,  
She who was great among the nations!  
She who was a princess among the provinces  
Has become a forced labourer!

## Lamentations 1:2

She weeps bitterly in the night,  
And her tears are on her cheeks;  
She has none to comfort her  
Among all her lovers.  
All her friends have dealt treacherously with her;  
They have become her enemies.

## Lamentations 1:3

Judah has gone into exile under affliction  
And under great servitude;  
She dwells among the nations,  
But she has found no rest.  
All who pursue her have overtaken her  
In the midst of distress.

## Lamentations 1:4

The roads of Zion are in mourning  
Because no one comes to the appointed festivals.  
All her gates are desolate;  
Her priests are groaning,  
Her virgins are afflicted,  
And she herself suffers bitterly.

## Lamentations 1:5

Her adversaries have become her masters,  
Her enemies prosper;  
For the Lord has caused her grief  
Because of the multitude of her wrongdoings.  
Her little ones have gone away  
As captives before the adversary.

## Lamentations 1:6

All her majesty has departed  
From the daughter of Zion.  
Her leaders have become like deer  
That have found no pasture,  
And they have fled without strength  
Before the pursuer.

## Lamentations 1:7

In the days of her affliction and homelessness  
Jerusalem remembers all her precious things  
That were hers from the days of old,  
When her people fell into the hand of the enemy,  
And no one helped her.  
The adversaries saw her,  
They mocked at her ruin.

## Lamentations 1:8

Jerusalem sinned greatly,  
Therefore she has become an object of ridicule.  
All who honoured her despise her  
Because they have seen her nakedness;  
She herself also groans  
And turns away.

## Lamentations 1:9

Her uncleanness is in her skirts;  
She did not consider her future.  
So she has fallen astonishingly;  
She has no comforter.  
“See, Lord, my affliction,  
For the enemy has honoured himself!”

## Lamentations 1:10

The adversary has spread out his hand  
Over all her precious things,  
For she has seen the nations  
Enter her sanctuary,  
The ones whom You commanded  
That they were not to enter into Your assembly.

## Lamentations 1:11

All her people groan  
Seeking bread;  
They have given their precious things for food  
To restore their lives.  
“See, Lord, and look,  
For I am despised!”

## Lamentations 1:12

“Is it nothing to all you who pass this way?  
Look and see if there is any pain like my pain,  
Which was dealt to me,  
Which the Lord inflicted on the day of His fierce anger.

## Lamentations 1:13

From on high He sent fire into my bones,  
And it prevailed over them.  
He has spread a net for my feet;  
He has turned me back.  
He has made me desolate,  
Faint all day long.

## Lamentations 1:14

The yoke of my wrongdoings is bound;  
By His hand they are knit together.  
They have come upon my neck;  
He has made my strength fail.  
The Lord has handed me over  
To those against whom I am not able to stand.

## Lamentations 1:15

The Lord has rejected  
All my strong men in my midst;  
He has summoned an appointed time against me  
To crush my young men.  
The Lord has trampled  
The virgin daughter of Judah  
Like a wine press.

## Lamentations 1:16

For these things I weep;  
My eyes run down with water;  
Because far from me is a comforter,  
One to restore my soul.  
My children are desolate  
Because the enemy has prevailed.”

## Lamentations 1:17

Zion stretches out her hands;  
There is no one to comfort her.  
The Lord has commanded regarding Jacob  
That those around him should be his adversaries;  
Jerusalem has become a filthy thing among them.

## Lamentations 1:18

“The Lord is righteous,  
For I have rebelled against His command;  
Hear now, all peoples,  
And see my pain:  
My virgins and my young men  
Have gone into captivity.

## Lamentations 1:19

I called to my lovers, but they deceived me;  
My priests and my elders perished in the city  
While they sought food for themselves  
To restore their lives.

## Lamentations 1:20

See, Lord, for I am in distress;  
My spirit is greatly troubled;  
My heart is overturned within me,  
Because I have been very rebellious.  
In the street the sword bereaves;  
In the house it is like death.

## Lamentations 1:21

They have heard that I groan;  
There is no one to comfort me.  
All my enemies have heard of my disaster;  
They rejoice that You have done it.  
Oh, that You would bring the day which You have proclaimed,  
So that they will become like me!

## Lamentations 1:22

Let all their wickedness come before You,  
And deal with them as You have dealt with me  
For all my wrongdoings;  
For my groans are many,  
And my heart is faint.”
