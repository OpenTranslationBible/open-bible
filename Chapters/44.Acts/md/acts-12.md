# Acts Chapter 12

## Acts 12:1

Now about that time Herod the king laid hands on some who belonged to the church, to do them harm.

## Acts 12:2

And he had James the brother of John executed with a sword.

## Acts 12:3

When he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter as well.  
Now it was during the days of Unleavened Bread.

## Acts 12:4

When he had arrested him, he put him in prison,  
turning him over to four squads of soldiers to guard him,  
intending only after the Passover to bring him before the people.

## Acts 12:5

So Peter was kept in the prison, but prayer for him was being made fervently by the church to God.

## Acts 12:6

On the very night when Herod was about to bring him forward,  
Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains,  
and guards in front of the door were watching over the prison.

## Acts 12:7

And behold, an angel of the Lord suddenly stood near, and a light shone in the cell;  
and he struck Peter’s side and woke him, saying, “Get up quickly.” And his chains fell off his hands.

## Acts 12:8

And the angel said to him, “Put on your belt and strap on your sandals.”  
And he did so.  
And he _said to him_, “Wrap your cloak around you and follow me.”

## Acts 12:9

And he went out and continued to follow,  
and yet he did not know that what was being done by the angel was real,  
but thought he was seeing a vision.

## Acts 12:10

Now when they had passed the first and second guard,  
they came to the iron gate that leads into the city, which opened by itself;  
and they went out and went along one street, and immediately the angel departed from him.

## Acts 12:11

When Peter came to himself, he said,  
“Now I know for sure that the Lord has sent His angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod  
and from all that the Jewish people were expecting.”

## Acts 12:12

And when he realised this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John, who was also called Mark,  
where many were gathered together and were praying.

## Acts 12:13

When he knocked at the door of the gate, a slave woman named Rhoda came to answer.

## Acts 12:14

When she recognised Peter’s voice, because of her joy she did not open the gate,  
but ran in and announced that Peter was standing in front of the gate.

## Acts 12:15

They said to her, “You are out of your mind!” But she kept insisting that it was so.  
They said, “It is his angel.”

## Acts 12:16

But Peter continued knocking;  
and when they opened the door, they saw him and were amazed.

## Acts 12:17

But motioning to them with his hand to be silent,  
he described to them how the Lord had led him out of the prison.  
And he said, “Report these things to James and the brothers.”  
Then he left and went to another place.

## Acts 12:18

Now when day came, there was no small disturbance among the soldiers  
as to what could have become of Peter.

## Acts 12:19

When Herod had searched for him and had not found him,  
he examined the guards and ordered that they be led away to execution.  
Then he went down from Judea to Caesarea, and stayed there.

---

## Acts 12:20

Now he was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon;  
and with one mind they came to him, and having won over Blastus, the king’s chamberlain,  
they were asking for peace, because their country was supported with food from the king’s country.

## Acts 12:21

On an appointed day, after putting on his royal apparel,  
Herod took his seat on the rostrum and began delivering an address to them.

## Acts 12:22

The people repeatedly cried out,  
“The voice of a god, and not of a man!”

## Acts 12:23

And immediately an angel of the Lord struck him, because he did not give God the glory,  
and he was eaten by worms and died.

---

## Acts 12:24

But the word of the Lord continued to grow and to be multiplied.

## Acts 12:25

And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had fulfilled their mission,  
taking along with them John, who was also called Mark.
