# Acts Chapter 11

## Acts 11:1

Now the apostles and the brothers and sisters who were throughout Judea  
heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.

## Acts 11:2

And when Peter came up to Jerusalem, the Jewish believers took issue with him,

## Acts 11:3

saying, “You went to uncircumcised men and ate with them.”

## Acts 11:4

But Peter began and explained at length to them in an orderly sequence, saying,

## Acts 11:5

“I was in the city of Joppa praying; and in a trance I saw a vision,  
an object coming down like a great sheet lowered by four corners from the sky,  
and it came right down to me,

## Acts 11:6

and I stared at it and was thinking about it, and I saw the four-footed animals of the earth,  
the wild animals, the crawling creatures, and the birds of the sky.

## Acts 11:7

I also heard a voice saying to me, ‘Get up, Peter; kill and eat.’

## Acts 11:8

But I said, ‘By no means, Lord, for nothing unholy or unclean has ever entered my mouth.’

## Acts 11:9

But a voice from heaven answered a second time,  
‘What God has cleansed, no longer consider unholy.’

## Acts 11:10

This happened three times, and everything was drawn back up into the sky.

## Acts 11:11

And behold, immediately three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea came to the house where we were staying.

## Acts 11:12

And the Spirit told me to go with them without misgivings.  
These six brothers also went with me, and we entered the man’s house.

## Acts 11:13

And he reported to us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying,  
‘Send some men to Joppa and have Simon, who is also called Peter, brought here;

## Acts 11:14

and he will speak words to you by which you will be saved, you and all your household.’

## Acts 11:15

And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them just as He did upon us at the beginning.

## Acts 11:16

And I remembered the word of the Lord, how He used to say,  
‘John baptised with water, but you will be baptised with the Holy Spirit.’

## Acts 11:17

Therefore, if God gave them the same gift as He also gave to us after believing in the Lord Jesus Christ,  
who was I that I could stand in God’s way?”

## Acts 11:18

When they heard this, they quieted down and glorified God, saying,  
“Well then, God has also granted to the Gentiles the repentance that leads to life.”

## Acts 11:19

So then those who were scattered because of the persecution that occurred in connection with Stephen  
made their way to Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except to Jews alone.

## Acts 11:20

But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene,  
who came to Antioch and began speaking to the Greeks as well, preaching the good news of the Lord Jesus.

## Acts 11:21

And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a large number who believed turned to the Lord.

## Acts 11:22

The news about them reached the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas off to Antioch.

## Acts 11:23

Then when he arrived and witnessed the grace of God, he rejoiced and began to encourage them all  
with resolute heart to remain true to the Lord;

## Acts 11:24

for he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and faith.  
And considerable numbers were added to the Lord.

## Acts 11:25

And he left for Tarsus to look for Saul;

## Acts 11:26

and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch.  
And for an entire year they met with the church and taught considerable numbers of people;  
and the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.

## Acts 11:27

Now at this time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.

## Acts 11:28

One of them, named Agabus, stood up and indicated by the Spirit  
that a severe famine would take place all over the world.  
And this took place during the reign of Claudius.

## Acts 11:29

And to the extent that any of the disciples had means,  
each of them determined to send a contribution for the relief of the brothers and sisters living in Judea.

## Acts 11:30

And they did this, sending it with Barnabas and Saul to the elders.
