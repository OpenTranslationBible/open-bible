# Acts Chapter 15

## Acts 15:1

Some men came down from Judea and began teaching the brothers,  
“Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.”

## Acts 15:2

And after Paul and Barnabas had a heated argument and debate with them,  
the brothers determined that Paul and Barnabas and some others of them should go up to Jerusalem  
to the apostles and elders concerning this issue.

## Acts 15:3

Therefore, after being sent on their way by the church,  
they were passing through both Phoenicia and Samaria,  
describing in detail the conversion of the Gentiles,  
and they were bringing great joy to all the brothers and sisters.

## Acts 15:4

When they arrived in Jerusalem, they were received by the church, the apostles, and the elders,  
and they reported all that God had done with them.

## Acts 15:5

But some of the sect of the Pharisees who had believed stood up, saying,  
“It is necessary to circumcise them and to direct them to keep the Law of Moses.”

---

## Acts 15:6

The apostles and the elders came together to look into this matter.

## Acts 15:7

After there had been much debate, Peter stood up and said to them,  
“Brothers, you know that in the early days God made a choice among you,  
that by my mouth the Gentiles would hear the word of the gospel and believe.

## Acts 15:8

And God, who knows the heart, testified to them giving them the Holy Spirit, just as He also did to us;

## Acts 15:9

and He made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith.

## Acts 15:10

Since this is the case, why are you putting God to the test  
by placing upon the neck of the disciples a yoke that neither our forefathers nor we have been able to bear?

## Acts 15:11

But we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in the same way as they also are.”

## Acts 15:12

All the people kept silent, and they were listening to Barnabas and Paul  
as they were relating all the signs and wonders that God had done through them among the Gentiles.

## Acts 15:13

After they stopped speaking, James responded, saying,  
“Brothers, listen to me.

## Acts 15:14

Simeon has described how God first concerned Himself about taking a people for His name from among the Gentiles.

## Acts 15:15

The words of the Prophets agree with this, just as it is written:

## Acts 15:16

> ‘After these things I will return,  
> And I will rebuild the fallen tent of David,  
> And I will rebuild its ruins,  
> And I will restore it,

## Acts 15:17

> So that the rest of mankind may seek the Lord,  
> And all the Gentiles who are called by My name,’

## Acts 15:18

> Says the Lord, who makes these things known from long ago.

## Acts 15:19

Therefore, it is my judgment that we do not cause trouble for those from the Gentiles who are turning to God,

## Acts 15:20

but that we write to them that they abstain from things contaminated by idols,  
from sexual immorality, from what has been strangled, and from blood.

## Acts 15:21

For from ancient generations Moses has those who preach him in every city,  
since he is read in the synagogues every Sabbath.”

## Acts 15:22

Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church,  
to choose men from among them to send to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas:  
Judas who was called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brothers,

## Acts 15:23

and they sent this letter with them:  
“The apostles and the brothers who are elders,  
To the brothers and sisters in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia who are from the Gentiles: Greetings.

## Acts 15:24

Since we have heard that some of our number to whom we gave no instruction  
have confused you by their teaching, upsetting your souls,

## Acts 15:25

it seemed good to us, having become of one mind, to select men to send to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,

## Acts 15:26

men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

## Acts 15:27

Therefore, we have sent Judas and Silas, who themselves will also report the same things by word of mouth.

## Acts 15:28

For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us  
to lay upon you no greater burden than these essentials:

## Acts 15:29

that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from sexual immorality;  
if you keep yourselves free from such things, you will do well. Farewell.”

## Acts 15:30

So when they were sent away, they went down to Antioch;  
and after gathering the congregation together, they delivered the letter.

## Acts 15:31

When they had read it, they rejoiced because of its encouragement.

## Acts 15:32

Judas and Silas, also being prophets themselves, encouraged and strengthened the brothers and sisters with a lengthy message.

## Acts 15:33

After they had spent time there, they were sent away from the brothers and sisters in peace to those who had sent them out.

## Acts 15:34

[But it seemed good to Silas to remain there.]

## Acts 15:35

But Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.

---

## Acts 15:36

Now after some days Paul said to Barnabas,  
“Let’s return and visit the brothers and sisters in every city in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they are.”

## Acts 15:37

Barnabas wanted to take John, called Mark, along with them also.

## Acts 15:38

But Paul was of the opinion that they should not take him along,  
who had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the work.

## Acts 15:39

Now it turned into such a sharp disagreement that they separated from one another,  
and Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus.

## Acts 15:40

But Paul chose Silas and left after being entrusted by the brothers to the grace of the Lord.

## Acts 15:41

And he was travelling through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.
