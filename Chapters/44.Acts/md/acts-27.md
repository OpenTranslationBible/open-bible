# Acts Chapter 27

## Acts 27:1

Now when it was decided that we would sail for Italy,  
they proceeded to turn Paul and some other prisoners over to a centurion of the Augustan cohort named Julius.

## Acts 27:2

And we boarded an Adramyttian ship that was about to sail to the regions along the coast of Asia,  
and put out to sea, accompanied by Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica.

## Acts 27:3

The next day we put in at Sidon; and Julius treated Paul with consideration  
and allowed him to go to his friends and receive care.

## Acts 27:4

From there we put out to sea and sailed under the shelter of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.

## Acts 27:5

When we had sailed through the sea along the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia,  
we landed at Myra in Lycia.

## Acts 27:6

There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy, and he put us aboard it.

## Acts 27:7

When we had sailed slowly for a good many days, and with difficulty had arrived off Cnidus,  
since the wind did not permit us to go farther, we sailed under the shelter of Crete, off Salmone;

## Acts 27:8

and after sailing along it with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens,  
near which was the city of Lasea.

## Acts 27:9

When considerable time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous,  
since even the fast was already over, Paul repeatedly warned them,

## Acts 27:10

and said to them,  
“Men, I perceive that the voyage is going to certainly be with damage and great loss,  
not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.”

## Acts 27:11

But the centurion was more persuaded by the pilot and the captain of the ship than by what was being said by Paul.

## Acts 27:12

Since the harbour was not suitable for wintering, the majority reached a decision to put out to sea from there,  
if somehow they could reach Phoenix, a harbour of Crete facing southwest and northwest, and spend the winter there.

## Acts 27:13

When a moderate south wind came up, thinking that they had attained their purpose,  
they weighed anchor and began sailing along Crete, closer to shore.

## Acts 27:14

But before very long a violent wind, called Euraquilo, rushed down from the land;

## Acts 27:15

and when the ship was caught in it and could not head into the wind, we gave up and let it be driven along.

## Acts 27:16

Running under the shelter of a small island called Cauda,  
we were able to get the ship’s boat under control only with difficulty.

## Acts 27:17

After they had hoisted it up, they used supporting cables in undergirding the ship;  
and fearing that they might run aground on the shallows of Syrtis,  
they let down the sea anchor and let themselves be driven along in this way.

## Acts 27:18

The next day as we were being violently tossed by the storm, they began to jettison the cargo;

## Acts 27:19

and on the third day they threw the ship’s tackle overboard with their own hands.

## Acts 27:20

Since neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small storm was assailing us,  
from then on all hope of our being saved was gradually abandoned.

## Acts 27:21

When many had gone without food for a long time,  
Paul stood among them and said,  
“Men, you should have followed my advice and not have set sail from Crete,  
and thereby spared yourselves this damage and loss.

## Acts 27:22

And yet now I urge you to keep up your courage,  
for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.

## Acts 27:23

For this very night an angel of the God to whom I belong, whom I also serve, came to me,

## Acts 27:24

saying, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul; you must stand before Caesar;  
and behold, God has graciously granted you all those who are sailing with you.’

## Acts 27:25

Therefore, keep up your courage, men, for I believe God that it will turn out exactly as I have been told.

## Acts 27:26

But we must run aground on a certain island.”

---

## Acts 27:27

But when the fourteenth night came, as we were being driven about in the Adriatic Sea,  
about midnight the sailors began to suspect that they were approaching some land.

## Acts 27:28

They took soundings and found it to be twenty fathoms;  
and a little farther on they took another sounding and found it to be fifteen fathoms.

## Acts 27:29

And fearing that we might run aground somewhere on the rocks,  
they cast four anchors from the stern and prayed for daybreak.

## Acts 27:30

But as the sailors were trying to escape from the ship  
and had let down the ship’s boat into the sea on the pretense that they were going to lay out anchors from the bow,

## Acts 27:31

Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers,  
“Unless these men remain on the ship, you yourselves cannot be saved.”

## Acts 27:32

Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the ship’s boat and let it drift away.

---

## Acts 27:33

Until the day was about to dawn, Paul kept encouraging them all to take some food, saying,  
“Today is the fourteenth day that you have been constantly watching and going without eating, having taken nothing.

## Acts 27:34

Therefore, I encourage you to take some food, for this is for your survival,  
for not a hair from the head of any of you will perish.”

## Acts 27:35

Having said this, he took bread and gave thanks to God in the presence of them all,  
and he broke it and began to eat.

## Acts 27:36

All of them were encouraged and they themselves also took food.

## Acts 27:37

We were 276 people on the ship in all.

## Acts 27:38

When they had eaten enough, they began lightening the ship by throwing the wheat out into the sea.

---

## Acts 27:39

Now when day came, they could not recognise the land;  
but they did notice a bay with a beach, and they resolved to run the ship ashore there if they could.

## Acts 27:40

And casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea,  
while at the same time they loosened the ropes of the rudders;  
and hoisting the foresail to the wind, they headed for the beach.

## Acts 27:41

But they struck a reef where two seas met, and they ran the ship aground;  
and the bow stuck firmly and remained immovable,  
but the stern began to break up by the force of the waves.

## Acts 27:42

Now the soldiers’ plan was to kill the prisoners,  
so that none of them would swim away and escape;

## Acts 27:43

but the centurion, wanting to bring Paul safely through, kept them from carrying out their plan,  
and he ordered that those who could swim were to jump overboard first and get to land,

## Acts 27:44

and the rest were to follow, some on planks, and others on various things from the ship.  
And so it happened that they all were brought safely to land.
