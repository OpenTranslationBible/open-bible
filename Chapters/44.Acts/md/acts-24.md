# Acts Chapter 24

## Acts 24:1

Now after five days the high priest Ananias came down with some elders and an attorney named Tertullus,  
and they brought charges against Paul to the governor.

## Acts 24:2

After Paul had been summoned, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying to the governor,  
“Since we have attained great peace through you,  
and since reforms are being carried out for this nation by your foresight,

## Acts 24:3

we acknowledge this in every way and everywhere, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.

## Acts 24:4

But, that I may not weary you any further, I beg you to grant us a brief hearing, by your kindness.

## Acts 24:5

For we have found this man to be a public menace and one who stirs up dissensions among all the Jews throughout the world,  
and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.

## Acts 24:6

And he even tried to desecrate the temple, so indeed we arrested him.

## Acts 24:7

[Omitted in some manuscripts.]

## Acts 24:8

By interrogating him yourself concerning all these matters, you will be able to ascertain the things of which we are accusing him.”

## Acts 24:9

The Jews also joined in the attack, asserting that these things were so.

## Acts 24:10

And when the governor had nodded for him to speak,  
Paul responded:  
“Knowing that you have been a judge to this nation for many years,  
I cheerfully make my defense.

## Acts 24:11

Since you can take note of the fact that no more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship.

## Acts 24:12

And neither in the temple did they find me carrying on a discussion with anyone or causing a riot,  
nor in the synagogues, nor in the city itself.

## Acts 24:13

Nor can they prove to you the things of which they now accuse me.

## Acts 24:14

But I confess this to you, that in accordance with the Way, which they call a sect,  
I do serve the God of our fathers, believing everything that is in accordance with the Law  
and is written in the Prophets;

## Acts 24:15

having a hope in God, which these men cherish themselves,  
that there shall certainly be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked.

## Acts 24:16

In view of this I also do my best to maintain a blameless conscience both before God and before other people, always.

## Acts 24:17

Now after several years I came to bring charitable gifts to my nation and to present offerings,

## Acts 24:18

in which they found me in the temple, after having been purified,  
without any crowd or uproar. But there were some Jews from Asia—

## Acts 24:19

who ought to have been present before you and to have been bringing charges, if they should have anything against me.

## Acts 24:20

Or else have these men themselves declare what wrongdoing they found when I stood before the Council,

## Acts 24:21

other than in regard to this one declaration which I shouted while standing among them:  
‘For the resurrection of the dead I am on trial before you today!’”

## Acts 24:22

But Felix, having a more exact understanding about the Way, put them off, saying,  
“When Lysias the commander comes down, I will decide your case.”

## Acts 24:23

He gave orders to the centurion for Paul to be kept in custody and yet have some freedom,  
and not to prevent any of his friends from providing for his needs.

## Acts 24:24

Now some days later Felix arrived with Drusilla his wife, who was Jewish,  
and he sent for Paul and heard him speak about faith in Christ Jesus.

## Acts 24:25

But as he was discussing righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come,  
Felix became frightened and responded, “Go away for now, and when I have an opportunity, I will summon you.”

## Acts 24:26

At the same time he was also hoping that money would be given to him by Paul;  
so he also used to send for him quite often and talk with him.

## Acts 24:27

But after two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus;  
and Felix, wanting to do the Jews a favour, left Paul imprisoned.
