# Acts Chapter 23

## Acts 23:1

Now looking intently at the Council, Paul said,  
“Brothers, I have lived my life with an entirely good conscience before God to this day.”

## Acts 23:2

But the high priest Ananias commanded those standing beside him to strike him on the mouth.

## Acts 23:3

Then Paul said to him,  
“God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall!  
Do you sit to try me according to the Law, and in violation of the Law order me to be struck?”

## Acts 23:4

But those present said, “Are you insulting God’s high priest?”

## Acts 23:5

And Paul said,  
“I was not aware, brothers, that he is high priest;  
for it is written: ‘You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.’”

## Acts 23:6

But Paul, perceiving that one group were Sadducees and the other Pharisees,  
began crying out in the Council,  
“Brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees;  
I am on trial for the hope and resurrection of the dead!”

## Acts 23:7

When he said this, a dissension occurred between the Pharisees and Sadducees,  
and the assembly was divided.

## Acts 23:8

For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit,  
but the Pharisees acknowledge them all.

## Acts 23:9

And a great uproar occurred; and some of the scribes of the Pharisaic party stood up and argued vehemently, saying,  
“We find nothing wrong with this man; suppose a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?”

## Acts 23:10

And when a great dissension occurred, the commander was afraid Paul would be torn to pieces by them,  
and he ordered the troops to go down and take him away from them by force, and bring him into the barracks.

## Acts 23:11

But on the following night, the Lord stood by him and said,  
“Take courage; for as you have solemnly testified about Me in Jerusalem,  
so you must testify in Rome also.”

---

## Acts 23:12

When it was day, the Jews formed a conspiracy and put themselves under an oath,  
saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.

## Acts 23:13

There were more than forty who formed this plot.

## Acts 23:14

They came to the chief priests and the elders and said,  
“We have put ourselves under an oath to taste nothing until we have killed Paul.

## Acts 23:15

Now therefore, you and the Council notify the commander to bring him down to you,  
as though you were going to determine his case more thoroughly;  
and we, for our part, are ready to kill him before he comes near the place.”

## Acts 23:16

But the son of Paul’s sister heard about their ambush,  
and he came and entered the barracks and told Paul.

## Acts 23:17

Paul called one of the centurions to himself and said,  
“Take this young man to the commander, for he has something to report to him.”

## Acts 23:18

So he took him and led him to the commander and _said_,  
“Paul the prisoner called me and asked me to lead this young man to you,  
since he has something to tell you.”

## Acts 23:19

The commander took him by the hand and stepping aside, began to inquire of him privately,  
“What is it that you have to report to me?”

## Acts 23:20

And he said,  
“The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down tomorrow to the Council,  
as though they are going to inquire somewhat more thoroughly about him.

## Acts 23:21

So do not listen to them, for more than forty of them are in hiding to set an ambush for him,  
and they have put themselves under an oath not to eat or drink until they kill him;  
and now they are ready, waiting for your promise.”

## Acts 23:22

So the commander let the young man go, instructing him,  
“Tell no one that you have notified me of these things.”

---

## Acts 23:23

And he called for two of the centurions and said,  
“Get two hundred soldiers ready by the third hour of the night to proceed to Caesarea,  
with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen.”

## Acts 23:24

They were also to provide mounts for Paul to put him on and bring him safely to Felix the governor.

---

## Acts 23:25

And he wrote a letter with the following content:

## Acts 23:26

“Claudius Lysias,  
to the most excellent governor Felix: Greetings.

## Acts 23:27

When this man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them,  
I came up to them with the troops and rescued him, after learning that he was a Roman.

## Acts 23:28

And wanting to ascertain the basis for the charges they were bringing against him,  
I brought him down to their Council;

## Acts 23:29

and I found that he was being accused regarding questions in their Law,  
but was not charged with anything deserving death or imprisonment.

## Acts 23:30

When I was informed that there would be a plot against the man,  
I sent him to you immediately, also instructing his accusers to bring charges against him before you.”

---

## Acts 23:31

So the soldiers, in accordance with their orders, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.

## Acts 23:32

But on the next day, leaving the horsemen to go on with him, they returned to the barracks.

## Acts 23:33

When these horsemen had come to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor,  
they also presented Paul to him.

## Acts 23:34

Now when he had read the letter, he asked what province he was from,  
and when he learned that he was from Cilicia,

## Acts 23:35

he said, “I will give you a hearing when your accusers arrive as well,”  
giving orders for him to be kept in Herod’s Praetorium.
