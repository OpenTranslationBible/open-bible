## 2 Kings 25:1

Now in the ninth year of his reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month,  
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem,  
camped against it, and built a siege wall all around it.

## 2 Kings 25:2

So the city came under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.

## 2 Kings 25:3

On the ninth day of the fourth month, the famine was severe in the city,  
so that there was no food for the people of the land.

## 2 Kings 25:4

Then the city was breached, and all the men of war fled by night  
by way of the gate between the two walls beside the king’s garden,  
though the Chaldeans were all around the city.  
And they went by way of the Arabah.

## 2 Kings 25:5

But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king,  
and overtook him in the plains of Jericho,  
and all his army was scattered from him.

## 2 Kings 25:6

Then they captured the king and brought him to the king of Babylon at Riblah,  
and he passed sentence on him.

## 2 Kings 25:7

And they slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes,  
then put out the eyes of Zedekiah and bound him with bronze shackles,  
and brought him to Babylon.

## 2 Kings 25:8

Now on the seventh day of the fifth month,  
which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon,  
Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.

## 2 Kings 25:9

And he burned the house of the Lord, the king’s house,  
and all the houses of Jerusalem;  
even every large house he burned with fire.

## 2 Kings 25:10

So all the army of the Chaldeans who were with the captain of the guard  
tore down the walls around Jerusalem.

## 2 Kings 25:11

Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard  
led into exile the rest of the people who were left in the city,  
the deserters who had deserted to the king of Babylon,  
and the rest of the population.

## 2 Kings 25:12

But the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and farmers.

## 2 Kings 25:13

Now the bronze pillars which were in the house of the Lord,  
and the stands and the bronze sea which were in the house of the Lord,  
the Chaldeans broke in pieces and carried the bronze to Babylon.

## 2 Kings 25:14

They also took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the spoons,  
and all the bronze utensils used in temple service.

## 2 Kings 25:15

The captain of the guard also took away the firepans and the basins,  
whatever was fine gold and whatever was fine silver.

## 2 Kings 25:16

The two pillars, the one sea, and the stands  
which Solomon had made for the house of the Lord—  
the bronze of all these vessels was beyond weight.

## 2 Kings 25:17

The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits,  
and a bronze capital was on it;  
the height of the capital was three cubits,  
with latticework and pomegranates on the capital all around, all of bronze.  
And the second pillar was like these, with latticework.

## 2 Kings 25:18

Then the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest,  
and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three doorkeepers.

## 2 Kings 25:19

And from the city he took one official who was overseer of the men of war,  
five of the king’s advisers who were found in the city,  
the scribe of the captain of the army who mustered the people of the land,  
and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the city.

## 2 Kings 25:20

Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them  
and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.

## 2 Kings 25:21

Then the king of Babylon struck them and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath.  
So Judah was taken into exile from its land.

## 2 Kings 25:22

Now as for the people who were left in the land of Judah,  
whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left,  
he appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, over them.

## 2 Kings 25:23

When all the captains of the forces, they and their men, heard  
that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah governor,  
they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah,  
namely Ishmael the son of Nethaniah,  
Johanan the son of Kareah,  
Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite,  
and Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.

## 2 Kings 25:24

Then Gedaliah swore to them and to their men and said to them,  
“Do not be afraid of the servants of the Chaldeans;  
live in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well for you.”

## 2 Kings 25:25

But in the seventh month, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama,  
of the royal family, came with ten men and struck Gedaliah down so that he died,  
along with the Jews and the Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah.

## 2 Kings 25:26

Then all the people, from small to great, and the captains of the forces,  
arose and went to Egypt,  
for they were afraid of the Chaldeans.

## 2 Kings 25:27

Now it came about in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah,  
on the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth month,  
that Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he became king,  
released Jehoiachin king of Judah from prison.

## 2 Kings 25:28

And he spoke kindly to him and set his throne above the thrones of the kings who were with him in Babylon.

## 2 Kings 25:29

So Jehoiachin changed his prison clothes,  
and had his meals in the king’s presence regularly all the days of his life.

## 2 Kings 25:30

And for his allowance, a regular allowance was given him by the king,  
a portion for each day, all the days of his life.
