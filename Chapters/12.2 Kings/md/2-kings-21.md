# 2 Kings Chapter 21

## 2 Kings 21:1

Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king,  
and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem.  
And his mother’s name was Hephzibah.

## 2 Kings 21:2

He did evil in the sight of the Lord,  
in accordance with the abominations of the nations  
whom the Lord dispossessed before the sons of Israel.

## 2 Kings 21:3

For he rebuilt the high places which his father Hezekiah had destroyed;  
and he erected altars for Baal and made an Asherah,  
just as Ahab king of Israel had done,  
and he bowed down to all the host of heaven and served them.

## 2 Kings 21:4

He also built altars in the house of the Lord,  
of which the Lord had said,  
“In Jerusalem I will put My name.”

## 2 Kings 21:5

For he built altars for all the host of heaven  
in the two courtyards of the house of the Lord.

## 2 Kings 21:6

And he made his son pass through the fire,  
practised witchcraft and used divination,  
and dealt with mediums and spiritists.  
He did much evil in the sight of the Lord, provoking Him to anger.

## 2 Kings 21:7

Then he put the carved image of Asherah  
that he had made in the house of which the Lord had said to David and to his son Solomon,  
“In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel,  
I will put My name forever.

## 2 Kings 21:8

And I will not make the feet of Israel wander again from the land which I gave their fathers,  
if only they will be careful to do all that I have commanded them,  
according to all the Law that My servant Moses commanded them.”

## 2 Kings 21:9

But they did not listen,  
and Manasseh led them astray to do more evil  
than the nations whom the Lord destroyed before the sons of Israel.

## 2 Kings 21:10

Now the Lord spoke through His servants the prophets, saying,

## 2 Kings 21:11

“Since Manasseh king of Judah has committed these abominations,  
having done more evil than the Amorites who were before him,  
and has also made Judah sin with his idols,

## 2 Kings 21:12

therefore this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says:

> ‘Behold, I am bringing such disaster on Jerusalem and Judah,  
> that whoever hears of it, both ears will tingle.

## 2 Kings 21:13

> And I will stretch over Jerusalem the measuring line of Samaria,  
> and the plumb line of the house of Ahab,  
> and I will wipe Jerusalem as one wipes a dish,  
> wiping it and turning it upside down.

## 2 Kings 21:14

> And I will abandon the remnant of My inheritance  
> and hand them over to their enemies,  
> and they will become as plunder and spoils to all their enemies,

## 2 Kings 21:15

> because they have done what is evil in My sight,  
> and have been provoking Me to anger since the day their fathers came from Egypt, even to this day.’”

## 2 Kings 21:16

Moreover, Manasseh shed very much innocent blood  
until he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another,  
besides his sin into which he led Judah,  
in doing evil in the sight of the Lord.

## 2 Kings 21:17

Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh and all that he did,  
and his sin which he committed,  
are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?

## 2 Kings 21:18

And Manasseh lay down with his fathers  
and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza,  
and his son Amon became king in his place.

---

## 2 Kings 21:19

Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king,  
and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.  
And his mother’s name was Meshullemeth the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.

## 2 Kings 21:20

He did evil in the sight of the Lord,  
just as his father Manasseh had done.

## 2 Kings 21:21

For he walked in all the ways that his father had walked,  
and served the idols that his father had served, and bowed down to them.

## 2 Kings 21:22

So he abandoned the Lord, the God of his fathers,  
and did not walk in the way of the Lord.

## 2 Kings 21:23

And the servants of Amon conspired against him  
and killed the king in his own house.

## 2 Kings 21:24

Then the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against King Amon,  
and the people of the land made his son Josiah king in his place.

---

## 2 Kings 21:25

Now the rest of the acts of Amon, which he did,  
are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?

## 2 Kings 21:26

And he was buried in his grave in the garden of Uzza,  
and his son Josiah became king in his place.
