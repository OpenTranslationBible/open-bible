# Isaiah Chapter 65

## Isaiah 65:1  
“I permitted Myself to be sought by those who did not ask for Me;  
I permitted Myself to be found by those who did not seek Me.  
I said, ‘Here I am, here I am,’  
To a nation which did not call on My name.

## Isaiah 65:2  
I have spread out My hands all day long to a rebellious people,  
Who walk in the way which is not good, following their own thoughts,

## Isaiah 65:3  
A people who continually provoke Me to My face,  
Offering sacrifices in gardens and burning incense on bricks;

## Isaiah 65:4  
Who sit among graves and spend the night in secret places;  
Who eat pig’s flesh,  
And the broth of unclean meat is in their pots.

## Isaiah 65:5  
Who say, ‘Keep to yourself, do not come near me,  
For I am holier than you!’  
These are smoke in My nostrils,  
A fire that burns all the day.

## Isaiah 65:6  
Behold, it is written before Me:  
I will not keep silent, but I will repay;  
I will even repay into their laps,

## Isaiah 65:7  
Both your own wrongdoings and the wrongdoings of your fathers together,” says the Lord.  
“Because they have burned incense on the mountains  
And scorned Me on the hills,  
Therefore I will measure their former work into their laps.”

## Isaiah 65:8  
This is what the Lord says:  
“Just as the new wine is found in the cluster,  
And one says, ‘Do not destroy it, for there is benefit in it,’  
So I will act in behalf of My servants,  
In order not to destroy all of them.

## Isaiah 65:9  
I will bring forth offspring from Jacob,  
And an heir of My mountains from Judah;  
My chosen ones shall inherit it,  
And My servants will live there.

## Isaiah 65:10  
Sharon will be a pasture land for flocks,  
And the Valley of Achor a resting place for herds,  
For My people who seek Me.

## Isaiah 65:11  
But as for you who abandon the Lord,  
Who forget My holy mountain,  
Who set a table for Fortune,  
And fill a jug of mixed wine for Destiny,

## Isaiah 65:12  
I will destine you for the sword,  
And all of you will bow down to the slaughter.  
Because I called, but you did not answer;  
I spoke, but you did not listen.  
Instead, you did evil in My sight  
And chose that in which I did not delight.”

## Isaiah 65:13  
Therefore, this is what the Lord God says:  
“Behold, My servants will eat, but you will be hungry.  
Behold, My servants will drink, but you will be thirsty.  
Behold, My servants will rejoice, but you will be put to shame.

## Isaiah 65:14  
Behold, My servants will shout joyfully with a glad heart,  
But you will cry out with a heavy heart,  
And you will wail with a broken spirit.

## Isaiah 65:15  
You will leave your name as a curse to My chosen ones,  
And the Lord God will put you to death.  
But My servants will be called by another name.

## Isaiah 65:16  
Because the one who is blessed on the earth  
Will be blessed by the God of truth;  
And the one who swears an oath on the earth  
Will swear by the God of truth;  
Because the former troubles are forgotten,  
And because they are hidden from My sight!

## Isaiah 65:17  
“For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth;  
And the former things will not be remembered or come to mind.

## Isaiah 65:18  
But be glad and rejoice forever in what I create;  
For behold, I create Jerusalem for rejoicing  
And her people for gladness.

## Isaiah 65:19  
I will also rejoice in Jerusalem and be glad in My people;  
And there will no longer be heard in her  
The voice of weeping and the sound of crying.

## Isaiah 65:20  
No longer will there be in it an infant who lives only a few days,  
Or an old person who does not live out his days;  
For the youth will die at the age of a hundred,  
And the one who does not reach the age of a hundred  
Will be thought accursed.

## Isaiah 65:21  
They will build houses and inhabit them;  
They will also plant vineyards and eat their fruit.

## Isaiah 65:22  
They will not build and another inhabit,  
They will not plant and another eat;  
For as the lifetime of a tree, so will be the days of My people,  
And My chosen ones will fully enjoy the work of their hands.

## Isaiah 65:23  
They will not labor in vain,  
Or give birth to children for disaster;  
For they are the descendants of those blessed by the Lord,  
And their descendants with them.

## Isaiah 65:24  
It will also come to pass that before they call, I will answer;  
While they are still speaking, I will listen.

## Isaiah 65:25  
The wolf and the lamb will graze together,  
And the lion will eat straw like the ox;  
And dust will be the serpent’s food.  
They will do no evil nor harm on all My holy mountain,”  
Says the Lord.
