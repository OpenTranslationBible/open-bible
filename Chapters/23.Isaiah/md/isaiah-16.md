# Isaiah Chapter 16

## Isaiah 16:1  
Send the tribute lamb to the ruler of the land,  
From Sela by way of the wilderness  
To the mountain of the daughter of Zion.

## Isaiah 16:2  
Then, like fleeing birds or scattered nestlings,  
The daughters of Moab will be at the fords of the Arnon.

## Isaiah 16:3  
“Give us advice, make a decision;  
Cast your shadow like night at high noon;  
Hide the outcasts, do not reveal the fugitive.

## Isaiah 16:4  
Let the outcasts of Moab stay with you;  
Be a hiding place to them from the destroyer.”  
For the oppressor has come to an end, destruction has ceased,  
Oppressors have been removed from the land.

## Isaiah 16:5  
A throne will be established in faithfulness,  
And a judge will sit on it in trustworthiness in the tent of David;  
Moreover, he will seek justice,  
And be prompt in righteousness.

## Isaiah 16:6  
We have heard of the pride of Moab—an excessive pride—  
Even of his arrogance, pride, and fury;  
His idle boasts are false.

## Isaiah 16:7  
Therefore Moab will wail; everyone of Moab will wail.  
You will moan for the raisin cakes of Kir-hareseth  
As those who are utterly stricken.

## Isaiah 16:8  
For the fields of Heshbon have withered, the vines of Sibmah as well;  
The lords of the nations have trampled down its choice clusters  
Which reached as far as Jazer and wandered to the deserts;  
Its tendrils spread themselves out and passed over the sea.

## Isaiah 16:9  
Therefore I will weep bitterly for Jazer, for the vine of Sibmah;  
I will drench you with my tears, Heshbon and Elealeh;  
For the shouting over your summer fruits and your harvest has fallen away.

## Isaiah 16:10  
Gladness and joy are taken away from the fruitful field;  
In the vineyards also there will be no cries of joy or jubilant shouting,  
No treader treads out wine in the presses,  
For I have made the shouting to cease.

## Isaiah 16:11  
Therefore my inner being moans like a harp for Moab,  
And my heart for Kir-hareseth.

## Isaiah 16:12  
So it will come about when Moab presents himself,  
When he wearies himself upon his high place  
And comes to his sanctuary to pray,  
That he will not prevail.

## Isaiah 16:13  
This is the word which the Lord spoke previously about Moab.

## Isaiah 16:14  
But now the Lord speaks, saying, “Within three years, as a hired worker would count them,  
The glory of Moab will become contemptible with all its great population,  
And the remnant will be very small and insignificant.”
