# Isaiah Chapter 54

## Isaiah 54:1  
Shout for joy, infertile one, you who have not given birth;  
Break forth into joyful shouting and cry aloud, you who have not been in labor;  
For the sons of the desolate one will be more numerous  
Than the sons of the married woman,” says the Lord.

## Isaiah 54:2  
“Enlarge the place of your tent;  
Stretch out the curtains of your dwellings, do not spare them;  
Lengthen your ropes  
And strengthen your pegs.

## Isaiah 54:3  
For you will spread out to the right and to the left.  
And your descendants will possess nations  
And will resettle the desolate cities.

## Isaiah 54:4  
Do not fear, for you will not be put to shame;  
And do not feel humiliated, for you will not be disgraced;  
But you will forget the shame of your youth,  
And no longer remember the disgrace of your widowhood.

## Isaiah 54:5  
For your husband is your Maker,  
Whose name is the Lord of armies;  
And your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel,  
Who is called the God of all the earth.

## Isaiah 54:6  
For the Lord has called you,  
Like a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit,  
Even like a wife of one’s youth when she is rejected,”  
Says your God.

## Isaiah 54:7  
“For a brief moment I abandoned you,  
But with great compassion I will gather you.

## Isaiah 54:8  
In an outburst of anger  
I hid My face from you for a moment,  
But with everlasting favor  
I will have compassion on you,”  
Says the Lord your Redeemer.

## Isaiah 54:9  
“For this is like the days of Noah to Me,  
When I swore that the waters of Noah  
Would not flood the earth again;  
So I have sworn that I will not be angry with you  
Nor rebuke you.

## Isaiah 54:10  
For the mountains may be removed and the hills may shake,  
But My favor will not be removed from you,  
Nor will My covenant of peace be shaken,”  
Says the Lord who has compassion on you.
