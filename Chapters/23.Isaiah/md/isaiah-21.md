# Isaiah Chapter 21

## Isaiah 21:1  
The pronouncement concerning the wilderness of the sea:  
As windstorms in the Negev sweep along,  
It comes from the wilderness, from a terrifying land.

## Isaiah 21:2  
A harsh vision has been shown to me;  
The treacherous one still deals treacherously, and the destroyer still destroys.  
Go up, Elam, lay siege, Media;  
I have put an end to all the groaning she has caused.

## Isaiah 21:3  
For this reason my loins are full of anguish;  
Pains have seized me like the pains of a woman in labour.  
I am so bewildered I cannot hear, so terrified I cannot see.

## Isaiah 21:4  
My mind reels, horror overwhelms me;  
The twilight I longed for has been turned into trembling for me.

## Isaiah 21:5  
They set the table, they spread out the cloth, they eat, they drink;  
“Rise up, captains, oil the shields!”

## Isaiah 21:6  
For this is what the Lord says to me:  
“Go, station the lookout, have him report what he sees.

## Isaiah 21:7  
When he sees riders, horsemen in pairs,  
A train of donkeys, a train of camels,  
Let him pay close attention, very close attention.”

## Isaiah 21:8  
Then the lookout called,  
“Lord, I stand continually by day on the watchtower,  
And I am stationed every night at my guard post.

## Isaiah 21:9  
Now behold, here comes a troop of riders, horsemen in pairs.”  
And one said, “Fallen, fallen is Babylon;  
And all the images of her gods are shattered on the ground.”

## Isaiah 21:10  
My downtrodden people, and my afflicted of the threshing floor!  
What I have heard from the Lord of armies, the God of Israel,  
I make known to you.

## Isaiah 21:11  
The pronouncement concerning Edom:  
One keeps calling to me from Seir,  
“Watchman, how far gone is the night?  
Watchman, how far gone is the night?”

## Isaiah 21:12  
The watchman says,  
“Morning comes but also night.  
If you would inquire, inquire; come back again.”

---

## Isaiah 21:13  
The pronouncement about Arabia:  
In the thickets of Arabia you will spend the night,  
You caravans of Dedanites.

## Isaiah 21:14  
Bring water for the thirsty,  
You inhabitants of the land of Tema;  
Meet the fugitive with bread.

## Isaiah 21:15  
For they have fled from the swords,  
From the drawn sword, and from the bent bow,  
And from the press of battle.

## Isaiah 21:16  
For this is what the Lord said to me: “In a year, as a hired worker would count it,  
All the splendor of Kedar will come to an end;

## Isaiah 21:17  
and the remainder of the number of bowmen, the warriors of the sons of Kedar, will be few;  
for the Lord God of Israel has spoken.”
