# Isaiah Chapter 63

## Isaiah 63:1  
Who is this who comes from Edom,  
With garments of glowing colors from Bozrah,  
This One who is majestic in His apparel,  
Marching in the greatness of His strength?  
“It is I, the One who speaks in righteousness, mighty to save.”

## Isaiah 63:2  
Why is Your apparel red,  
And Your garments like one who treads in the wine press?

## Isaiah 63:3  
“I have trodden the wine trough alone,  
And from the peoples there was no one with Me.  
I also trampled them in My anger,  
And stomped them in My wrath;  
And their lifeblood is sprinkled on My garments,  
And I stained all My clothes.

## Isaiah 63:4  
For the day of vengeance was in My heart,  
And My year of redemption has come.

## Isaiah 63:5  
I looked, but there was no one to help,  
And I was amazed, and there was no one to uphold;  
So My own arm brought salvation to Me,  
And My wrath upheld Me.

## Isaiah 63:6  
I trampled down the peoples in My anger  
And made them drunk with My wrath,  
And I poured out their lifeblood on the earth.”

## Isaiah 63:7  
I will make mention of the mercies of the Lord,  
And the praises of the Lord,  
According to all that the Lord has granted us,  
And the great goodness toward the house of Israel,  
Which He has granted them according to His compassion  
And according to the abundance of His mercies.

## Isaiah 63:8  
For He said, “Certainly they are My people,  
Sons who will not deal falsely.”  
So He became their Savior.

## Isaiah 63:9  
In all their distress He was distressed,  
And the angel of His presence saved them;  
In His love and in His mercy He redeemed them,  
And He lifted them and carried them all the days of old.

## Isaiah 63:10  
But they rebelled  
And grieved His Holy Spirit;  
Therefore He turned Himself to become their enemy,  
He fought against them.

## Isaiah 63:11  
Then His people remembered the days of old, of Moses:  
Where is He who brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of His flock?  
Where is He who put His Holy Spirit in the midst of them,

## Isaiah 63:12  
Who caused His glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses,  
Who divided the waters before them to make an everlasting name for Himself,

## Isaiah 63:13  
Who led them through the depths?  
Like the horse in the wilderness, they did not stumble;

## Isaiah 63:14  
Like the cattle which go down into the valley,  
The Spirit of the Lord gave them rest.  
So You led Your people,  
To make for Yourself a glorious name.

## Isaiah 63:15  
Look down from heaven and see from Your holy and glorious lofty habitation;  
Where are Your zeal and Your mighty deeds?  
The stirrings of Your heart and Your compassion are restrained toward me.

## Isaiah 63:16  
For You are our Father, though Abraham does not know us  
And Israel does not recognize us.  
You, Lord, are our Father,  
Our Redeemer from ancient times is Your name.

## Isaiah 63:17  
Why, Lord, do You cause us to stray from Your ways  
And harden our heart from fearing You?  
Return for the sake of Your servants,  
The tribes of Your heritage.

## Isaiah 63:18  
Your holy people possessed Your sanctuary for a little while,  
Our adversaries have trampled it down.

## Isaiah 63:19  
We have become like those over whom You have never ruled,  
Like those who were not called by Your name.
