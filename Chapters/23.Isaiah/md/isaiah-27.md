# Isaiah Chapter 27

## Isaiah 27:1  
On that day the Lord will punish Leviathan the fleeing serpent,  
With His fierce and great and mighty sword,  
Even Leviathan the twisted serpent;  
And He will kill the dragon who lives in the sea.

## Isaiah 27:2  
On that day,  
“A vineyard of beauty, sing of it!

## Isaiah 27:3  
I, the Lord, am its keeper;  
I water it every moment.  
So that no one will damage it,  
I guard it night and day.

## Isaiah 27:4  
I have no wrath.  
Should someone give Me briars and thorns in battle,  
Then I would step on them, I would burn them completely.

## Isaiah 27:5  
Or let him rely on My protection,  
Let him make peace with Me,  
Let him make peace with Me.”

## Isaiah 27:6  
In the days to come Jacob will take root,  
Israel will blossom and sprout,  
And they will fill the surface of the world with fruit.

## Isaiah 27:7  
Like the striking of Him who has struck them, has He struck them?  
Or like the slaughter of His slain, have they been slain?

## Isaiah 27:8  
You contended with them by banishing them, by driving them away.  
With His fierce wind He has expelled them on the day of the east wind.

## Isaiah 27:9  
Therefore through this Jacob’s wrongdoing will be forgiven;  
And this will be the full price of the pardoning of his sin:  
When he makes all the altar stones like pulverized chalk stones;  
When Asherim and incense altars will not stand.

## Isaiah 27:10  
For the fortified city is isolated,  
A homestead deserted and abandoned like the desert;  
There the calf will graze, and there it will lie down  
And feed on its branches.

## Isaiah 27:11  
When its branches are dry, they are broken off;  
Women come and make a fire with them,  
For they are not a people of understanding.  
Therefore their Maker will not have compassion on them,  
And their Creator will not be gracious to them.

## Isaiah 27:12  
On that day the Lord will thresh from the flowing stream of the Euphrates to the brook of Egypt,  
And you will be gathered up one by one, sons of Israel.

## Isaiah 27:13  
On that day a great trumpet will be blown,  
And those who are perishing in the land of Assyria  
And who are scattered in the land of Egypt  
Will come and worship the Lord on the holy mountain in Jerusalem.
