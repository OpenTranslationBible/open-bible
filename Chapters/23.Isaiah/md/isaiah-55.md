# Isaiah Chapter 55

## Isaiah 55:1  
“Everyone who thirsts, come to the waters;  
And you who have no money, come, buy and eat.  
Come, buy wine and milk  
Without money and without cost.

## Isaiah 55:2  
Why do you spend money for what is not bread,  
And your wages for what does not satisfy?  
Listen carefully to Me, and eat what is good,  
And delight yourself in abundance.

## Isaiah 55:3  
Incline your ear and come to Me.  
Listen, that you may live;  
And I will make an everlasting covenant with you,  
According to the faithful mercies shown to David.

## Isaiah 55:4  
Behold, I have made him a witness to the peoples,  
A leader and commander for the peoples.

## Isaiah 55:5  
Behold, you will call a nation you do not know,  
And a nation which does not know you will run to you,  
Because of the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel;  
For He has glorified you.”

## Isaiah 55:6  
Seek the Lord while He may be found;  
Call upon Him while He is near.

## Isaiah 55:7  
Let the wicked abandon his way,  
And the unrighteous person his thoughts;  
And let him return to the Lord,  
And He will have compassion on him,  
And to our God,  
For He will abundantly pardon.

## Isaiah 55:8  
“For My thoughts are not your thoughts,  
Nor are your ways My ways,” declares the Lord.

## Isaiah 55:9  
“For as the heavens are higher than the earth,  
So are My ways higher than your ways  
And My thoughts than your thoughts.

## Isaiah 55:10  
For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven,  
And do not return there without watering the earth  
And making it produce and sprout,  
And providing seed to the sower and bread to the eater;

## Isaiah 55:11  
So will My word be which goes out of My mouth;  
It will not return to Me empty,  
Without accomplishing what I desire,  
And without succeeding in the purpose for which I sent it.

## Isaiah 55:12  
For you will go out with joy  
And be led in peace;  
The mountains and the hills will break into shouts of joy before you,  
And all the trees of the field will clap their hands.

## Isaiah 55:13  
Instead of the thorn bush, the juniper will come up,  
And instead of the stinging nettle, the myrtle will come up;  
And it will be a memorial to the Lord,  
An everlasting sign which will not be eliminated.”
