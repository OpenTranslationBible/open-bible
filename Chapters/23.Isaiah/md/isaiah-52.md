# Isaiah Chapter 52

## Isaiah 52:1  
Awake, awake, clothe yourself in your strength, Zion;  
Clothe yourself with your beautiful garments, Jerusalem, the holy city;  
For the uncircumcised and the unclean will no longer come into you.

## Isaiah 52:2  
Shake yourself from the dust, rise up,  
Captive Jerusalem;  
Release yourself from the chains around your neck,  
Captive daughter of Zion.

## Isaiah 52:3  
For this is what the Lord says:  
“You were sold for nothing, and you will be redeemed without money.”

## Isaiah 52:4  
For this is what the Lord God says:  
“My people first went down to Egypt to reside there, then the Assyrian oppressed them without reason.

## Isaiah 52:5  
And now, what do I have here,” declares the Lord, “seeing that My people have been taken away without reason?”  
Again the Lord declares, “Those who rule over them howl,  
And My name is continually reviled all day long.

## Isaiah 52:6  
Therefore My people shall know My name;  
Therefore on that day they will know that I am He who says, ‘Here I am.’”

## Isaiah 52:7  
How delightful on the mountains  
Are the feet of one who brings good news,  
Who announces peace  
And brings good news of happiness,  
Who announces salvation,  
And says to Zion, “Your God reigns!”

## Isaiah 52:8  
The voice of your watchmen! They raise their voices, they shout joyfully together;  
For they will see with their own eyes  
When the Lord restores Zion.

## Isaiah 52:9  
Be cheerful, shout joyfully together,  
You ruins of Jerusalem;  
For the Lord has comforted His people,  
He has redeemed Jerusalem.

## Isaiah 52:10  
The Lord has bared His holy arm  
In the sight of all the nations,  
So that all the ends of the earth may see  
The salvation of our God.

## Isaiah 52:11  
Depart, depart, go out from there,  
Do not touch what is unclean;  
Go out of the midst of her, purify yourselves,  
You who carry the vessels of the Lord.

## Isaiah 52:12  
But you will not go out in a hurry,  
Nor will you go as fugitives;  
For the Lord will go before you,  
And the God of Israel will be your rear guard.

## Isaiah 52:13  
Behold, My Servant will prosper,  
He will be high and lifted up, and greatly exalted.

## Isaiah 52:14  
Just as many were astonished at you, My people,  
So His appearance was marred beyond that of a man,  
And His form beyond the sons of mankind.

## Isaiah 52:15  
So He will sprinkle many nations,  
Kings will shut their mouths on account of Him;  
For what they had not been told, they will see,  
And what they had not heard, they will understand.
