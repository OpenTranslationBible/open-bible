# Isaiah Chapter 64

## Isaiah 64:1  
Oh, that You would tear open the heavens and come down,  
That the mountains would quake at Your presence—

## Isaiah 64:2  
As fire kindles brushwood, as fire causes water to boil—  
To make Your name known to Your adversaries,  
So that the nations may tremble at Your presence!

## Isaiah 64:3  
When You did awesome things which we did not expect,  
You came down, the mountains quaked at Your presence.

## Isaiah 64:4  
For from days of old they have not heard or perceived by ear,  
Nor has the eye seen a God besides You,  
Who acts in behalf of one who waits for Him.

## Isaiah 64:5  
You meet him who rejoices in doing righteousness,  
Who remembers You in Your ways.  
Behold, You were angry, for we sinned,  
We continued in our sins for a long time;  
Yet shall we be saved?

## Isaiah 64:6  
For all of us have become like one who is unclean,  
And all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment;  
And all of us wither like a leaf,  
And our wrongdoings, like the wind, take us away.

## Isaiah 64:7  
There is no one who calls on Your name,  
Who stirs himself to take hold of You;  
For You have hidden Your face from us  
And have surrendered us to the power of our wrongdoings.

## Isaiah 64:8  
But now, Lord, You are our Father;  
We are the clay, and You our potter,  
And all of us are the work of Your hand.

## Isaiah 64:9  
Do not be angry beyond measure, Lord,  
Nor remember wrongdoing forever.  
Behold, please look, all of us are Your people.

## Isaiah 64:10  
Your holy cities have become a wilderness,  
Zion has become a wilderness,  
Jerusalem a desolation.

## Isaiah 64:11  
Our holy and beautiful house,  
Where our fathers praised You,  
Has been burned by fire;  
And all our precious things have become a ruin.

## Isaiah 64:12  
Will You restrain Yourself at these things, Lord?  
Will You keep silent and afflict us beyond measure?
