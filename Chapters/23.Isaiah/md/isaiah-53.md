# Isaiah Chapter 53

## Isaiah 53:1  
Who has believed our report?  
And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?

## Isaiah 53:2  
For He grew up before Him like a tender shoot,  
And like a root out of dry ground;  
He had no stately form or majesty  
That we would look at Him,  
Nor an appearance that we would take pleasure in Him.

## Isaiah 53:3  
He was despised and abandoned by men,  
A man of great pain and familiar with sickness;  
And like one from whom people hide their faces,  
He was despised, and we had no regard for Him.

## Isaiah 53:4  
However, it was our sicknesses that He Himself bore,  
And our pains that He carried;  
Yet we ourselves assumed that He had been afflicted,  
Struck down by God, and humiliated.

## Isaiah 53:5  
But He was pierced for our offenses,  
He was crushed for our wrongdoings;  
The punishment for our well-being was laid upon Him,  
And by His wounds we are healed.

## Isaiah 53:6  
All of us, like sheep, have gone astray,  
Each of us has turned to his own way;  
But the Lord has caused the wrongdoing of us all  
To fall on Him.

## Isaiah 53:7  
He was oppressed and afflicted,  
Yet He did not open His mouth;  
Like a lamb that is led to slaughter,  
And like a sheep that is silent before its shearers,  
So He did not open His mouth.

## Isaiah 53:8  
By oppression and judgment He was taken away;  
And as for His generation, who considered  
That He was cut off from the land of the living  
For the wrongdoing of my people, to whom the blow was due?

## Isaiah 53:9  
And His grave was assigned with wicked men,  
Yet He was with a rich man in His death,  
Because He had done no violence,  
Nor was there any deceit in His mouth.

## Isaiah 53:10  
But the Lord desired to crush Him, causing Him grief;  
If He renders Himself as a guilt offering,  
He will see His offspring,  
He will prolong His days,  
And the good pleasure of the Lord will prosper in His hand.

## Isaiah 53:11  
As a result of the anguish of His soul,  
He will see it and be satisfied;  
By His knowledge the Righteous One,  
My Servant, will justify the many,  
For He will bear their wrongdoings.

## Isaiah 53:12  
Therefore, I will allot Him a portion with the great,  
And He will divide the plunder with the strong,  
Because He poured out His life unto death,  
And was counted with wrongdoers;  
Yet He Himself bore the sin of many,  
And interceded for the wrongdoers.
