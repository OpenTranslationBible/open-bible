# Isaiah Chapter 23

## Isaiah 23:1  
The pronouncement concerning Tyre:  
Wail, you ships of Tarshish,  
For Tyre is destroyed, without house or harbor;  
It is reported to them from the land of Cyprus.

## Isaiah 23:2  
Be silent, you inhabitants of the coastland,  
You merchants of Sidon;  
Your messengers crossed the sea

## Isaiah 23:3  
And were on many waters.  
The grain of the Nile, the harvest of the River was her revenue;  
And she was the market of nations.

## Isaiah 23:4  
Be ashamed, Sidon,  
For the sea speaks, the stronghold of the sea, saying,  
“I have neither labored nor given birth,  
I have not brought up young men nor raised virgins.”

## Isaiah 23:5  
When the report reaches Egypt,  
They will be in agony at the report about Tyre.

## Isaiah 23:6  
Cross over to Tarshish;  
Wail, you inhabitants of the coastland.

## Isaiah 23:7  
Is this your jubilant city,  
Whose origin is from antiquity,  
Whose feet used to bring her to colonize distant places?

## Isaiah 23:8  
Who has planned this against Tyre, the bestower of crowns,  
Whose merchants were princes,  
Whose traders were the honored of the earth?

## Isaiah 23:9  
The Lord of armies has planned it,  
To defile the pride of all beauty,  
To disgrace all the honored of the earth.

## Isaiah 23:10  
Overflow your land like the Nile, you daughter of Tarshish,  
There is no more restraint.

## Isaiah 23:11  
He has stretched His hand out over the sea,  
He has made the kingdoms tremble;  
The Lord has given a command concerning Canaan  
To demolish its strongholds.

## Isaiah 23:12  
He has said, “You shall not continue to rejoice, you crushed virgin daughter of Sidon.  
Arise, cross over to Cyprus; even there you will find no rest.”

## Isaiah 23:13  
Behold, the land of the Chaldeans—this is the people which was not.  
Assyria allocated it for desert creatures;  
They erected their siege towers, they stripped its palaces,  
They made it a ruin.

## Isaiah 23:14  
Wail, you ships of Tarshish,  
For your stronghold is destroyed.

## Isaiah 23:15  
Now on that day Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years like the days of one king.  
At the end of seventy years it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the prostitute:

## Isaiah 23:16  
Take your harp, walk around the city, you forgotten prostitute;  
Pluck the strings skillfully, sing many songs,  
So that you may be remembered.

## Isaiah 23:17  
And it will come about at the end of seventy years that the Lord will visit Tyre.  
Then she will return to her prostitute’s wages and commit prostitution with all the kingdoms on the face of the earth.

## Isaiah 23:18  
Her profit and her prostitute’s wages will be set apart to the Lord;  
It will not be stored up or saved,  
But her profit will become sufficient food and choice attire for those who dwell in the presence of the Lord.
