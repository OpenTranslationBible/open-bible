## Isaiah 35:1  
The wilderness and the desert will rejoice, and the desert will shout for joy and blossom; like the crocus

## Isaiah 35:2  
It will blossom profusely and rejoice with joy and jubilation.

They will see the glory of the Lord, the majesty of our God.

## Isaiah 35:3  
Strengthen the exhausted, and make the feeble strong.

## Isaiah 35:4  
Say to those with anxious heart, “Take courage, fear not.  
Behold, your God will come with vengeance; the retribution of God will come, but He will save you.”

## Isaiah 35:5  
Then the eyes of those who are blind will be opened, and the ears of those who are deaf will be unstopped.

For waters will burst forth in the wilderness, and streams in the desert.

The scorched land will become a pool and the thirsty ground springs of water;  
In the haunt of jackals, its resting place, grass becomes reeds and rushes.

A highway will be there, a roadway, and it will be called the Highway of Holiness.  
The unclean will not travel on it, but it will be for the one who walks the way,  
And fools will not wander on it.

No lion will be there, nor will any vicious animal go up on it;  
They will not be found there.  
But the redeemed will walk there,

And the redeemed of the Lord will return and come to Zion with joyful shouting,  
And everlasting joy will be on their heads.  
They will find gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing will flee away.
