# Isaiah Chapter 18

## Isaiah 18:1  
Woe, land of whirring wings  
Which lies beyond the rivers of Cush,

## Isaiah 18:2  
Which sends messengers by the sea,  
Even in papyrus vessels on the surface of the waters.  
Go, swift messengers,  
To a nation tall and smooth,  
To a people feared far and wide,  
A powerful and oppressive nation,  
Whose land the rivers divide.

## Isaiah 18:3  
All you inhabitants of the world and dwellers on earth,  
As soon as a flag is raised on the mountains, you will see it,  
And as soon as the trumpet is blown, you will hear it.

## Isaiah 18:4  
For this is what the Lord has told me:  
“I will quietly look from My dwelling place  
Like dazzling heat in the sunshine,  
Like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.”

## Isaiah 18:5  
For before the harvest, as soon as the bud blossoms  
And the flower becomes a ripening grape,  
He will cut off the shoots with pruning knives  
And remove the spreading branches, He will clear them away.

## Isaiah 18:6  
They will be left together for mountain birds of prey,  
And for the animals of the earth;  
And the birds of prey will spend the summer feeding on them,  
And all the animals of the earth will spend harvest time on them.

## Isaiah 18:7  
At that time a gift of tribute will be brought to the Lord of armies  
From a people tall and smooth,  
From a people feared far and wide,  
A powerful and oppressive nation,  
Whose land the rivers divide—  
To the place of the name of the Lord of armies, to Mount Zion.
