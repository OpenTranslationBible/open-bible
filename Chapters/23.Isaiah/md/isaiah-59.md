# Isaiah Chapter 59

## Isaiah 59:1  
Behold, the Lord’s hand is not so short that it cannot save;  
Nor is His ear so dull that it cannot hear.

## Isaiah 59:2  
But your wrongdoings have caused a separation between you and your God,  
And your sins have hidden His face from you so that He does not hear.

## Isaiah 59:3  
For your hands are defiled with blood,  
And your fingers with wrongdoing;  
Your lips have spoken deceit,  
Your tongue mutters wickedness.

## Isaiah 59:4  
No one sues righteously, and no one pleads honestly.  
They trust in confusion and speak lies;  
They conceive trouble and give birth to disaster.

## Isaiah 59:5  
They hatch vipers’ eggs and weave the spider’s web;  
The one who eats of their eggs dies,  
And from what is crushed, a snake breaks out.

## Isaiah 59:6  
Their webs will not become clothing,  
Nor will they cover themselves with their works;  
Their works are works of wrongdoing,  
And an act of violence is in their hands.

## Isaiah 59:7  
Their feet run to evil,  
And they hurry to shed innocent blood;  
Their thoughts are thoughts of wrongdoing,  
Devastation and destruction are in their paths.

## Isaiah 59:8  
They do not know the way of peace,  
And there is no justice in their tracks;  
They have made their paths crooked,  
Whoever walks on them does not know peace.

## Isaiah 59:9  
Therefore justice is far from us,  
And righteousness does not overtake us;  
We hope for light, but there is darkness,  
For brightness, but we walk in gloom.

## Isaiah 59:10  
We grope for the wall like people who are blind,  
We grope like those who have no eyes.  
We stumble at midday as in the twilight;  
Among those who are healthy, we are like the dead.

## Isaiah 59:11  
All of us growl like bears,  
And moan sadly like doves;  
We hope for justice, but there is none;  
For salvation, but it is far from us.

## Isaiah 59:12  
For our wrongful acts have multiplied before You,  
And our sins have testified against us;  
For our wrongful acts are with us,  
And we know our wrongdoings:

## Isaiah 59:13  
Offending and denying the Lord,  
And turning away from our God,  
Speaking oppression and revolt,  
Conceiving and uttering lying words from the heart.

## Isaiah 59:14  
Justice is turned back,  
And righteousness stands far away;  
For truth has stumbled in the street,  
And uprightness cannot enter.

## Isaiah 59:15  
Truth is lacking,  
And one who turns aside from evil makes himself a prey.  
Now the Lord saw,  
And it was displeasing in His sight that there was no justice.

## Isaiah 59:16  
And He saw that there was no one,  
And was amazed that there was not one to intercede;  
Then His own arm brought salvation to Him,  
And His righteousness upheld Him.

## Isaiah 59:17  
He put on righteousness like a breastplate,  
And a helmet of salvation on His head;  
And He put on garments of vengeance for clothing  
And wrapped Himself with zeal as a cloak.

## Isaiah 59:18  
According to their deeds, so He will repay:  
Wrath to His adversaries, retribution to His enemies;  
To the coastlands He will deal retribution.

## Isaiah 59:19  
So they will fear the name of the Lord from the west,  
And His glory from the rising of the sun;  
For He will come like a rushing stream  
Which the wind of the Lord drives.

## Isaiah 59:20  
“A Redeemer will come to Zion,  
And to those in Jacob who turn from wrongdoing,” declares the Lord.

## Isaiah 59:21  
“As for Me, this is My covenant with them,” says the Lord:  
“My Spirit who is upon you, and My words which I have put in your mouth,  
Shall not depart from your mouth,  
Nor from the mouth of your offspring,  
Nor from the mouth of your offspring’s offspring,” says the Lord,  
“From now and forever.”
