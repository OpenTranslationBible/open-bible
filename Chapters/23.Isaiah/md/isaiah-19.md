# Isaiah Chapter 19

## Isaiah 19:1  
The pronouncement concerning Egypt:  
Behold, the Lord is riding on a swift cloud and is about to come to Egypt;  
The idols of Egypt will tremble at His presence,  
And the heart of the Egyptians will melt within them.

## Isaiah 19:2  
“So I will incite Egyptians against Egyptians;  
And they will fight, each against his brother and each against his neighbour,  
City against city, and kingdom against kingdom.

## Isaiah 19:3  
Then the spirit of the Egyptians will be demoralized within them;  
And I will confuse their strategy,  
So that they will resort to idols and ghosts of the dead,  
And to mediums and spiritists.

## Isaiah 19:4  
I will hand the Egyptians over to a cruel master,  
And a mighty king will rule over them,” declares the Lord God of armies.

The waters from the sea will dry up,

The reeds and rushes will rot away.

## Isaiah 19:7  
The bulrushes by the Nile, by the edge of the Nile  
And all the sown fields by the Nile  
Will become dry, be driven away, and be no more.

And the fishermen will grieve,  
And all those who cast a line into the Nile will mourn,

Moreover, the manufacturers of linen made from combed flax  
And the weavers of white cloth will be utterly dejected.

## Isaiah 19:10  
And the pillars of Egypt will be crushed;  
All the hired labourers will be grieved in soul.

## Isaiah 19:11  
The officials of Zoan are mere fools;  
The advice of Pharaoh’s wisest advisers has become stupid.  
How can you say to Pharaoh,  
“I am a son of the wise, a son of ancient kings”?

## Isaiah 19:12  
Where then are your wise men?  
Please let them tell you,  
And let them understand what the Lord of armies  
Has planned against Egypt.

## Isaiah 19:13  
The officials of Zoan have acted foolishly,  
The officials of Memphis are deluded;  
The leaders of her tribes have led Egypt astray.

## Isaiah 19:14  
The Lord has mixed within her a spirit of confusion;  
They have led Egypt astray in all that it does,  
As a drunken person staggers in his vomit.

## Isaiah 19:15  
There will be no work for Egypt  
Which its head or tail, its palm branch or bulrush, may do.
