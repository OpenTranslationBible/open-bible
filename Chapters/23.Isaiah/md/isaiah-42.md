# Isaiah Chapter 42

## Isaiah 42:1  
Behold, My Servant, whom I uphold;  
My chosen one in whom My soul delights.  
I have put My Spirit upon Him;  
He will bring justice to the nations.

## Isaiah 42:2  
He will not cry out nor raise His voice,  
Nor make His voice heard in the street.

## Isaiah 42:3  
A bent reed He will not break off,  
And a dimly burning wick He will not extinguish;  
He will faithfully bring forth justice.

## Isaiah 42:4  
He will not be disheartened or crushed  
Until He has established justice on the earth;  
And the coastlands will wait for His law.

## Isaiah 42:5  
This is what God the Lord says,  
Who created the heavens and stretched them out,  
Who spread out the earth and its offspring,  
Who gives breath to the people on it  
And spirit to those who walk on it:

## Isaiah 42:6  
“I am the Lord, I have called You in righteousness,  
I will also hold You by the hand and watch over You,  
And I will appoint You as a covenant to the people,  
As a light to the nations,

## Isaiah 42:7  
To open blind eyes,  
To bring out prisoners from the dungeon  
And those who dwell in darkness from the prison.

## Isaiah 42:8  
I am the Lord, that is My name;  
I will not give My glory to another,  
Nor My praise to idols.

## Isaiah 42:9  
Behold, the former things have come to pass,  
Now I declare new things;  
Before they sprout I proclaim them to you.”

## Isaiah 42:10  
Sing to the Lord a new song,  
Sing His praise from the end of the earth!  
You who go down to the sea, and all that is in it,  
You coastlands and those who inhabit them.

## Isaiah 42:11  
Let the wilderness and its cities raise their voices,  
The settlements which Kedar inhabits.  
Let the inhabitants of Sela sing aloud,  
Let them shout for joy from the tops of the mountains.

## Isaiah 42:12  
Let them give glory to the Lord  
And declare His praise in the coastlands.

## Isaiah 42:13  
The Lord will go out like a warrior,  
He will stir His zeal like a man of war.  
He will shout, indeed, He will raise a war cry.  
He will prevail against His enemies.

## Isaiah 42:14  
“I have kept silent for a long time,  
I have kept still and restrained Myself.  
Now like a woman in labor I will groan,  
I will both gasp and pant.

## Isaiah 42:15  
I will lay waste the mountains and hills,  
And wither all their vegetation;  
I will turn the rivers into coastlands  
And dry up the ponds.

## Isaiah 42:16  
I will lead those who are blind by a way they do not know,  
In paths they do not know I will guide them.  
I will turn darkness into light before them  
And uneven land into plains.  
These are the things I will do,  
And I will not leave them undone.”

## Isaiah 42:17  
They will be turned back and be utterly put to shame,  
Who trust in idols,  
Who say to cast metal images, “You are our gods.”

## Isaiah 42:18  
Hear, you who are deaf!  
And look, you who are blind, so that you may see.

## Isaiah 42:19  
Who is blind but My servant,  
Or so deaf as My messenger whom I send?  
Who is so blind as one who is at peace with Me,  
Or so blind as the servant of the Lord?

## Isaiah 42:20  
You have seen many things, but you do not retain them;  
Your ears are open, but no one hears.

## Isaiah 42:21  
The Lord was pleased, for the sake of His righteousness,  
To make the Law great and glorious.

## Isaiah 42:22  
But this is a people plundered and pillaged;  
All of them are trapped in caves,  
Or are hidden away in prisons.  
They have become plunder, with no one to rescue them,  
And spoils, with no one to say, “Give them back!”

## Isaiah 42:23  
Who among you will listen to this?  
Who will pay attention and listen in the time to come?

## Isaiah 42:24  
Who gave Jacob up for spoils, and Israel to plunderers?  
Was it not the Lord, against whom we have sinned,  
And in whose ways they were not willing to walk,  
And whose Law they did not obey?

## Isaiah 42:25  
So He poured out on him the heat of His anger  
And the fierceness of battle;  
And it set him aflame all around,  
Yet he did not recognize it;  
And it burned him, but he paid no attention.
