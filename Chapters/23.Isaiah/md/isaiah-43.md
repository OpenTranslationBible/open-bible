# Isaiah Chapter 43

## Isaiah 43:1  
But now, this is what the Lord says, He who is your Creator, Jacob,  
And He who formed you, Israel:  
“Do not fear, for I have redeemed you;  
I have called you by name; you are Mine!

## Isaiah 43:2  
When you pass through the waters, I will be with you;  
And through the rivers, they will not overflow you.  
When you walk through the fire, you will not be scorched,  
Nor will the flame burn you.

## Isaiah 43:3  
For I am the Lord your God,  
The Holy One of Israel, your Savior;  
I have given Egypt as your ransom,  
Cush and Seba in exchange for you.

## Isaiah 43:4  
Since you are precious in My sight,  
Since you are honored and I love you,  
I will give other people in your place  
And other nations in exchange for your life.

## Isaiah 43:5  
Do not fear, for I am with you;  
I will bring your offspring from the east,  
And gather you from the west.

## Isaiah 43:6  
I will say to the north, ‘Give them up!’  
And to the south, ‘Do not hold them back.’  
Bring My sons from far away  
And My daughters from the ends of the earth,

## Isaiah 43:7  
Everyone who is called by My name,  
And whom I have created for My glory,  
Whom I have formed, even whom I have made.”

## Isaiah 43:8  
Bring out the people who are blind, even though they have eyes,  
And those who are deaf, even though they have ears.

## Isaiah 43:9  
All the nations have gathered together  
So that the peoples may be assembled.  
Who among them can declare this  
And proclaim to us the former things?  
Let them present their witnesses so that they may be justified,  
Or let them hear and say, “It is true.”

## Isaiah 43:10  
“You are My witnesses,” declares the Lord,  
“And My servant whom I have chosen,  
So that you may know and believe Me  
And understand that I am He.  
Before Me there was no God formed,  
And there will be none after Me.

## Isaiah 43:11  
I, only I, am the Lord,  
And there is no savior besides Me.

## Isaiah 43:12  
It is I who have declared and saved and proclaimed,  
And there was no strange god among you;  
So you are My witnesses,” declares the Lord,  
“And I am God.

## Isaiah 43:13  
Even from eternity I am He,  
And there is no one who can rescue from My hand;  
I act, and who can reverse it?”

## Isaiah 43:14  
This is what the Lord your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel says:  
“For your sake I have sent to Babylon,  
And will bring them all down as fugitives,  
Even the Chaldeans, into the ships over which they rejoice.

## Isaiah 43:15  
I am the Lord, your Holy One,  
The Creator of Israel, your King.”

## Isaiah 43:16  
This is what the Lord says,  
He who makes a way through the sea  
And a path through the mighty waters,

## Isaiah 43:17  
Who brings out the chariot and the horse,  
The army and the mighty man  
(They will lie down together and not rise again;  
They have been extinguished and have gone out like a wick):

## Isaiah 43:18  
“Do not call to mind the former things,  
Or consider things of the past.

## Isaiah 43:19  
Behold, I am going to do something new,  
Now it will spring up; will you not be aware of it?  
I will even make a roadway in the wilderness,  
Rivers in the desert.

## Isaiah 43:20  
The animals of the field will glorify Me,  
The jackals and the ostriches,  
Because I have given waters in the wilderness  
And rivers in the desert,  
To give drink to My chosen people.

## Isaiah 43:21  
The people whom I formed for Myself  
Will declare My praise.

## Isaiah 43:22  
Yet you have not called on Me, Jacob;  
But you have become weary of Me, Israel.

## Isaiah 43:23  
You have not brought Me the sheep of your burnt offerings,  
Nor have you honored Me with your sacrifices.  
I have not burdened you with offerings,  
Nor wearied you with incense.

## Isaiah 43:24  
You have not bought Me sweet cane with money,  
Nor have you satisfied Me with the fat of your sacrifices.  
Rather, you have burdened Me with your sins,  
You have wearied Me with your wrongdoings.

## Isaiah 43:25  
I, I alone, am the one who wipes out your wrongdoings for My own sake,  
And I will not remember your sins.

## Isaiah 43:26  
Meet Me in court, let’s argue our case together;  
State your cause, so that you may be proved right.

## Isaiah 43:27  
Your first forefather sinned,  
And your spokesmen have rebelled against Me.

## Isaiah 43:28  
So I will profane the officials of the sanctuary,  
And I will turn Jacob over to destruction and Israel to abuse.
