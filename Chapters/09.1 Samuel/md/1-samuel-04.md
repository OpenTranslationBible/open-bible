# 1 Samuel Chapter 4

## 1 Samuel 4:1

And the word of Samuel was spread throughout all Israel.

---

Now the Israelites went out to fight against the Philistines. They camped at Ebenezer, and the Philistines set up camp at Aphek.

## 1 Samuel 4:2

The Philistines deployed their forces to meet Israel, and as the battle spread, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand men on the battlefield.

## 1 Samuel 4:3

When the soldiers returned to the camp, the elders of Israel said, “Why did the Lord allow us to be defeated today by the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord from Shiloh, so that He may go with us and save us from our enemies.”

## 1 Samuel 4:4

So the people sent men to Shiloh, and they brought back the ark of the covenant of the Lord of hosts, who is enthroned between the cherubim. And Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.

## 1 Samuel 4:5

When the ark of the covenant of the Lord came into the camp, all Israel raised such a great shout that the ground shook.

## 1 Samuel 4:6

The Philistines heard the noise of the shout and asked, “What’s this loud shouting in the Hebrew camp?”  
When they learned that the ark of the Lord had come into the camp,

## 1 Samuel 4:7

The Philistines were afraid. “A god has entered their camp,” they said. “Woe to us! Nothing like this has happened before.

## 1 Samuel 4:8

Woe to us! Who can deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness.

## 1 Samuel 4:9

Take courage and be men, O Philistines, or you will become slaves to the Hebrews, just as they were to you. Be men, and fight!”

## 1 Samuel 4:10

So the Philistines fought, and Israel was defeated. Every man fled to his tent. The slaughter was very great—thirty thousand foot soldiers of Israel fell.

## 1 Samuel 4:11

The ark of God was captured, and Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, died.

## 1 Samuel 4:12

A man from the tribe of Benjamin ran from the battle line and came to Shiloh that same day, with his clothes torn and dust on his head.

## 1 Samuel 4:13

When he arrived, Eli was sitting on his seat by the side of the road, watching, for his heart trembled for the ark of God.  
When the man entered the town and reported what had happened, the whole city cried out.

## 1 Samuel 4:14

Eli heard the outcry and asked, “What is the meaning of this commotion?”  
The man hurried over to tell Eli.

## 1 Samuel 4:15

Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes were so weak that he could not see.

## 1 Samuel 4:16

The man said to Eli, “I have come from the battle line—I fled from it today.”  
Eli asked, “What happened, my son?”

## 1 Samuel 4:17

The messenger replied, “Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has been a great slaughter among the people. Your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured.”

## 1 Samuel 4:18

When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell backward off his seat by the gate. His neck was broken and he died, for he was old and heavy. He had judged Israel for forty years.

## 1 Samuel 4:19

Now Eli’s daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant and near the time of delivery. When she heard the news that the ark of God had been captured, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she went into labour and gave birth, overcome by her pains.

## 1 Samuel 4:20

As she was dying, the women standing by her said, “Don’t be afraid, you have given birth to a son.” But she did not respond or pay attention.

## 1 Samuel 4:21

She named the boy Ichabod, saying, “The glory has departed from Israel,” because the ark of God had been captured and because of the deaths of her father-in-law and her husband.

## 1 Samuel 4:22

She said, “The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been taken.”
