# 1 Samuel Chapter 29

## 1 Samuel 29:1

Now the Philistines gathered all their armies to Aphek,  
while the Israelites were camped by the spring in Jezreel.

## 1 Samuel 29:2

And the governors of the Philistines were proceeding on by hundreds and by thousands,  
and David and his men were proceeding in the rear with Achish.

## 1 Samuel 29:3

Then the commanders of the Philistines said,  
“What are these Hebrews doing here?”  
And Achish said to the commanders of the Philistines,  
“Is this not David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel,  
who has been with me now for days and years,  
and I have found no fault in him since the day he deserted to me to this day?”

## 1 Samuel 29:4

But the commanders of the Philistines were angry with him,  
and the commanders of the Philistines said to him,  
“Make the man go back, so that he may return to his place where you have assigned him,  
and do not let him go down to battle with us,  
so that he does not become an adversary to us during the battle.  
For with what should this man make himself acceptable to his lord?  
Would it not be with the heads of these men?

## 1 Samuel 29:5

Is this not David, of whom they sing in the dances, saying,

> ‘Saul has slain his thousands,  
> And David his tens of thousands’?”

## 1 Samuel 29:6

Then Achish called David and said to him,  
“As the Lord lives, you have been honest,  
and going out and coming in with me in the army is good in my sight,  
for I have not found evil in you from the day of your coming to me to this day.  
Nevertheless, you are not pleasing in the sight of the governors.

## 1 Samuel 29:7

So now return and go in peace, so that you do not displease the governors of the Philistines.”

## 1 Samuel 29:8

But David said to Achish,  
“But what have I done? And what have you found in your servant from the day when I came before you to this day,  
that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?”

## 1 Samuel 29:9

But Achish replied to David,  
“I know that you are pleasing in my sight like an angel of God;  
nevertheless, the commanders of the Philistines have said,  
‘He must not go up with us to the battle.’

## 1 Samuel 29:10

Now then, rise early in the morning with the servants of your lord who have come with you;  
and when you have arisen early in the morning and it becomes light, leave.”

## 1 Samuel 29:11

So David got up early, he and his men, to leave in the morning to return to the land of the Philistines.  
And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
