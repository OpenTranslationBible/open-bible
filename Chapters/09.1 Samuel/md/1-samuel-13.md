# 1 Samuel Chapter 13

## 1 Samuel 13:1

Saul was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned over Israel for forty-two years.

## 1 Samuel 13:2

Saul chose for himself three thousand men of Israel. Two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in the hill country of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. The rest of the people he sent away, each to his tent.

## 1 Samuel 13:3

Jonathan struck the garrison of the Philistines that was at Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, “Let the Hebrews hear!”

## 1 Samuel 13:4

And all Israel heard it said that Saul had struck the Philistine garrison, and that Israel had become a stench to the Philistines. So the people were summoned to Saul at Gilgal.

## 1 Samuel 13:5

The Philistines assembled to fight with Israel—thirty thousand chariots, six thousand horsemen, and troops as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They came up and camped at Michmash, east of Beth-aven.

## 1 Samuel 13:6

When the men of Israel saw that they were in danger—for the people were hard pressed—they hid in caves, in thickets, among rocks, in cellars, and in pits.

## 1 Samuel 13:7

Some of the Hebrews crossed the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. But Saul remained in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.

## 1 Samuel 13:8

He waited seven days, according to the appointed time set by Samuel. But Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the people were scattering from him.

## 1 Samuel 13:9

So Saul said, “Bring to me the burnt offering and the peace offerings.” And he offered the burnt offering.

## 1 Samuel 13:10

As soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came. Saul went out to meet him and greet him.

## 1 Samuel 13:11

But Samuel said, “What have you done?”  
And Saul replied, “When I saw that the people were scattering from me, and that you did not come within the appointed days, and that the Philistines were assembling at Michmash,

## 1 Samuel 13:12

I said, ‘Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the favour of the Lord.’ So I forced myself and offered the burnt offering.”

## 1 Samuel 13:13

Then Samuel said to Saul, “You have acted foolishly. You have not kept the commandment of the Lord your God, which He commanded you. For now the Lord would have established your kingdom over Israel forever.

## 1 Samuel 13:14

But now your kingdom shall not endure. The Lord has sought for Himself a man after His own heart, and the Lord has appointed him as ruler over His people, because you have not kept what the Lord commanded you.”

## 1 Samuel 13:15

Then Samuel arose and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul counted the people who were present with him, about six hundred men.

## 1 Samuel 13:16

Now Saul and his son Jonathan and the people who were with them were staying in Gibeah of Benjamin, while the Philistines camped at Michmash.

## 1 Samuel 13:17

And raiders came out from the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned toward Ophrah, to the land of Shual;

## 1 Samuel 13:18

another company turned toward Beth-horon; and another company turned toward the border overlooking the valley of Zeboim, toward the wilderness.

## 1 Samuel 13:19

Now no blacksmith could be found in all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, “Otherwise the Hebrews will make swords or spears.”

## 1 Samuel 13:20

So all Israel went down to the Philistines, each to sharpen his ploughshare, his mattock, his axe, or his hoe.

## 1 Samuel 13:21

The charge was two-thirds of a shekel for the sharpening of ploughshares, mattocks, pitchforks, and axes, and for setting the goads.

## 1 Samuel 13:22

So on the day of the battle, neither sword nor spear was found in the hand of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonathan, but they were found only with Saul and with Jonathan his son.

## 1 Samuel 13:23

And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.
