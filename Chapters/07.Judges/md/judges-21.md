# Judges Chapter 21

## Judges 21:1

The men of Israel had taken an oath at Mizpah:  
“None of us will give his daughter in marriage to a Benjamite.”

## Judges 21:2

The people went to Bethel and sat before God until evening, raising their voices and weeping bitterly.

## Judges 21:3

“Lord, God of Israel,” they cried,  
“why has this happened to Israel? Why should one tribe be missing from Israel today?”

---

## Judges 21:4

Early the next day the people built an altar and presented burnt offerings and fellowship offerings.

## Judges 21:5

Then the Israelites asked,  
“Who from all the tribes of Israel failed to come before the Lord at Mizpah?”  
(They had taken a solemn oath that anyone who failed to assemble before the Lord at Mizpah was to be put to death.)

## Judges 21:6

Now the Israelites grieved for their fellow Israelites, the Benjamites.  
They said, “Today one tribe is cut off from Israel.

## Judges 21:7

How can we provide wives for those who are left,  
since we have taken an oath by the Lord not to give them any of our daughters in marriage?”

---

## Judges 21:8

Then they asked, “Which one of the tribes of Israel failed to come to the assembly before the Lord at Mizpah?”  
They discovered that no one from Jabesh Gilead had come to the camp.

## Judges 21:9

For when they counted the people, they found that none from Jabesh Gilead was there.

## Judges 21:10

So the assembly sent twelve thousand fighting men to Jabesh Gilead with instructions:  
“Go and put to the sword those living there — the men and women who have slept with a man.”

## Judges 21:11

They found among the people of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young women who had never slept with a man,  
and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh in Canaan.

---

## Judges 21:12

They found among the people of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young women who had never slept with a man,  
and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh in the land of Canaan.

## Judges 21:13

Then the whole assembly sent an offer of peace to the Benjamites at the rock of Rimmon.

## Judges 21:14

So the Benjamites returned at that time,  
and the Israelites gave them the women of Jabesh Gilead who had been spared.  
But there were not enough for all of them.

---

## Judges 21:15

The people grieved for Benjamin,  
because the Lord had made a gap in the tribes of Israel.

## Judges 21:16

And the elders of the assembly said,  
“With the women of Benjamin destroyed, how shall we provide wives for the men who are left?

## Judges 21:17

The Benjamite survivors must have heirs,” they said,  
“so that a tribe of Israel will not be wiped out.

## Judges 21:18

We can’t give them our daughters as wives, since we Israelites have taken this oath:  
‘Cursed be anyone who gives a wife to a Benjamite.’”

---

## Judges 21:19

But look, there is the annual festival of the Lord in Shiloh,  
which lies north of Bethel, east of the road that goes from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah.”

## Judges 21:20

So they instructed the Benjamites, saying,  
“Go and hide in the vineyards

## Judges 21:21

and watch.  
When the young women of Shiloh come out to join in the dancing,  
rush from the vineyards and each of you seize one of them to be your wife.  
Then return to the land of Benjamin.”

## Judges 21:22

When their fathers or brothers complain to us, we will say to them,  
“Do us the favour of letting them keep them,  
because we did not get wives for them during the war,  
and you will not be guilty of breaking your oath, since you did not give your daughters to them.”

---

## Judges 21:23

So that is what the Benjamites did.  
While the young women were dancing, each man caught one and carried her off to be his wife.  
Then they returned to their inheritance, rebuilt their towns and settled in them.

## Judges 21:24

At that time the Israelites left that place and went home to their tribes and clans,  
each to his own inheritance.

---

## Judges 21:25

In those days Israel had no king;  
everyone did what was right in his own eyes.
