# Judges Chapter 18

## Judges 18:1

In those days Israel had no king.  
And in those days the tribe of the Danites was seeking a place of their own to settle,  
because they had not yet come into an inheritance among the tribes of Israel.

## Judges 18:2

So the Danites sent five of their leading men from Zorah and Eshtaol to spy out the land and explore it.  
These men represented all their clans. They told them, “Go, explore the land.”  
So they entered the hill country of Ephraim and came to the house of Micah, where they spent the night.

## Judges 18:3

When they were near Micah’s house, they recognised the voice of the young Levite.  
So they turned in and asked him, “Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? Why are you here?”

## Judges 18:4

He told them what Micah had done for him, and said, “He has hired me, and I am his priest.”

## Judges 18:5

Then they said to him, “Please inquire of God to learn whether our journey will be successful.”

## Judges 18:6

The priest answered them, “Go in peace. Your journey has the Lord’s approval.”

## Judges 18:7

So the five men left and came to Laish, where they saw that the people were living in safety,  
like the Sidonians — peaceful and secure.  
There was no ruler oppressing them, and they lived far from the Sidonians and had no relationship with anyone else.

## Judges 18:8

When they returned to Zorah and Eshtaol, their fellow Danites asked, “What did you find?”

## Judges 18:9

They answered, “Come on, let’s attack them! We have seen the land, and it is very good.  
Aren’t you going to do something? Don’t hesitate to go there and take it over.

## Judges 18:10

When you get there, you will find an unsuspecting people and a spacious land that God has put into your hands —  
a land that lacks nothing whatever.”

## Judges 18:11

Then six hundred men of the Danite clan, armed for battle, set out from Zorah and Eshtaol.

## Judges 18:12

On their way they camped near Kiriath Jearim in Judah.  
This is why the place west of Kiriath Jearim is called Mahaneh Dan to this day.

## Judges 18:13

From there they went on to the hill country of Ephraim and came to Micah’s house.

## Judges 18:14

Then the five men who had spied out the land of Laish said to their fellow Danites,  
“Do you know that one of these houses has an ephod, some household gods and an image overlaid with silver?  
Now you know what to do.”

## Judges 18:15

So they turned in there and went to the house of the young Levite at Micah’s place and greeted him.

## Judges 18:16

The six hundred Danites, armed for battle, stood at the entrance of the gate.

## Judges 18:17

The five men who had spied out the land went inside and took the carved image, the ephod, the household gods and the overlaid image,  
while the priest stood at the entrance with the six hundred armed men.

## Judges 18:18

When the men went into Micah’s house and took the carved image, the ephod, the household gods and the metal idol,  
the priest said to them, “What are you doing?”

## Judges 18:19

They answered him, “Be quiet! Don’t say a word. Come with us and be our father and priest.  
Isn’t it better that you serve a tribe and clan in Israel as priest rather than just one man’s household?”

## Judges 18:20

The priest was very pleased. He took the ephod, the household gods and the image, and went along with the people.

## Judges 18:21

Putting their little children, their livestock, and their possessions in front of them, they turned and left.

## Judges 18:22

When they had gone some distance from Micah’s house,  
the men who lived near Micah were called together and overtook the Danites.

## Judges 18:23

As they shouted after them, the Danites turned and said to Micah,  
“What’s the matter with you that you called out your men to fight?”

## Judges 18:24

He replied, “You took the gods I made, and my priest, and went away. What else do I have?  
How can you ask, ‘What’s the matter with you?’”

## Judges 18:25

The Danites answered, “Don’t argue with us, or some of the men may get angry and attack you,  
and you and your family will lose your lives.”

## Judges 18:26

So the Danites went on their way, and Micah, seeing that they were too strong for him, turned around and went back home.

---

## Judges 18:27

Then they took what Micah had made, and his priest, and went on to Laish,  
a quiet and unsuspecting people.  
They attacked them with the sword and burned down their city.

## Judges 18:28

There was no one to rescue them, because they lived far from Sidon and had no alliance with anyone else.  
The city was in the valley near Beth Rehob.  
The Danites rebuilt the city and settled there.

## Judges 18:29

They named it Dan after their ancestor Dan, who was born to Israel —  
though the city used to be called Laish.

## Judges 18:30

There the Danites set up for themselves the carved image,  
and Jonathan son of Gershom, the son of Moses, and his sons were priests for the tribe of Dan  
until the time of the captivity of the land.

## Judges 18:31

They continued to use the carved image Micah had made,  
all the time the house of God was in Shiloh.
