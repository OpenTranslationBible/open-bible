# Judges Chapter 13

## Judges 13:1

Again the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the Lord,  
so the Lord delivered them into the hands of the Philistines for forty years.

## Judges 13:2

A certain man of Zorah, named Manoah, from the tribe of Dan, had a wife who was childless, unable to give birth.

## Judges 13:3

The angel of the Lord appeared to her and said,  
“You are barren and childless, but you are going to become pregnant and give birth to a son.

## Judges 13:4

Now see to it that you drink no wine or other fermented drink and that you do not eat anything unclean.

## Judges 13:5

You will become pregnant and have a son whose head is never to be touched by a razor,  
because the boy is to be a Nazirite, dedicated to God from the womb.  
He will take the lead in delivering Israel from the hands of the Philistines.”

## Judges 13:6

Then the woman went to her husband and told him,  
“A man of God came to me. He looked like an angel of God, very awesome.  
I didn’t ask him where he came from, and he didn’t tell me his name.

## Judges 13:7

But he said to me, ‘You will become pregnant and have a son.  
Now then, do not drink wine or other fermented drink and do not eat anything unclean,  
because the boy will be a Nazirite of God from the womb until the day of his death.’”

## Judges 13:8

Then Manoah prayed to the Lord:  
“Pardon Your servant, Lord. I beg You to let the man of God You sent to us come again  
to teach us how to bring up the boy who is to be born.”

## Judges 13:9

God heard Manoah, and the angel of God came again to the woman while she was out in the field;  
but her husband Manoah was not with her.

## Judges 13:10

The woman hurried to tell her husband,  
“He’s here! The man who appeared to me the other day has come back!”

## Judges 13:11

Manoah got up and followed his wife.  
When he came to the man, he said,  
“Are you the one who talked to my wife?”  
“I am,” he said.

---

## Judges 13:12

So Manoah asked him, “When your words are fulfilled, what is to be the rule that governs the boy’s life and work?”

## Judges 13:13

The angel of the Lord answered,  
“Your wife must do all that I have told her.

## Judges 13:14

She must not eat anything that comes from the vine,  
nor drink wine or any other fermented drink,  
nor eat anything unclean.  
She must do everything I have commanded her.”

---

## Judges 13:15

Manoah said to the angel of the Lord,  
“We would like you to stay until we prepare a young goat for you.”

## Judges 13:16

The angel of the Lord replied,  
“Even though you detain me, I will not eat any of your food.  
But if you prepare a burnt offering, offer it to the Lord.”  
(Manoah did not realise that it was the angel of the Lord.)

## Judges 13:17

Then Manoah inquired of the angel of the Lord,  
“What is your name, so that we may honour you when your word comes true?”

## Judges 13:18

He replied,  
“Why do you ask my name? It is beyond understanding.”

---

## Judges 13:19

Then Manoah took a young goat, together with the grain offering,  
and sacrificed it on a rock to the Lord.  
And the Lord did an amazing thing while Manoah and his wife watched:

## Judges 13:20

As the flame blazed up from the altar toward heaven,  
the angel of the Lord ascended in the flame.  
Seeing this, Manoah and his wife fell with their faces to the ground.

## Judges 13:21

When the angel of the Lord did not show himself again to Manoah and his wife,  
Manoah realised that it was the angel of the Lord.

## Judges 13:22

“We are doomed to die!” he said to his wife. “We have seen God!”

## Judges 13:23

But his wife answered,  
“If the Lord had meant to kill us, He would not have accepted a burnt offering and grain offering from our hands, nor shown us all these things or told us this now.”

---

## Judges 13:24

The woman bore a son and named him Samson.  
As the boy grew, the Lord’s favour was upon him.

## Judges 13:25

And the Spirit of the Lord began to stir him  
while he was in Mahaneh Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.
