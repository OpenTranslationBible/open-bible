# 2 Timothy Chapter 2

## 2 Timothy 2:1

You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.

## 2 Timothy 2:2

The things which you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, entrust these to faithful people who will be able to teach others also.

## 2 Timothy 2:3

Suffer hardship with me, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.

## 2 Timothy 2:4

No soldier in active service entangles himself in the affairs of everyday life, so that he may please the one who enlisted him.

## 2 Timothy 2:5

And if someone likewise competes as an athlete, he is not crowned as victor unless he competes according to the rules.

## 2 Timothy 2:6

The hardworking farmer ought to be the first to receive his share of the crops.

## 2 Timothy 2:7

Consider what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything.

## 2 Timothy 2:8

Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, descendant of David, according to my gospel,

## 2 Timothy 2:9

for which I suffer hardship even to imprisonment as a criminal; but the word of God is not imprisoned.

## 2 Timothy 2:10

For this reason I endure all things for the sake of those who are chosen, so that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus and with it eternal glory.

## 2 Timothy 2:11

The statement is trustworthy:

> For if we died with Him,
> we will also live with Him;

## 2 Timothy 2:12

> If we endure,
> we will also reign with Him;  
> If we deny Him,
> He also will deny us;

## 2 Timothy 2:13

> If we are faithless,
> He remains faithful,
> for He cannot deny Himself.

## 2 Timothy 2:14

Remind them of these things, and solemnly exhort them in the presence of God not to dispute about words, which is useless and leads to the ruin of the listeners.

## 2 Timothy 2:15

Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a worker who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth.

## 2 Timothy 2:16

But avoid worldly and empty chatter, for it will lead to further ungodliness,

## 2 Timothy 2:17

and their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,

## 2 Timothy 2:18

who have gone astray from the truth, claiming that the resurrection has already taken place, and they are jeopardising the faith of some.

## 2 Timothy 2:19

Nevertheless, the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal: “The Lord knows those who are His;” and, “Everyone who names the name of the Lord is to keep away from wickedness.”

## 2 Timothy 2:20

Now in a large house there are not only gold and silver implements, but also implements of wood and earthenware, and some are for honour, while others are for dishonour.

## 2 Timothy 2:21

Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from these things, he will be an implement for honour, sanctified, useful to the Master, prepared for every good work.

## 2 Timothy 2:22

Now flee from youthful lusts and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.

## 2 Timothy 2:23

But refuse foolish and ignorant speculations, knowing that they produce quarrels.

## 2 Timothy 2:24

The Lord’s bond-servant must not be quarrelsome, but be kind to all, skilful in teaching, patient when wronged,

## 2 Timothy 2:25

with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition, if perhaps God may grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth,

## 2 Timothy 2:26

and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, having been held captive by him to do his will.
