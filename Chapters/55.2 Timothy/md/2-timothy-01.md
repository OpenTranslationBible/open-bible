# 2 Timothy Chapter 1

## 2 Timothy 1:1

Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise of life in Christ Jesus,

## 2 Timothy 1:2

To Timothy, my beloved son:  
Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

## 2 Timothy 1:3

I thank God, whom I serve with a clear conscience the way my forefathers did, as I constantly remember you in my prayers night and day,

## 2 Timothy 1:4

longing to see you, even as I recall your tears, so that I may be filled with joy.

## 2 Timothy 1:5

For I am mindful of the sincere faith within you, which first dwelled in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am sure is in you as well.

## 2 Timothy 1:6

For this reason I remind you to kindle afresh the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.

## 2 Timothy 1:7

For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power and love and discipline.

## 2 Timothy 1:8

Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, or of me His prisoner; but join with me in suffering for the gospel according to the power of God,

## 2 Timothy 1:9

who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace, which was granted to us in Christ Jesus from all eternity,

## 2 Timothy 1:10

but now has been revealed by the appearing of our Saviour Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel,

## 2 Timothy 1:11

for which I was appointed a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher.

## 2 Timothy 1:12

For this reason I also suffer these things, but I am not ashamed; for I know whom I have believed, and I am convinced that He is able to protect what I have entrusted to Him until that day.

## 2 Timothy 1:13

Hold on to the example of sound words which you have heard from me, in the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.

## 2 Timothy 1:14

Protect, through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us, the treasure which has been entrusted to you.

## 2 Timothy 1:15

You are aware of the fact that all who are in Asia turned away from me, among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.

## 2 Timothy 1:16

The Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains;

## 2 Timothy 1:17

but when he was in Rome, he eagerly searched for me and found me—

## 2 Timothy 1:18

the Lord grant to him to find mercy from the Lord on that day—and you know very well what services he rendered at Ephesus.
