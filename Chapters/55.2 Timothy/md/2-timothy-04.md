# 2 Timothy Chapter 4

## 2 Timothy 4:1

I solemnly exhort you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom:

## 2 Timothy 4:2

Preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; correct, rebuke, and exhort, with great patience and instruction.

## 2 Timothy 4:3

For the time will come when they will not tolerate sound doctrine; but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance with their own desires,

## 2 Timothy 4:4

and they will turn their ears away from the truth and will turn aside to myths.

## 2 Timothy 4:5

But as for you, use self-restraint in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.

## 2 Timothy 4:6

For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure has come.

## 2 Timothy 4:7

I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith;

## 2 Timothy 4:8

in the future there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day; and not only to me, but also to all who have loved His appearing.

## 2 Timothy 4:9

Make every effort to come to me soon;

## 2 Timothy 4:10

for Demas, having loved this present world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica; Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.

## 2 Timothy 4:11

Only Luke is with me. Take along Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service.

## 2 Timothy 4:12

But I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.

## 2 Timothy 4:13

When you come, bring the cloak which I left at Troas with Carpus, and the books, especially the parchments.

## 2 Timothy 4:14

Alexander the coppersmith did me great harm; the Lord will repay him according to his deeds.

## 2 Timothy 4:15

Be on guard against him yourself too, for he vigorously opposed our teaching.

## 2 Timothy 4:16

At my first defense no one supported me, but all deserted me; may it not be counted against them.

## 2 Timothy 4:17

But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me, so that through me the proclamation might be fully accomplished, and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was rescued out of the lionâ€™s mouth.

## 2 Timothy 4:18

The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed, and will bring me safely to His heavenly kingdom; to Him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.

## 2 Timothy 4:19

Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.

## 2 Timothy 4:20

Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus sick at Miletus.

## 2 Timothy 4:21

Make every effort to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, also Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers and sisters.

## 2 Timothy 4:22

The Lord be with your spirit.  
Grace be with you.
