# 2 Timothy Chapter 3

## 2 Timothy 3:1

But realise this, that in the last days difficult times will come.

## 2 Timothy 3:2

For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, slanderers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy,

## 2 Timothy 3:3

unloving, irreconcilable, malicious gossips, without self-control, brutal, haters of good,

## 2 Timothy 3:4

treacherous, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,

## 2 Timothy 3:5

holding to a form of godliness although they have denied its power; avoid such people as these.

## 2 Timothy 3:6

For among them are those who slip into households and captivate weak women weighed down with sins, led on by various impulses,

## 2 Timothy 3:7

always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.

## 2 Timothy 3:8

Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth, men of depraved mind, worthless in regard to the faith.

## 2 Timothy 3:9

But they will not make further progress, for their foolishness will be obvious to all, just as that of Jannes and Jambres also was.

## 2 Timothy 3:10

Now you followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, perseverance,

## 2 Timothy 3:11

persecutions, and sufferings, such as happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystraâ€”what persecutions I endured, and out of them all the Lord rescued me!

## 2 Timothy 3:12

Indeed, all who want to live in a godly way in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.

## 2 Timothy 3:13

But evil people and impostors will proceed from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.

## 2 Timothy 3:14

You, however, continue in the things you have learned and become convinced of, knowing from whom you have learned them,

## 2 Timothy 3:15

and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.

## 2 Timothy 3:16

All Scripture is inspired by God and beneficial for teaching, for rebuke, for correction, for training in righteousness;

## 2 Timothy 3:17

so that the man of God may be fully capable, equipped for every good work.
