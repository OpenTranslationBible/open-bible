# Job Chapter 27

## Job 27:1

Then Job again took up his discourse and said,

## Job 27:2

> “As God lives, who has taken away my right,  
> And the Almighty, who has embittered my soul,

## Job 27:3

> For as long as life is in me,  
> And the breath of God is in my nostrils,

## Job 27:4

> My lips certainly will not speak unjustly,  
> Nor will my tongue mutter deceit.

## Job 27:5

> Far be it from me that I should declare you right;  
> Until I die, I will not give up my integrity.

## Job 27:6

> I have kept hold of my righteousness and will not let it go.  
> My heart does not rebuke any of my days.

---

## Job 27:7

> May my enemy be as the wicked,  
> And my opponent as the unjust.

## Job 27:8

> For what is the hope of the godless when he makes an end of life,  
> When God requires his life?

## Job 27:9

> Will God hear his cry  
> When distress comes upon him?

## Job 27:10

> Will he take delight in the Almighty?  
> Will he call on God at all times?

---

## Job 27:11

> I will instruct you in the power of God;  
> What is with the Almighty I will not conceal.

## Job 27:12

> Behold, all of you have seen it;  
> Why then do you talk of empty nonsense?

---

## Job 27:13

> This is the portion of a wicked person from God,  
> And the inheritance which tyrants receive from the Almighty:

## Job 27:14

> Though his sons are many, they are destined for the sword;  
> And his descendants will not be satisfied with bread.

## Job 27:15

> His survivors will be buried because of the plague,  
> And their widows will not be able to weep.

## Job 27:16

> Though he piles up silver like dust,  
> And prepares garments as plentiful as the clay,

## Job 27:17

> He may prepare it, but the righteous will wear it,  
> And the innocent will divide the silver.

## Job 27:18

> He has built his house like the spider’s web,  
> Or a hut which the watchman has made.

## Job 27:19

> He lies down rich, but never again;  
> He opens his eyes, and it no longer exists.

## Job 27:20

> Terrors overtake him like a flood;  
> A storm steals him away in the night.

## Job 27:21

> The east wind carries him away, and he is gone;  
> For it sweeps him away from his place.

## Job 27:22

> For it will hurl at him without mercy;  
> He will certainly try to flee from its power.

## Job 27:23

> People will clap their hands at him,  
> And will whistle at him from their places.
