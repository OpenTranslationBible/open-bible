# Job Chapter 32

## Job 32:1

Then these three men stopped answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.

## Job 32:2

But the anger of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, burned;  
his anger burned against Job because he justified himself before God.

## Job 32:3

And his anger burned against his three friends because they had not found an answer, and yet had condemned Job.

## Job 32:4

Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because they were years older than he.

## Job 32:5

But when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men, his anger burned.

## Job 32:6

So Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite spoke out and said,

> “I am young in years and you are old;  
> Therefore I was shy and afraid to tell you what I think.

## Job 32:7

> I thought age should speak,  
> And increase in years should teach wisdom.

## Job 32:8

> But it is a spirit that is in mankind,  
> And the breath of the Almighty gives them understanding.

## Job 32:9

> The abundant in years may not be wise,  
> Nor may elders understand justice.

## Job 32:10

> So I say, ‘Listen to me,  
> I too will tell what I think.’

## Job 32:11

> Behold, I waited for your words,  
> I listened to your reasonings,  
> While you pondered what to say.

## Job 32:12

> I also paid close attention to you;  
> But behold, there was no one who refuted Job,  
> Not one of you who answered his words.

## Job 32:13

> So do not say, ‘We have found wisdom:  
> God will defeat him, not man.’

## Job 32:14

> But he has not presented his words against me,  
> Nor will I reply to him with your arguments.

## Job 32:15

> They are dismayed, they no longer answer;  
> Words have failed them.

## Job 32:16

> Should I wait, because they are not speaking,  
> Because they stand still and no longer answer?

## Job 32:17

> I too will give my share of answers;  
> I too will tell what I think.

## Job 32:18

> For I am full of words;  
> The spirit within me compels me.

## Job 32:19

> Behold, my belly is like unvented wine,  
> Like new wineskins it is about to burst.

## Job 32:20

> Let me speak so that I may get relief;  
> Let me open my lips and answer.

## Job 32:21

> Let me be partial to no one,  
> Nor flatter any man.

## Job 32:22

> For I do not know how to flatter,  
> Otherwise my Maker would soon take me away.
