> My tongue in my mouth speaks.

## Job 33:3

> My words are from the integrity of my heart,  
> And my lips speak knowledge sincerely.

## Job 33:4

> The Spirit of God has made me,  
> And the breath of the Almighty gives me life.

## Job 33:5

> Line up before me, take your stand.

## Job 33:6

> Behold, I belong to God like you;  
> I too have been formed from the clay.

## Job 33:8

> “Surely you have spoken in my hearing,  
> And I have heard the sound of your words:

## Job 33:9

> ‘I am pure, without wrongdoing;  
> I am innocent and there is no guilt in me.

## Job 33:10

> Behold, He invents pretexts against me;  
> He counts me as His enemy.

## Job 33:11

> He watches all my paths.’

## Job 33:12

> “Behold, let me respond to you, you are not right in this,  
> For God is greater than mankind.

## Job 33:13

> Why do you complain against Him  
> That He does not give an account of all His doings?

## Job 33:14

> Or twice, yet no one notices it.

## Job 33:15

> In a dream, a vision of the night,  
> When deep sleep falls on people,  
> While they slumber in their beds,

## Job 33:16

> Then He opens the ears of people,  
> And horrifies them with warnings,

## Job 33:17

> So that He may turn a person away from wrongdoing,  
> And keep a man from pride;

## Job 33:18

> He keeps his soul back from the pit,  
> And his life from perishing by the spear.

---

## Job 33:19

> A person is also rebuked by pain in his bed,  
> And with constant distress in his bones,

## Job 33:20

> So that his life loathes bread,  
> And his soul, food that he should crave.

## Job 33:21

> His flesh wastes away from sight,  
> And his bones, which were not seen, stick out.

## Job 33:22

> Then his soul comes near to the pit,  
> And his life to those who bring death.

## Job 33:23

> If there is an interceding angel for him,  
> One out of a thousand,  
> To remind a person of what is right for him,

## Job 33:24

> And he is gracious to him, and says,  
> ‘Save him from going down to the pit,  
> I have found a ransom,’

## Job 33:25

> Let his flesh become fresher than in youth,  
> Let him return to the days of his youthful vigour.

## Job 33:26

> Then he will pray to God, and He will accept him,  
> So that he may see His face with joy,  
> And He will restore His righteousness to that person.

## Job 33:27

> He will sing to people and say,  
> ‘I have sinned and perverted what is right,  
> And it was not proper for me.

## Job 33:28

> He has redeemed my soul from going to the pit,  
> And my life will see the light.’

---

## Job 33:29

> “Behold, God does all these things for a man two or three times,

## Job 33:30

> To bring back his soul from the pit,  
> So that he may be enlightened with the light of life.

---

## Job 33:31

> Pay attention, Job, listen to me;  
> Keep silent, and let me speak.

## Job 33:32

> Then if you have anything to say, answer me;  
> Speak, for I desire to justify you.

## Job 33:33

> If not, listen to me;  
> Keep silent, and I will teach you wisdom.”
