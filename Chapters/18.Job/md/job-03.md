# Job Chapter 3

## Job 3:1

Afterward Job opened his mouth  
and cursed the day of his birth.

## Job 3:2

And Job said,

---

## Job 3:3

> “May the day on which I was born perish,  
> And the night which said, ‘A boy is conceived.’

## Job 3:4

> May that day be darkness;  
> May God above not care for it,  
> Nor light shine on it.

## Job 3:5

> May darkness and black gloom claim it;  
> May a cloud settle on it;  
> May the blackness of the day terrify it.

## Job 3:6

> As for that night, may darkness seize it;  
> May it not rejoice among the days of the year;  
> May it not come into the number of the months.

## Job 3:7

> Behold, may that night be barren;  
> May no joyful shout enter it.

## Job 3:8

> May those curse it who curse the day,  
> Who are prepared to rouse Leviathan.

## Job 3:9

> May the stars of its twilight be darkened;  
> May it wait for light but have none,  
> And may it not see the breaking dawn,

## Job 3:10

> Because it did not shut the opening of my mother’s womb,  
> Or hide trouble from my eyes.

---

## Job 3:11

> “Why did I not die at birth,  
> Come out of the womb and pass away?

## Job 3:12

> Why were there knees to receive me,  
> And breasts, that I might nurse?

## Job 3:13

> For now I would have lain down and been quiet;  
> I would have slept then, I would be at rest,

## Job 3:14

> With kings and counsellors of the earth,  
> Who rebuilt ruins for themselves;

## Job 3:15

> Or with rulers who had gold,  
> Who were filling their houses with silver.

## Job 3:16

> Or like a miscarriage that is hidden, I would not exist,  
> As infants that never saw light.

## Job 3:17

> There the wicked cease from raging,  
> And there the weary are at rest.

## Job 3:18

> The prisoners are at ease together;  
> They do not hear the voice of the taskmaster.

## Job 3:19

> The small and the great are there,  
> And the slave is free from his master.

## Job 3:20

> “Why is light given to one burdened with grief,  
> And life to the bitter of soul,

## Job 3:21

> Who long for death, but there is none,  
> And dig for it more than for hidden treasures;

## Job 3:22

> Who rejoice greatly,  
> They are glad when they find the grave?

## Job 3:23

> Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden,  
> And whom God has shut off?

## Job 3:24

> For my groaning comes at the sight of my food,  
> And my cries pour out like water.

## Job 3:25

> For what I fear comes upon me,  
> And what I dread encounters me.

## Job 3:26

> I am not at ease, nor am I quiet,  
> And I am not at rest, but turmoil comes.”
