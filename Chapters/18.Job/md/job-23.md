# Job Chapter 23

## Job 23:1

Then Job responded,

## Job 23:2

> â€œEven today my complaint is rebellion;  
> His hand is heavy despite my groaning.

## Job 23:3

> Oh that I knew how to find Him,  
> That I might come to His home!

## Job 23:4

> I would present my case before Him  
> And fill my mouth with arguments.

## Job 23:5

> I would learn the words which He would answer,  
> And perceive what He would say to me.

## Job 23:6

> Would He contend with me by the greatness of His power?  
> No, He would certainly pay attention to me.

## Job 23:7

> There the upright would argue with Him,  
> And I would be free of my Judge forever.

## Job 23:8

> Behold, I go forward but He is not there,  
> And backward, but I cannot perceive Him;

## Job 23:9

> When He acts on the left, I cannot behold Him;  
> He turns to the right, but I cannot see Him.

## Job 23:10

> But He knows the way I take;  
> When He has put me to the test, I will come out as gold.

## Job 23:11

> My foot has held on to His path;  
> I have kept His way and not turned aside.

## Job 23:12

> I have not failed the command of His lips;  
> I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my necessary food.

## Job 23:13

> But He is unique, and who can make Him turn?  
> Whatever His soul desires, He does it.

## Job 23:14

> For He carries out what is destined for me,  
> And many such destinies are with Him.

## Job 23:15

> Therefore, I would be terrified at His presence;  
> When I consider this, I am afraid of Him.

## Job 23:16

> It is God who has made my heart faint,  
> And the Almighty who has terrified me,

## Job 23:17

> But I am not destroyed by darkness,  
> Nor by thick gloom which covers me.
