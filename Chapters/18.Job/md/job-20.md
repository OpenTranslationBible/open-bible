> And the joy of the godless momentary?

## Job 20:6

> Though his arrogance reaches the heavens,  
> And his head touches the clouds,

## Job 20:7

> He perishes forever like his refuse;  
> Those who have seen him will say, ‘Where is he?’

## Job 20:8

> He flies away like a dream, and they cannot find him;  
> He vanishes like a vision of the night.

## Job 20:9

> And his place no longer beholds him.

## Job 20:10

## Job 20:12

> Though evil tastes sweet in his mouth  
> And he hides it under his tongue,

## Job 20:13

> Though he desires it and will not let it go,  
> But holds it in his mouth,

## Job 20:14

> Yet his food in his stomach is changed  
> To the venom of cobras within him.

## Job 20:15

> He swallows riches,  
> But will vomit them up;  
> God will expel them from his belly.

> He sucks the poison of cobras;  
> A viper’s tongue kills him.

## Job 20:17

> The rivers flowing with honey and curds.

## Job 20:18

> As to the riches of his trading,  
> He cannot even enjoy them.

## Job 20:19

> For he has oppressed and neglected the poor;  
> He has seized a house which he did not build.

## Job 20:20

> Because he knew no quiet within him,  
> He does not retain anything he desires.

## Job 20:21

> Nothing remains for him to devour,  
> Therefore his prosperity does not endure.

## Job 20:22

> In the fullness of his excess he will be cramped;  
> The hand of everyone who suffers will come against him.

> And rains it down on him while he is eating.

## Job 20:24

> He may flee from the iron weapon,  
> But the bronze bow will pierce him.

## Job 20:25

> It is drawn and comes out of his back,  
> Even the flashing point from his liver;  
> Terrors come upon him.

## Job 20:26

> Complete darkness is held in reserve for his treasures,  
> A fire not fanned will consume him;  
> It will consume the survivor in his tent.

## Job 20:27

> The heavens will reveal his guilt,  
> And the earth will rise up against him.

## Job 20:28

> The increase of his house will vanish;  
> His possessions will flow away on the day of His anger.

## Job 20:29

> This is a wicked person’s portion from God,  
> The inheritance decreed to him by God.”
