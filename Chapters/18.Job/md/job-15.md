# Job Chapter 15

## Job 15:1

Then Eliphaz the Temanite responded,

## Job 15:2

> “Should a wise man answer with windy knowledge,  
> And fill himself with the east wind?

## Job 15:3

> Should he argue with useless talk,  
> Or with words which do not benefit?

## Job 15:4

> Indeed, you do away with reverence,  
> And hinder meditation before God.

## Job 15:5

> For your guilt teaches your mouth,  
> And you choose the language of the crafty.

## Job 15:6

> Your own mouth condemns you, and not I;  
> And your own lips testify against you.

## Job 15:7

> Were you the first person to be born,  
> Or were you brought forth before the hills?

## Job 15:8

> Do you hear the secret counsel of God,  
> And limit wisdom to yourself?

## Job 15:9

> What do you know that we do not know?  
> What do you understand that we do not?

## Job 15:10

> Both the gray-haired and the aged are among us,  
> Older than your father.

## Job 15:11

> Are the consolations of God too little for you,  
> Or the word spoken gently with you?

## Job 15:12

> Why does your heart take you away,  
> And why do your eyes wink,

## Job 15:13

> That you turn your spirit against God,  
> And produce such words from your mouth?

## Job 15:14

> What is man, that he would be pure,  
> Or one born of woman, that he would be righteous?

## Job 15:15

> Behold, He puts no trust in His holy ones,  
> And the heavens are not pure in His sight;

## Job 15:16

> How much less one who is detestable and corrupt:  
> A person who drinks injustice like water!

## Job 15:17

> “I will tell you, listen to me;  
> And what I have seen I will also declare;

## Job 15:18

> What wise people have told,  
> And have not concealed from their fathers,

## Job 15:19

> To whom alone the land was given,  
> And no stranger passed among them.

## Job 15:20

> The wicked person writhes in pain all his days,  
> And the number of years is reserved for the ruthless.

## Job 15:21

> Sounds of terror are in his ears;  
> While he is at peace the destroyer comes upon him.

## Job 15:22

> He does not believe that he will return from darkness,  
> And he is destined for the sword.

## Job 15:23

> He wanders about for food, saying, ‘Where is it?’  
> He knows that a day of darkness is at hand.

## Job 15:24

> Distress and anguish terrify him,  
> They overpower him like a king ready for the attack,

## Job 15:25

> Because he has reached out with his hand against God,  
> And is arrogant toward the Almighty.

## Job 15:26

> He rushes headlong at Him with his massive shield.

## Job 15:27

> For he has covered his face with fat,  
> And put fat on his thighs.

## Job 15:28

> He has lived in desolate cities,  
> In houses no one would inhabit,  
> Which are destined to become ruins.

## Job 15:29

> He will not become rich, nor will his wealth endure;  
> Nor will their possessions spread over the land.

## Job 15:30

> He will not escape from darkness;  
> The flame will dry up his shoot,  
> And he will go away by the breath of His mouth.

## Job 15:31

> Let him not trust in emptiness, deceiving himself;  
> For emptiness will be his reward.

## Job 15:32

> It will be fulfilled before his time,  
> And his palm branch will not be green.

## Job 15:33

> He will drop off his unripe grape like the vine,  
> And will cast off his flower like the olive tree.

## Job 15:34

> For the company of the godless is barren,  
> And fire consumes the tents of the corrupt.

## Job 15:35

> They conceive harm and give birth to wrongdoing,  
> And their womb prepares deception.
