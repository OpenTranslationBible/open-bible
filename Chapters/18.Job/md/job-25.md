## Job 25:1

Then Bildad the Shuhite responded,

## Job 25:2

> “Dominion and awe belong to Him  
> Who makes peace in His heights.

## Job 25:3

> Is there any number to His troops?  
> And upon whom does His light not rise?

## Job 25:4

> How then can mankind be righteous with God?  
> Or how can anyone who is born of woman be pure?

## Job 25:5

> If even the moon has no brightness  
> And the stars are not pure in His sight,

## Job 25:6

> How much less man, that maggot,  
> And a son of man, that worm!”
