# Hebrews Chapter 4

## Hebrews 4:1

Therefore, let us fear if, while a promise remains of entering His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short of it.

## Hebrews 4:2

For indeed we have had good news preached to us, just as they also did; but the word they heard did not benefit them, because they were not united with those who listened with faith.

## Hebrews 4:3

For we who have believed enter that rest, just as He has said,

> “As I swore in My anger,  
> They certainly shall not enter My rest,”  
> although His works were finished from the foundation of the world.

## Hebrews 4:4

For He has said somewhere concerning the seventh day:  
“And God rested on the seventh day from all His works”;

## Hebrews 4:5

and again in this passage,  
“They certainly shall not enter My rest.”

## Hebrews 4:6

Therefore, since it remains for some to enter it, and those who previously had good news preached to them failed to enter because of disobedience,

## Hebrews 4:7

He again sets a certain day, “Today,” saying through David after so long a time just as has been said before,

> “Today, if you hear His voice,  
> Do not harden your hearts.”

## Hebrews 4:8

For if Joshua had given them rest, He would not have spoken of another day after that.

## Hebrews 4:9

So there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God.

## Hebrews 4:10

For the one who has entered His rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from His.

## Hebrews 4:11

Therefore let’s make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall by following the same example of disobedience.

## Hebrews 4:12

For the word of God is living and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, even penetrating as far as the division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.

## Hebrews 4:13

And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of Him to whom we must answer.

## Hebrews 4:14

Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let’s hold firmly to our confession.

## Hebrews 4:15

For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathise with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things just as we are, yet without sin.

## Hebrews 4:16

Therefore let’s approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace for help at the time of our need.
