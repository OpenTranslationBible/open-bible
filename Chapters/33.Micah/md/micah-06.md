# Micah Chapter 6

## Micah 6:1

Hear now what the Lord is saying:

> “Arise, plead your case before the mountains,  
> And have the hills hear your voice.

## Micah 6:2

> Listen, you mountains, to the indictment by the Lord,  
> And you enduring foundations of the earth,  
> Because the Lord has a case against His people,  
> And He will dispute with Israel.

## Micah 6:3

> My people, what have I done to you,  
> And how have I wearied you? Answer Me.

## Micah 6:4

> Indeed, I brought you up from the land of Egypt,  
> I redeemed you from the house of slavery,  
> And I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.

## Micah 6:5

> My people, remember now  
> What Balak king of Moab planned,  
> And what Balaam son of Beor answered him,  
> And what happened from Shittim to Gilgal,  
> So that you might know the righteous acts of the Lord.”

## Micah 6:6

> With what shall I come to the Lord  
> And bow myself before the God on high?  
> Shall I come to Him with burnt offerings,  
> With year-old calves?

## Micah 6:7

> Does the Lord take pleasure in thousands of rams,  
> In ten thousand rivers of oil?  
> Shall I give Him my firstborn for my wrongdoing,  
> The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?

## Micah 6:8

> He has told you, mortal one, what is good;  
> And what does the Lord require of you  
> But to do justice, to love kindness,  
> And to walk humbly with your God?

## Micah 6:9

> The voice of the Lord will call to the city—  
> And it is sound wisdom to fear Your name:  
> “Hear, you tribe. Who has designated its time?

## Micah 6:10

> Is there still a person in the wicked house,  
> With treasures of wickedness,  
> And a short measure that is cursed?

## Micah 6:11

> Can I justify dishonest balances,  
> And a bag of fraudulent weights?

## Micah 6:12

> For the rich people of the city are full of violence,  
> Her residents speak lies,  
> And their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.

## Micah 6:13

> So also I will make you sick, striking you down,  
> Making you desolate because of your sins.

## Micah 6:14

> You will eat, but you will not be satisfied,  
> And your filth will be in your midst.  
> You will try to remove valuables for safekeeping,  
> But you will not save it all,  
> And what you do save I will turn over to the sword.

## Micah 6:15

> You will sow, but you will not harvest.  
> You will tread the olive press, but will not anoint yourself with oil;  
> And tread grapes, but you will not drink wine.

## Micah 6:16

> The statutes of Omri  
> And every work of the house of Ahab are maintained,  
> And you walk by their plans.  
> Therefore I will give you up for destruction,  
> And your inhabitants for derision,  
> And you will suffer the taunting of My people.”
