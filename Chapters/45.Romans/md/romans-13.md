# Romans Chapter 13

## Romans 13:1

Every person is to be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist are established by God.

## Romans 13:2

Therefore whoever resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves.

## Romans 13:3

For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behaviour, but for evil. Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good and you will have praise from the same;

## Romans 13:4

For it is a servant of God to you for good. But if you do evil, be afraid; for it does not bear the sword for nothing. For it is a servant of God, an avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices evil.

## Romans 13:5

Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only because of wrath, but also for the sake of conscience.

## Romans 13:6

For because of this you also pay taxes, for rulers are servants of God, devoting themselves to this very thing.

## Romans 13:7

Pay to all what is due them: tax to whom tax is due, custom to whom custom, respect to whom respect, honour to whom honour.

## Romans 13:8

Owe nothing to anyone except to love one another; for the one who loves his neighbour has fulfilled the Law.

## Romans 13:9

For this, “You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,” and if there is any other commandment, it is summed up in this saying, “You shall love your neighbour as yourself.”

## Romans 13:10

Love does no wrong to a neighbour; therefore love is the fulfilment of the Law.

## Romans 13:11

Do this, knowing the time, that it is already the hour for you to awaken from sleep; for now salvation is nearer to us than when we first believed.

## Romans 13:12

The night is almost gone, and the day is near. Therefore let us lay aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armour of light.

## Romans 13:13

Let us behave properly as in the day, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual promiscuity and debauchery, not in strife and jealousy.

## Romans 13:14

But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh in regard to its lusts.
