# Amos Chapter 5

## Amos 5:1

Hear this word which I am taking up for you as a song of mourning, house of Israel:

## Amos 5:2

> “She has fallen, she will not rise again—  
> The virgin Israel.  
> She lies unnoticed on her land;  
> There is no one to raise her up.”

## Amos 5:3

For this is what the Lord God says:

> “The city which goes forth a thousand strong  
> Will have a hundred left,  
> And the one which goes forth a hundred strong  
> Will have ten left to the house of Israel.”

## Amos 5:4

For this is what the Lord says to the house of Israel:

> “Seek Me so that you may live.

## Amos 5:5

> But do not resort to Bethel,  
> And do not come to Gilgal,  
> Nor cross over to Beersheba;  
> For Gilgal will certainly go into captivity,  
> And Bethel will come to nothing.

## Amos 5:6

> Seek the Lord so that you may live,  
> Or He will break through like fire, house of Joseph,  
> And it will consume with no one to extinguish it for Bethel,

## Amos 5:7

> For those who turn justice into wormwood,  
> And throw righteousness to the earth.”

## Amos 5:8

> He who made the Pleiades and Orion,  
> And changes deep darkness into morning,  
> Who also darkens day into night,  
> Who calls for the waters of the sea  
> And pours them out on the surface of the earth,  
> The Lord is His name.

## Amos 5:9

> It is He who makes destruction flash upon the strong,  
> So that destruction comes upon the fortress.

## Amos 5:10

> They hate one who rebukes in the gate,  
> And they despise one who speaks with integrity.

## Amos 5:11

> Therefore because you impose heavy rent on the poor  
> And take a tribute of grain from them,  
> Though you have built houses of cut stone,  
> Yet you will not live in them;  
> You have planted beautiful vineyards,  
> Yet you will not drink their wine.

## Amos 5:12

> For I know your offences are many and your sins are great,  
> You who are hostile to the righteous and accept bribes,  
> And turn away the poor from justice at the gate.

## Amos 5:13

> Therefore at such a time the prudent person keeps quiet,  
> Because it is an evil time.

## Amos 5:14

> Seek good and not evil, so that you may live;  
> And so may the Lord God of armies be with you,  
> Just as you have said!

## Amos 5:15

> Hate evil, love good,  
> And establish justice in the gate!  
> Perhaps the Lord God of armies  
> Will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.

## Amos 5:16

Therefore this is what the Lord God of armies,

> The Lord, says:  
> “There is mourning in all the public squares,  
> And in all the streets they say, ‘Oh no! Oh no!’  
> They also call the farmer to mourning  
> And professional mourners to mourning rituals.

## Amos 5:17

> And in all the vineyards there is mourning,  
> Because I will pass through the midst of you,” says the Lord.

## Amos 5:18

> Woe to you who are longing for the day of the Lord!  
> For what purpose will the day of the Lord be to you?  
> It will be darkness and not light;

## Amos 5:19

> As when a person flees from a lion  
> And a bear meets him,  
> Or he goes home, leans with his hand against the wall,  
> And a snake bites him.

## Amos 5:20

> Will the day of the Lord not be darkness instead of light,  
> Even gloom with no brightness in it?

## Amos 5:21

> “I hate, I reject your festivals,  
> Nor do I delight in your festive assemblies.

## Amos 5:22

> Even though you offer up to Me burnt offerings and your grain offerings,  
> I will not accept them.  
> And I will not even look at the peace offerings of your fattened oxen.

## Amos 5:23

> Take away from Me the noise of your songs;  
> I will not even listen to the sound of your harps.

## Amos 5:24

> But let justice roll out like waters,  
> And righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.

## Amos 5:25

> Did you present Me with sacrifices and grain offerings in the wilderness for forty years, house of Israel?

## Amos 5:26

> You also carried along Sikkuth your king and Kiyyun, your images,  
> The star of your gods which you made for yourselves.

## Amos 5:27

> Therefore, I will make you go into exile beyond Damascus,” says the Lord, whose name is the God of armies.
