# Amos Chapter 3

## Amos 3:1

Hear this word which the Lord has spoken against you, sons of Israel,  
Against the entire family which He brought up from the land of Egypt:

## Amos 3:2

> “You only have I known among all the families of the earth;  
> Therefore I will punish you for all your wrongdoing.”

## Amos 3:3

> Do two people walk together unless they have agreed to meet?

## Amos 3:4

> Does a lion roar in the forest when he has no prey?  
> Does a young lion growl from his den unless he has captured something?

## Amos 3:5

> Does a bird fall into a trap on the ground when there is no device in it?  
> Does a trap spring up from the earth when it captures nothing at all?

## Amos 3:6

> If a trumpet is blown in a city, will the people not tremble?  
> If a disaster occurs in a city, has the Lord not brought it about?

## Amos 3:7

> Certainly the Lord God does nothing  
> Unless He reveals His secret plan  
> To His servants the prophets.

## Amos 3:8

> A lion has roared! Who will not fear?  
> The Lord God has spoken! Who can do anything but prophesy?

## Amos 3:9

> Proclaim on the citadels in Ashdod and on the citadels in the land of Egypt,  
> And say, “Assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria,  
> And see the great panic within her  
> And the oppressions in her midst.

## Amos 3:10

> But they do not know how to do what is right,” declares the Lord,  
> “These who store up violence and devastation in their citadels.”

## Amos 3:11

Therefore, this is what the Lord God says:

> “An enemy, one surrounding the land,  
> Will take down your fortifications from you,  
> And your citadels will be looted.”

## Amos 3:12

This is what the Lord says:

> “Just as the shepherd snatches from the lion’s mouth  
> A couple of legs or a piece of an ear,  
> So will the sons of Israel living in Samaria be snatched away—  
> With the corner of a bed and the cover of a couch!

## Amos 3:13

Hear and testify against the house of Jacob,”  
Declares the Lord God, the God of armies.

## Amos 3:14

> “For on the day that I punish Israel’s offences,  
> I will also punish the altars of Bethel;  
> The horns of the altar will be cut off,  
> And will fall to the ground.

## Amos 3:15

> I will also strike the winter house together with the summer house;  
> The houses of ivory will also perish,  
> And the great houses will come to an end,”  
> Declares the Lord.
