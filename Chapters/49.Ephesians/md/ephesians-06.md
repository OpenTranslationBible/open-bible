In addition to all, taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.

And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.

## Ephesians 6:19

And pray on my behalf, that speech may be given to me in the opening of my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel,

## Ephesians 6:20

For which I am an ambassador in chains; that in proclaiming it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.

Now, so that you also may know about my circumstances as to what I am doing, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord, will make everything known to you.

I have sent him to you for this very purpose, so that you may know about us, and that he may comfort your hearts.
