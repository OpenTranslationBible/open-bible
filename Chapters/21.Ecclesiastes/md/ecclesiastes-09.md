# Ecclesiastes Chapter 9

## Ecclesiastes 9:1

For I have taken all this to my heart and explained it,  
That righteous people, wise people, and their deeds are in the hand of God.  
People do not know whether it will be love or hatred;  
Anything awaits them.

## Ecclesiastes 9:2

It is the same for all:  
There is one fate for the righteous and the wicked;  
For the good, the clean, and the unclean;  
For the one who offers a sacrifice and the one who does not sacrifice.  
As the good person is, so is the sinner;  
The one who swears is just like the one who is afraid to swear.

## Ecclesiastes 9:3

This is an evil in everything that is done under the sun,  
That there is one fate for everyone.  
Furthermore, the hearts of people are full of evil,  
And insanity is in their hearts throughout their lives.  
Afterward they go to the dead.

## Ecclesiastes 9:4

For whoever is joined to all the living, there is hope;  
For a live dog is better than a dead lion.

## Ecclesiastes 9:5

For the living know that they will die;  
But the dead do not know anything,  
Nor do they have a reward any longer,  
For their memory is forgotten.

## Ecclesiastes 9:6

Indeed their love, their hatred, and their zeal have already perished,  
And they will no longer have a share in anything that is done under the sun.

## Ecclesiastes 9:7

Go then, eat your bread in happiness,  
And drink your wine with a cheerful heart;  
For God has already approved your works.

## Ecclesiastes 9:8

See that your garments are white all the time,  
And that there is no lack of oil on your head.

## Ecclesiastes 9:9

Enjoy life with the wife whom you love all the days of your futile life,  
Which He has given you under the sun,  
All the days of your futility;  
For this is your reward in life and in your work in which you have laboured under the sun.

## Ecclesiastes 9:10

Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might;  
For there is no activity, planning, knowledge, or wisdom in Sheol where you are going.

## Ecclesiastes 9:11

I again saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift,  
Nor the battle to the warriors,  
Nor bread to the wise,  
Nor wealth to the discerning,  
Nor favour to people of ability;  
For time and chance overtake them all.

## Ecclesiastes 9:12

Moreover, no one knows his time:  
Like fish caught in a treacherous net,  
And birds caught in a snare,  
So the sons of mankind are ensnared at an evil time when it suddenly falls on them.

## Ecclesiastes 9:13

This too I came to see as wisdom under the sun,  
And it impressed me:

## Ecclesiastes 9:14

There was a small city with few men in it,  
And a great king came to it, surrounded it,  
And constructed large siegeworks against it.

## Ecclesiastes 9:15

But there was found in it a poor wise man,  
And he saved the city by his wisdom.  
Yet no one remembered that poor man.

## Ecclesiastes 9:16

So I said, “Wisdom is better than strength.”  
But the wisdom of the poor is despised,  
And his words are ignored.

## Ecclesiastes 9:17

The words of the wise heard in calm  
Are better than the shouting of a ruler among fools.

## Ecclesiastes 9:18

Wisdom is better than weapons of war,  
But one sinner destroys much good.
