# Ecclesiastes Chapter 5

## Ecclesiastes 5:1

Guard your steps as you go to the house of God,  
And approach to listen rather than to offer the sacrifice of fools;  
For they do not know that they are doing evil.

## Ecclesiastes 5:2

Do not be quick with your mouth or impulsive in thought  
To bring up a matter in the presence of God.  
For God is in heaven and you are on the earth;  
Therefore let your words be few.

## Ecclesiastes 5:3

For the dream comes through much effort,  
And the voice of a fool through many words.

## Ecclesiastes 5:4

When you make a vow to God, do not be late in paying it;  
For He takes no delight in fools.  
Pay what you vow!

## Ecclesiastes 5:5

It is better that you do not vow,  
Than vow and not pay.

## Ecclesiastes 5:6

Do not allow your speech to cause you to sin,  
And do not say in the presence of the messenger of God that it was a mistake.  
Why should God be angry because of your voice and destroy the work of your hands?

## Ecclesiastes 5:7

For in many dreams and in many words there is futility.  
Rather, fear God.

## Ecclesiastes 5:8

If you see oppression of the poor and denial of justice and righteousness in the province,  
Do not be shocked at the sight;  
For one official watches over another official,  
And there are higher officials over them.

## Ecclesiastes 5:9

After all, a king who cultivates the field is beneficial to the land.

## Ecclesiastes 5:10

One who loves money will not be satisfied with money,  
Nor one who loves abundance with its income.  
This too is vanity.

## Ecclesiastes 5:11

When good things increase, those who consume them increase.  
So what is the advantage to their owners,  
Except to look on?

## Ecclesiastes 5:12

The sleep of the labourer is sweet, whether he eats little or much;  
But the full stomach of the rich does not allow him to sleep.

## Ecclesiastes 5:13

There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun:  
Riches being hoarded by their owner to his detriment.

## Ecclesiastes 5:14

When those riches were lost through bad business,  
And he had fathered a son, then there was nothing to support him.

## Ecclesiastes 5:15

As he came naked from his mother’s womb, so he will return as he came.  
He will take nothing from the fruit of his labour  
That he can carry in his hand.

## Ecclesiastes 5:16

This also is a grievous evil—exactly as a person is born, so will he die.  
What then is the advantage for him who labours for the wind?

## Ecclesiastes 5:17

All his life he also eats in darkness,  
With great irritation, sickness, and anger.

## Ecclesiastes 5:18

Here is what I have seen to be good and fitting:  
To eat, to drink, and enjoy oneself in all one’s labour  
In which he labours under the sun during the few years of his life  
Which God has given him; for this is his reward.

## Ecclesiastes 5:19

Furthermore, as for every person to whom God has given riches and wealth,  
He has also empowered him to eat from them and to receive his reward  
And rejoice in his labour; this is the gift of God.

## Ecclesiastes 5:20

For he will not often call to mind the days of his life,  
Because God keeps him occupied with the joy of his heart.
