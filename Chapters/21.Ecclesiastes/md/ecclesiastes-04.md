# Ecclesiastes Chapter 4

## Ecclesiastes 4:1

Then I looked again at all the acts of oppression which were being done under the sun.  
And behold, I saw the tears of the oppressed and that they had no one to comfort them;  
And power was on the side of their oppressors,  
But they had no one to comfort them.

## Ecclesiastes 4:2

So I congratulated the dead who are already dead,  
More than the living who are still alive.

## Ecclesiastes 4:3

But better off than both of them is the one who has never existed,  
Who has never seen the evil activity that is done under the sun.

## Ecclesiastes 4:4

I have seen that every labour and every skill which is done  
Is the result of rivalry between a person and his neighbour.  
This too is vanity and striving after wind.

## Ecclesiastes 4:5

The fool folds his hands  
And consumes his own flesh.

## Ecclesiastes 4:6

One hand full of rest is better  
Than two fists full of labour and striving after wind.

## Ecclesiastes 4:7

Then I looked again at futility under the sun.

## Ecclesiastes 4:8

There was a man without a dependent,  
Having neither a son nor a brother,  
Yet there was no end to all his labour.  
Indeed, his eyes were not satisfied with riches,  
And he never asked, “And for whom do I labour and deprive myself of pleasure?”  
This too is futility, and it is an unhappy task.

## Ecclesiastes 4:9

Two are better than one,  
Because they have a good return for their labour.

## Ecclesiastes 4:10

For if either of them falls, the one will lift up his companion.  
But woe to the one who falls when there is not another to lift him up!

## Ecclesiastes 4:11

Furthermore, if two lie down together they keep warm,  
But how can one be warm alone?

## Ecclesiastes 4:12

And if one can overpower him who is alone,  
Two can resist him.  
A cord of three strands is not quickly torn apart.

## Ecclesiastes 4:13

A poor yet wise youth is better than an old and foolish king  
Who no longer knows how to receive instruction.

## Ecclesiastes 4:14

For he has come out of prison to become king,  
Even though he was born poor in his kingdom.

## Ecclesiastes 4:15

I have seen all the living who move about under the sun  
Go over to the side of the second youth who takes his place.

## Ecclesiastes 4:16

There is no end to all the people, to all who were before them,  
And even the ones who come later will not be happy with him;  
For this too is vanity and striving after wind.
