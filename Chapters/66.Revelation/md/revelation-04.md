# Revelation Chapter 4

## Revelation 4:1

After these things I looked, and behold, a door was standing open in heaven, and the first voice which I had heard, like the sound of a trumpet speaking with me, said, “Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after these things.”

## Revelation 4:2

Immediately I was in the Spirit; and behold, a throne was standing in heaven, and someone was sitting on the throne.

## Revelation 4:3

And He who was sitting was like a jasper stone and a sardius in appearance; and there was a rainbow around the throne, like an emerald in appearance.

## Revelation 4:4

Around the throne were twenty-four thrones; and upon the thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white garments, and golden crowns on their heads.

## Revelation 4:5

Out from the throne came flashes of lightning and sounds and peals of thunder. And there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God;

## Revelation 4:6

and before the throne there was something like a sea of glass, like crystal; and in the center and around the throne, four living creatures full of eyes in front and behind.

## Revelation 4:7

The first creature was like a lion, and the second creature like a calf, and the third creature had a face like that of a man, and the fourth creature was like a flying eagle.

## Revelation 4:8

And the four living creatures, each one of them having six wings, are full of eyes around and within; and day and night they do not cease to say,

> “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty,  
> Who was, and who is, and who is to come.”

## Revelation 4:9

And when the living creatures give glory, honour, and thanks to Him who sits on the throne, to Him who lives forever and ever,

## Revelation 4:10

the twenty-four elders will fall down before Him who sits on the throne, and they will worship Him who lives forever and ever, and will cast their crowns before the throne, saying,

## Revelation 4:11

> “Worthy are You, our Lord and our God,  
> To receive glory and honour and power;  
> For You created all things,  
> And because of Your will they existed, and were created.”
