# Matthew Chapter 21

## Matthew 21:1

When they had approached Jerusalem and had come to Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives,  
Jesus then sent two disciples,

## Matthew 21:2

saying to them,  
“Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied there and a colt with it;  
untie them and bring them to Me.

## Matthew 21:3

And if anyone says anything to you, you shall say, ‘The Lord needs them,’  
and he will send them on immediately.”

## Matthew 21:4

Now this took place so that what was spoken through the prophet would be fulfilled:

## Matthew 21:5

“Say to the daughter of Zion,  
‘Behold your King is coming to you,  
Humble, and mounted on a donkey,  
Even on a colt, the foal of a donkey.’”

## Matthew 21:6

The disciples went and did just as Jesus had instructed them,

## Matthew 21:7

and brought the donkey and the colt, and laid their cloaks on them;  
and He sat on the cloaks.

## Matthew 21:8

Most of the crowd spread their cloaks on the road,  
and others were cutting branches from the trees and spreading them on the road.

## Matthew 21:9

Now the crowds going ahead of Him, and those who followed, were shouting,  
“Hosanna to the Son of David;  
Blessed is the One who comes in the name of the Lord;  
Hosanna in the highest!”

## Matthew 21:10

When He had entered Jerusalem, all the city was stirred, saying, “Who is this?”

## Matthew 21:11

And the crowds were saying, “This is Jesus the prophet, from Nazareth in Galilee.”

## Matthew 21:12

And Jesus entered the temple and drove out all those who were buying and selling in the temple,  
and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who were selling doves.

## Matthew 21:13

And He said to them,  
“It is written: ‘My house will be called a house of prayer’;  
but you are making it a den of robbers.”

## Matthew 21:14

And those who were blind and those who limped came to Him in the temple, and He healed them.

## Matthew 21:15

But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that He had done,  
and the children who were shouting in the temple,  
“Hosanna to the Son of David,” they became indignant,

## Matthew 21:16

and they said to Him, “Do You hear what these children are saying?”  
And Jesus said to them,  
“Yes. Have you never read, ‘From the mouths of infants and nursing babies You have prepared praise for Yourself’?”

## Matthew 21:17

And He left them and went out of the city to Bethany, and spent the night there.

---

## Matthew 21:18

Now in the early morning, when He was returning to the city, He became hungry.

## Matthew 21:19

And seeing a lone fig tree by the road, He came to it and found nothing on it except leaves alone;  
and He said to it, “No longer shall there ever be any fruit from you.”  
And at once the fig tree withered.

## Matthew 21:20

Seeing this, the disciples were amazed and said,  
“How did the fig tree wither all at once?”

## Matthew 21:21

And Jesus answered and said to them,  
“Truly I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt,  
you will not only do what was done to the fig tree,  
but even if you say to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and thrown into the sea,’ it will happen.

## Matthew 21:22

And whatever you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.”

---

## Matthew 21:23

When He entered the temple area, the chief priests and elders of the people came to Him while He was teaching,  
and said, “By what authority are You doing these things, and who gave You this authority?”

## Matthew 21:24

But Jesus responded and said to them,  
“I will also ask you one question, and if you tell Me, I will also tell you by what authority I do these things.

## Matthew 21:25

The baptism of John was from what source: from heaven or from men?”  
And they began reasoning among themselves, saying,  
“If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will say to us, ‘Then why did you not believe him?’

## Matthew 21:26

But if we say, ‘From men,’ we fear the people; for they all regard John as a prophet.”

## Matthew 21:27

And answering Jesus, they said, “We do not know.”  
He also said to them,  
“Neither am I telling you by what authority I do these things.”

---

## Matthew 21:28

“But what do you think?  
A man had two sons, and he came to the first and said,  
‘Son, go work today in the vineyard.’

## Matthew 21:29

But he replied, ‘I will not’; yet afterward he regretted it and went.

## Matthew 21:30

The man came to the second son and said the same thing;  
and he replied, ‘I will, sir’; yet he did not go.

## Matthew 21:31

Which of the two did the will of his father?”  
They said, “The first.”  
Jesus said to them,  
“Truly I say to you that tax collectors and prostitutes will get into the kingdom of God before you.

## Matthew 21:32

For John came to you in the way of righteousness and you did not believe him;  
but the tax collectors and prostitutes did believe him;  
and you, seeing this, did not even feel remorse afterward so as to believe him.

## Matthew 21:33

“Listen to another parable.  
There was a landowner who planted a vineyard and put a fence around it,  
and dug a wine press in it, and built a tower,  
and he leased it to vine-growers and went on a journey.

## Matthew 21:34

And when the harvest time approached, he sent his slaves to the vine-growers to receive his fruit.

## Matthew 21:35

And the vine-growers took his slaves and beat one, killed another, and stoned another.

## Matthew 21:36

Again, he sent other slaves, more than the first; and they did the same things to them.

## Matthew 21:37

But afterward he sent his son to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’

## Matthew 21:38

But when the vine-growers saw the son, they said among themselves,  
‘This is the heir; come, let’s kill him and take possession of his inheritance!’

## Matthew 21:39

And they took him and threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.

## Matthew 21:40

Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vine-growers?”

## Matthew 21:41

They said to Him,  
“He will bring those wretches to a wretched end, and lease the vineyard to other vine-growers,  
who will pay him the fruit in the proper seasons.”

## Matthew 21:42

Jesus said to them,  
“Did you never read in the Scriptures,  
‘A stone which the builders rejected,  
This has become the chief cornerstone;  
This came about from the Lord,  
And it is marvellous in our eyes’?

## Matthew 21:43

Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you,  
and given to a people producing its fruit.

## Matthew 21:44

And the one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces;  
and on whomever it falls, it will crush him.”

## Matthew 21:45

When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard His parables, they understood that He was speaking about them.

## Matthew 21:46

And although they sought to arrest Him, they feared the crowds, since they considered Him to be a prophet.
