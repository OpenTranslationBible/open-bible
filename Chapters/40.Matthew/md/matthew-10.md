# Matthew Chapter 10

## Matthew 10:1

Jesus summoned His twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits,  
to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every sickness.

## Matthew 10:2

Now the names of the twelve apostles are these:  
The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother;  
and James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother;

## Matthew 10:3

Philip and Bartholomew;  
Thomas and Matthew the tax collector;  
James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;

## Matthew 10:4

Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, the one who also betrayed Him.

---

## Matthew 10:5

These twelve Jesus sent out after instructing them, saying,  
“Do not go on a road to Gentiles, and do not enter a city of Samaritans;

## Matthew 10:6

but rather go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

## Matthew 10:7

And as you go, preach, saying, ‘The kingdom of heaven has come near.’

## Matthew 10:8

Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse those with leprosy, cast out demons.  
Freely you received, freely give.

## Matthew 10:9

Do not acquire gold, or silver, or copper for your money belts,

## Matthew 10:10

or a bag for your journey, or even two tunics, or sandals, or a staff;  
for the worker is deserving of his support.

---

## Matthew 10:11

And whatever city or village you enter, find out who is worthy in it,  
and stay there until you leave.

## Matthew 10:12

As you enter the house, give it your greeting.

## Matthew 10:13

If the house is worthy, see that your blessing of peace comes upon it.  
But if it is not worthy, take back your blessing of peace.

## Matthew 10:14

And if anyone does not receive you, nor listen to your words,  
leave that house or that city and shake the dust off your feet.

## Matthew 10:15

Truly I say to you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah  
on the day of judgment than for that city.

---

## Matthew 10:16

Behold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves;  
so be as shrewd as serpents and as innocent as doves.

## Matthew 10:17

But beware of people, for they will hand you over to the courts  
and flog you in their synagogues;

## Matthew 10:18

and you will even be brought before governors and kings on My account,  
as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.

## Matthew 10:19

But when they hand you over, do not worry about how or what you are to say;  
for what you are to say will be given you at that time.

## Matthew 10:20

For it is not you who are speaking, but it is the Spirit of your Father who is speaking in you.

---

## Matthew 10:21

Now brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child;  
and children will rise up against parents and cause them to be put to death.

## Matthew 10:22

And you will be hated by all because of My name,  
but it is the one who has endured to the end who will be saved.

## Matthew 10:23

But whenever they persecute you in one city, flee to the next;  
for truly I say to you, you will not finish going through the cities of Israel  
until the Son of Man comes.

---

## Matthew 10:24

A disciple is not above the teacher, nor a slave above his master.

## Matthew 10:25

It is enough for the disciple that he becomes like his teacher, and the slave like his master.  
If they have called the head of the house Beelzebul,  
how much more will they insult the members of his household!

---

## Matthew 10:26

So do not fear them, for there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed,  
or hidden that will not be known.

## Matthew 10:27

What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light;  
and what you hear whispered in your ear, proclaim on the housetops.

## Matthew 10:28

And do not be afraid of those who kill the body but are unable to kill the soul;  
but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.

## Matthew 10:29

Are two sparrows not sold for an assarion?  
And yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father.

## Matthew 10:30

But even the hairs of your head are all counted.

## Matthew 10:31

So do not fear; you are more valuable than a great number of sparrows.

---

## Matthew 10:32

Therefore, everyone who confesses Me before people,  
I will also confess him before My Father who is in heaven.

## Matthew 10:33

But whoever denies Me before people,  
I will also deny him before My Father who is in heaven.

---

## Matthew 10:34

Do not think that I came to bring peace on the earth;  
I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.

## Matthew 10:35

For I came to turn

> a man against his father,
> and a daughter against her mother,
> and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;

## Matthew 10:36

> and a person’s enemies will be the members of his household.

---

## Matthew 10:37

The one who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me;  
and the one who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me.

## Matthew 10:38

And the one who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me.

## Matthew 10:39

The one who has found his life will lose it,  
and the one who has lost his life on My account will find it.

---

## Matthew 10:40

The one who receives you receives Me,  
and the one who receives Me receives Him who sent Me.

## Matthew 10:41

The one who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward;  
and the one who receives a righteous person in the name of a righteous person  
shall receive a righteous person’s reward.

## Matthew 10:42

And whoever gives one of these little ones just a cup of cold water to drink  
in the name of a disciple, truly I say to you, he shall by no means lose his reward.
