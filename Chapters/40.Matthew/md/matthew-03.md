# Matthew Chapter 3

## Matthew 3:1

Now in those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying,

## Matthew 3:2

“Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”

## Matthew 3:3

For this is the one referred to by Isaiah the prophet when he said,  
“The voice of one calling out in the wilderness,  
‘Prepare the way of the Lord,  
Make His paths straight!’”

## Matthew 3:4

Now John himself had a garment of camel’s hair and a leather belt around his waist;  
and his food was locusts and wild honey.

## Matthew 3:5

At that time Jerusalem was going out to him, and all Judea and all the region around the Jordan;

## Matthew 3:6

and they were being baptised by him in the Jordan River, as they confessed their sins.

## Matthew 3:7

But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism,  
he said to them, “You offspring of vipers,  
who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?

## Matthew 3:8

Therefore produce fruit consistent with repentance;

## Matthew 3:9

and do not assume that you can say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father’;  
for I tell you that God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham.

## Matthew 3:10

And the axe is already laid at the root of the trees;  
therefore every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.

## Matthew 3:11

As for me, I baptise you with water for repentance,  
but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, and I am not fit to remove His sandals;  
He will baptise you with the Holy Spirit and fire.

## Matthew 3:12

His winnowing fork is in His hand,  
and He will thoroughly clear His threshing floor;  
and He will gather His wheat into the barn,  
but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”

and yet You are coming to me?”

## Matthew 3:15

But Jesus, answering, said to him,  
“Allow it at this time; for in this way it is fitting for us to fulfil all righteousness.”

After He was baptised, Jesus came up immediately from the water;  
and behold, the heavens were opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and coming upon Him,

and behold, a voice from the heavens said,  
“This is My beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.”
