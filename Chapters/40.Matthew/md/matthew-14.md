# Matthew Chapter 14

## Matthew 14:1

At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the news about Jesus,

## Matthew 14:2

and said to his servants,  
“This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead, and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him.”

---

## Matthew 14:3

For when Herod had arrested John, he bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias,  
the wife of his brother Philip.

## Matthew 14:4

For John had been saying to him, “It is not lawful for you to have her.”

## Matthew 14:5

Although Herod wanted to put him to death, he feared the crowd, because they regarded John as a prophet.

---

## Matthew 14:6

But when Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod,

## Matthew 14:7

so much that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked.

## Matthew 14:8

And after being prompted by her mother, she said,  
“Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter.”

## Matthew 14:9

Although he was grieved, the king commanded it to be given because of his oaths and his dinner guests.

## Matthew 14:10

He sent orders and had John beheaded in the prison.

## Matthew 14:11

And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.

## Matthew 14:12

John’s disciples came and took the body and buried it; and they went and reported to Jesus.

---

## Matthew 14:13

Now when Jesus heard about John, He withdrew from there in a boat to a secluded place by Himself;  
and when the crowds heard about this, they followed Him on foot from the cities.

## Matthew 14:14

When He came ashore, He saw a large crowd, and felt compassion for them and healed their sick.

---

## Matthew 14:15

Now when it was evening, the disciples came to Him and said,  
“This place is secluded and the hour is already late;  
send the crowds away so that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves.”

## Matthew 14:16

But Jesus said to them, “They do not need to go; you give them something to eat!”

## Matthew 14:17

They said to Him, “We have nothing here except five loaves and two fish.”

## Matthew 14:18

And He said, “Bring them here to Me.”

## Matthew 14:19

And ordering the crowds to sit down on the grass, He took the five loaves and the two fish,  
and looking up toward heaven, He blessed the food,  
and breaking the loaves He gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.

## Matthew 14:20

And they all ate and were satisfied,  
and they picked up what was left over of the broken pieces: twelve full baskets.

## Matthew 14:21

There were about five thousand men who ate, besides women and children.

## Matthew 14:22

Immediately afterward He compelled the disciples to get into the boat  
and go ahead of Him to the other side, while He sent the crowds away.

## Matthew 14:23

After He had sent the crowds away, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray;  
and when it was evening, He was there alone.

## Matthew 14:24

But the boat was already a long distance from the land,  
battered by the waves; for the wind was contrary.

## Matthew 14:25

And in the fourth watch of the night He came to them, walking on the sea.

## Matthew 14:26

When the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were terrified, and said,  
“It is a ghost!” And they cried out in fear.

## Matthew 14:27

But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying,  
“Take courage, it is I; do not be afraid.”

## Matthew 14:28

Peter responded and said to Him,  
“Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the water.”

## Matthew 14:29

And He said, “Come!”  
And Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water, and came toward Jesus.

## Matthew 14:30

But seeing the wind, he became frightened, and when he began to sink,  
he cried out, saying, “Lord, save me!”

## Matthew 14:31

Immediately Jesus reached out with His hand and took hold of him, and said to him,  
“You of little faith, why did you doubt?”

## Matthew 14:32

When they got into the boat, the wind stopped.

## Matthew 14:33

And those who were in the boat worshipped Him, saying,  
“You are truly God’s Son!”

---

## Matthew 14:34

When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret.

## Matthew 14:35

And when the men of that place recognised Him,  
they sent word into all that surrounding region and brought to Him all who were sick;

## Matthew 14:36

and they pleaded with Him that they might just touch the border of His cloak;  
and all who touched it were cured.
