## Matthew 19:1

When Jesus had finished these words, He left Galilee and came into the region of Judea beyond the Jordan;

## Matthew 19:2

and large crowds followed Him, and He healed them there.

## Matthew 19:3

Some Pharisees came to Jesus, testing Him and asking,  
“Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason at all?”

## Matthew 19:4

And He answered and said,  
“Have you not read that He who created them from the beginning made them male and female,

## Matthew 19:5

and said,  
‘For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife,  
and the two shall become one flesh’?

## Matthew 19:6

So they are no longer two, but one flesh.  
Therefore, what God has joined together, no person is to separate.”

## Matthew 19:7

They said to Him,  
“Why, then, did Moses command to give her a certificate of divorce and send her away?”

## Matthew 19:8

He said to them,  
“Because of your hardness of heart Moses permitted you to divorce your wives;  
but from the beginning it has not been this way.

## Matthew 19:9

And I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.”

## Matthew 19:10

The disciples said to Him,  
“If the relationship of the man with his wife is like this, it is better not to marry.”

## Matthew 19:11

But He said to them,  
“Not all men can accept this statement, but only those to whom it has been given.

## Matthew 19:12

For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mother’s womb;  
and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men;  
and there are also eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.  
The one who is able to accept this, let him accept it.”

## Matthew 19:13

Then some children were brought to Him so that He would lay His hands on them and pray;  
and the disciples rebuked them.

## Matthew 19:14

But Jesus said,  
“Leave the children alone, and do not forbid them to come to Me;  
for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.”

## Matthew 19:15

After laying His hands on them, He departed from there.

## Matthew 19:16

And someone came to Him and said,  
“Teacher, what good thing shall I do so that I may obtain eternal life?”

## Matthew 19:17

And He said to him,  
“Why are you asking Me about what is good? There is only One who is good;  
but if you want to enter life, keep the commandments.”

## Matthew 19:18

Then he said to Him, “Which ones?”  
And Jesus said,  
“You shall not commit murder;  
You shall not commit adultery;  
You shall not steal;  
You shall not give false testimony;

## Matthew 19:19

Honor your father and mother; and  
You shall love your neighbour as yourself.”

## Matthew 19:20

The young man said to Him,  
“All these I have kept; what am I still lacking?”

## Matthew 19:21

Jesus said to him,  
“If you want to be complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor,  
and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.”

## Matthew 19:22

But when the young man heard this statement, he went away grieving;  
for he was one who owned much property.

---

## Matthew 19:23

And Jesus said to His disciples,  
“Truly I say to you, it will be hard for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven.

## Matthew 19:24

And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle  
than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.”

## Matthew 19:25

When the disciples heard this, they were very astonished, and said,  
“Then who can be saved?”

## Matthew 19:26

And looking at them, Jesus said to them,  
“With people this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”

---

## Matthew 19:27

Then Peter responded and said to Him,  
“Behold, we have left everything and followed You; what then will there be for us?”

## Matthew 19:28

And Jesus said to them,  
“Truly I say to you, that you who have followed Me, in the regeneration  
when the Son of Man will sit on His glorious throne,  
you also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

## Matthew 19:29

And everyone who has left houses, or brothers or sisters, or father or mother, or children, or farms,  
for My name’s sake, will receive many times as much, and will inherit eternal life.

## Matthew 19:30

But many who are first will be last, and the last, first.”
