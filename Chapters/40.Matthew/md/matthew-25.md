# Matthew Chapter 25

## Matthew 25:1

Then the kingdom of heaven will be comparable to ten virgins,  
who took their lamps and went out to meet the groom.

## Matthew 25:2

Five of them were foolish, and five were prudent.

## Matthew 25:3

For when the foolish took their lamps, they did not take extra oil with them;

## Matthew 25:4

but the prudent ones took oil in flasks with their lamps.

## Matthew 25:5

Now while the groom was delaying, they all became drowsy and began to sleep.

## Matthew 25:6

But at midnight there finally was a shout: ‘Behold, the groom! Come out to meet him.’

## Matthew 25:7

Then all those virgins got up and trimmed their lamps.

## Matthew 25:8

But the foolish virgins said to the prudent ones,  
‘Give us some of your oil, because our lamps are going out.’

## Matthew 25:9

However, the prudent ones answered,  
‘No, there most certainly would not be enough for us and you too;  
go instead to the merchants and buy some for yourselves.’

## Matthew 25:10

But while they were on their way to buy the oil, the groom came,  
and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast; and the door was shut.

## Matthew 25:11

Yet later, the other virgins also came, saying,  
‘Lord, lord, open up for us!’

## Matthew 25:12

But he answered,  
‘Truly I say to you, I do not know you.’

## Matthew 25:13

Be on the alert then, because you do not know the day nor the hour.

## Matthew 25:14

For it is just like a man about to go on a journey,  
who called his own slaves and entrusted his possessions to them.

## Matthew 25:15

To one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one,  
each according to his own ability; and he went on his journey.

## Matthew 25:16

The one who had received the five talents immediately went and did business with them, and earned five more talents.

## Matthew 25:17

In the same way, the one who had received the two talents earned two more.

## Matthew 25:18

But the one who had received the one talent went away,  
and dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master’s money.

## Matthew 25:19

Now after a long time, the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them.

## Matthew 25:20

The one who had received the five talents came up and brought five more talents, saying,  
‘Master, you entrusted five talents to me. See, I have earned five more talents.’

## Matthew 25:21

His master said to him,  
‘Well done, good and faithful slave.  
You were faithful with a few things, I will put you in charge of many things;  
enter the joy of your master.’

## Matthew 25:22

Also the one who had received the two talents came up and said,  
‘Master, you entrusted two talents to me. See, I have earned two more talents.’

## Matthew 25:23

His master said to him,  
‘Well done, good and faithful slave.  
You were faithful with a few things, I will put you in charge of many things;  
enter the joy of your master.’

## Matthew 25:24

Now the one who had received the one talent also came up and said,  
‘Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow,  
and gathering where you did not scatter seed.

## Matthew 25:25

And I was afraid, so I went away and hid your talent in the ground.  
See, you still have what is yours.’

## Matthew 25:26

But his master answered and said to him,  
‘You wicked, lazy slave,  
you knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I did not scatter seed.

## Matthew 25:27

Then you ought to have put my money in the bank,  
and on my arrival I would have received my money back with interest.

## Matthew 25:28

Therefore: take the talent away from him, and give it to the one who has the ten talents.

## Matthew 25:29

For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance;  
but from the one who does not have, even what he does have shall be taken away.

## Matthew 25:30

And throw the worthless slave into the outer darkness;  
in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

## Matthew 25:31

But when the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him,  
then He will sit on His glorious throne.

## Matthew 25:32

And all the nations will be gathered before Him;  
and He will separate them from one another, just as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.

## Matthew 25:33

And He will put the sheep on His right, but the goats on the left.

## Matthew 25:34

Then the King will say to those on His right,  
‘Come, you who are blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.

## Matthew 25:35

For I was hungry, and you gave Me something to eat;  
I was thirsty, and you gave Me something to drink;  
I was a stranger, and you took Me in;

## Matthew 25:36

naked, and you clothed Me;  
I was sick, and you visited Me;  
I was in prison, and you came to Me.’

## Matthew 25:37

Then the righteous will answer Him,  
‘Lord, when did we see You hungry, and feed You, or thirsty, and give You something to drink?

## Matthew 25:38

And when did we see You as a stranger, and take You in, or naked, and clothe You?

## Matthew 25:39

And when did we see You sick, or in prison, and come to You?’

## Matthew 25:40

And the King will answer and say to them,  
‘Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did it for one of the least of these brothers or sisters of Mine,  
you did it for Me.’

## Matthew 25:41

Then He will also say to those on His left,  
‘Depart from Me, you accursed people, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his angels;

## Matthew 25:42

for I was hungry, and you gave Me nothing to eat;  
I was thirsty, and you gave Me nothing to drink;

## Matthew 25:43

I was a stranger, and you did not take Me in;  
naked, and you did not clothe Me;  
sick and in prison, and you did not visit Me.’

## Matthew 25:44

Then they themselves also will answer,  
‘Lord, when did we see You hungry, or thirsty, or as a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison,  
and did not take care of You?’

## Matthew 25:45

Then He will answer them,  
‘Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did not do it for one of the least of these,  
you did not do it for Me, either.’

## Matthew 25:46

These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.
