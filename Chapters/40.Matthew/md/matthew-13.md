# Matthew Chapter 13

## Matthew 13:1

On that day Jesus had gone out of the house and was sitting by the sea.

## Matthew 13:2

And large crowds gathered to Him, so He got into a boat and sat down,  
and the whole crowd was standing on the beach.

## Matthew 13:3

And He told them many things in parables, saying,  
“Behold, the sower went out to sow;

## Matthew 13:4

and as he sowed, some seeds fell beside the road, and the birds came and ate them up.

## Matthew 13:5

Others fell on the rocky places, where they did not have much soil;  
and they sprang up immediately, because they had no depth of soil.

## Matthew 13:6

But after the sun rose, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.

## Matthew 13:7

Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns came up and choked them out.

## Matthew 13:8

But others fell on the good soil and yielded a crop, some a hundred, some sixty, and some thirty times as much.

## Matthew 13:9

The one who has ears, let him hear.”

## Matthew 13:10

And the disciples came up and said to Him,  
“Why do You speak to them in parables?”

## Matthew 13:11

And Jesus answered them,  
“To you it has been granted to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven,  
but to them it has not been granted.

## Matthew 13:12

For whoever has, to him more shall be given, and he will have an abundance;  
but whoever does not have, even what he has shall be taken away from him.

## Matthew 13:13

Therefore I speak to them in parables; because

> while seeing they do not see,  
> and while hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.

## Matthew 13:14

And in their case the prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled, which says,

> ‘You shall keep on listening, but shall not understand;  
> And you shall keep on looking, but shall not perceive;

## Matthew 13:15

> For the heart of this people has become dull,  
> With their ears they scarcely hear,  
> And they have closed their eyes,  
> Otherwise they might see with their eyes,  
> Hear with their ears,  
> Understand with their heart, and return,  
> And I would heal them.’

## Matthew 13:16

But blessed are your eyes, because they see; and your ears, because they hear.

## Matthew 13:17

For truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see, and did not see it,  
and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.

## Matthew 13:18

“Listen then to the parable of the sower.

## Matthew 13:19

When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it,  
the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart.  
This is the one sown with seed beside the road.

## Matthew 13:20

The one sown with seed on the rocky places,  
this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy;

## Matthew 13:21

yet he has no firm root in himself, but is only temporary,  
and when affliction or persecution occurs because of the word, immediately he falls away.

## Matthew 13:22

And the one sown with seed among the thorns,  
this is the one who hears the word,  
and the worry of the world and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.

## Matthew 13:23

But the one sown with seed on the good soil,  
this is the one who hears the word and understands it;  
who indeed bears fruit and produces, some a hundred, some sixty, and some thirty times as much.”

## Matthew 13:24

Jesus presented another parable to them, saying,  
“The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.

## Matthew 13:25

But while his men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and left.

## Matthew 13:26

And when the wheat sprouted and produced grain, then the weeds also became evident.

## Matthew 13:27

And the slaves of the landowner came and said to him,  
‘Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have weeds?’

## Matthew 13:28

And he said to them, ‘An enemy has done this!’  
The slaves said to him, ‘Do you want us to go and gather them up?’

## Matthew 13:29

But he said, ‘No; while you are gathering up the weeds, you may uproot the wheat with them.

## Matthew 13:30

Allow both to grow together until the harvest;  
and at the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers,  
“First gather up the weeds and bind them in bundles to burn them,  
but gather the wheat into my barn.”’”

---

## Matthew 13:31

He presented another parable to them, saying,  
“The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed,  
which a person took and sowed in his field;

## Matthew 13:32

and this is the smallest of all the seeds,  
but when it is fully grown, it is larger than the garden plants and becomes a tree,  
so that the birds of the sky come and nest in its branches.”

---

## Matthew 13:33

He spoke another parable to them:  
“The kingdom of heaven is like leaven,  
which a woman took and hid in three sata of flour until it was all leavened.”

---

## Matthew 13:34

All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables, and He did not speak to them without a parable.

## Matthew 13:35

This was so that what was spoken through the prophet would be fulfilled:  
“I will open My mouth in parables;  
I will proclaim things hidden since the foundation of the world.”

---

## Matthew 13:36

Then He left the crowds and went into the house.  
And His disciples came to Him and said,  
“Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.”

## Matthew 13:37

And He said,  
“The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man,

## Matthew 13:38

and the field is the world;  
and as for the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom;  
and the weeds are the sons of the evil one;

## Matthew 13:39

and the enemy who sowed them is the devil,  
and the harvest is the end of the age; and the reapers are angels.

## Matthew 13:40

So just as the weeds are gathered up and burned with fire,  
so shall it be at the end of the age.

## Matthew 13:41

The Son of Man will send forth His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom  
all stumbling blocks, and those who commit lawlessness,

## Matthew 13:42

and they will throw them into the furnace of fire;  
in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

## Matthew 13:43

Then the righteous will shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their Father.  
The one who has ears, let him hear.

---

## Matthew 13:44

“The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field,  
which a man found and hid again;  
and from joy over it he goes and sells everything that he has, and buys that field.

## Matthew 13:45

Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking fine pearls,

## Matthew 13:46

and upon finding one pearl of great value, he went and sold everything that he had and bought it.

## Matthew 13:47

Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet cast into the sea, and gathering fish of every kind;

## Matthew 13:48

and when it was filled, they pulled it up on the beach;  
and they sat down and gathered the good fish into containers,  
but the bad they threw away.

## Matthew 13:49

So it will be at the end of the age:  
the angels will come forth and remove the wicked from among the righteous,

## Matthew 13:50

and they will throw them into the furnace of fire;  
in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

---

## Matthew 13:51

“Have you understood all these things?” They said to Him, “Yes.”

## Matthew 13:52

And Jesus said to them,  
“Therefore every scribe who has become a disciple of the kingdom of heaven  
is like a head of a household, who brings out of his treasure things new and old.”

---

## Matthew 13:53

When Jesus had finished these parables, He departed from there.

## Matthew 13:54

And He came to His hometown and began teaching them in their synagogue,  
so that they were astonished, and said,  
“Where did this man acquire this wisdom and these miraculous powers?

## Matthew 13:55

Is this not the carpenter’s son? Is His mother not called Mary,  
and His brothers, James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?

## Matthew 13:56

And His sisters, are they not all with us?  
Where then did this man acquire all these things?”

## Matthew 13:57

And they took offense at Him. But Jesus said to them,  
“A prophet is not dishonoured except in his hometown and in his own household.”

## Matthew 13:58

And He did not do many miracles there because of their unbelief.
