# Numbers Chapter 32

## Numbers 32:1
The tribes of Reuben and Gad had very large herds and flocks. They saw that the lands of Jazer and Gilead were suitable for livestock.

## Numbers 32:2
They came to Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the leaders of the congregation and said:

## Numbers 32:3
“The lands of Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon—

## Numbers 32:4
the land the Lord conquered before the community of Israel—are suitable for livestock, and your servants have livestock.

## Numbers 32:5
If we have found favour in your eyes, let this land be given to us as our inheritance. Do not make us cross the Jordan.”

## Numbers 32:6
Moses said, “Should your fellow Israelites go to war while you sit here?

## Numbers 32:7
Why do you discourage the people of Israel from going into the land the Lord has given them?

## Numbers 32:8
This is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to look at the land.

## Numbers 32:9
They went up to the Valley of Eshcol and discouraged the people from entering the land.

## Numbers 32:10
The Lord’s anger was kindled that day, and He swore:

## Numbers 32:11
‘None of the men who came out of Egypt, twenty years old or more, will see the land I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.’

## Numbers 32:12
‘Not one—except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun—for they followed the Lord fully.’

## Numbers 32:13
The Lord’s anger burned against Israel, and He made them wander forty years until the whole generation died.

## Numbers 32:14
Now you are behaving like your ancestors, a sinful brood, increasing the Lord’s wrath.

## Numbers 32:15
If you turn away from Him, He will again abandon the people in the wilderness, and you will be the cause of their destruction.”

## Numbers 32:16
Then they approached Moses and said, “Let us build sheepfolds here for our livestock and cities for our families.

## Numbers 32:17
But we ourselves will arm for battle and lead the Israelites across, until each has received their inheritance.

## Numbers 32:18
We will not return home until every Israelite has received their inheritance.

## Numbers 32:19
We will not claim land with them beyond the Jordan, for we have received our share on the east side.”

## Numbers 32:20
Then Moses said, “If you will do this—arm yourselves and go into battle before the Lord,

## Numbers 32:21
and if every one of you crosses the Jordan until the Lord has driven out His enemies—

## Numbers 32:22
then when the land is subdued before the Lord, you may return. You will have fulfilled your duty, and this land shall be yours before the Lord.

## Numbers 32:23
But if you fail to do this, you will have sinned against the Lord, and be sure your sin will find you out.

## Numbers 32:24
Build cities for your families and pens for your flocks, but do what you have promised.”

## Numbers 32:25
The Gadites and Reubenites said to Moses, “We will do as you command.

## Numbers 32:26
Our children and wives, flocks and herds will remain here.

## Numbers 32:27
But your servants, armed for battle, will cross over to fight before the Lord, as our lord says.”

## Numbers 32:28
Then Moses gave instructions concerning them to Eleazar, Joshua, and the leaders of the tribes.

## Numbers 32:29
He said, “If the Gadites and Reubenites cross the Jordan armed for battle, give them the land of Gilead.

## Numbers 32:30
But if they do not cross, they must accept land among you in Canaan.”

## Numbers 32:31
The Gadites and Reubenites answered, “We will do whatever the Lord has said.

## Numbers 32:32
We will cross into Canaan armed, before the Lord, and take possession of our inheritance afterward.”

## Numbers 32:33
So Moses gave to the tribes of Gad and Reuben and the half-tribe of Manasseh the kingdom of Sihon and Og—the land, cities, and surrounding territory.

## Numbers 32:34
The Gadites rebuilt Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer,

## Numbers 32:35
Atroth Shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah,

## Numbers 32:36
Beth Nimrah, and Beth Haran as fortified cities with pens for their flocks.

## Numbers 32:37
The Reubenites rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim,

## Numbers 32:38
Nebo, Baal Meon (names changed), and Sibmah. They gave new names to the cities they rebuilt.

## Numbers 32:39
The descendants of Machir son of Manasseh went to Gilead, captured it, and drove out the Amorites.

## Numbers 32:40
So Moses gave Gilead to Machir, and he settled there.

## Numbers 32:41
Jair, another descendant of Manasseh, captured villages and called them Havvoth Jair.

## Numbers 32:42
Nobah captured Kenath and its surrounding settlements and renamed it Nobah after himself.
