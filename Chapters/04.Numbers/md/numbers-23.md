# Numbers Chapter 23

## Numbers 23:1
Balaam said to Balak, “Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams.”

## Numbers 23:2
Balak did as Balaam requested, and they offered a bull and a ram on each altar.

## Numbers 23:3
Then Balaam said to Balak, “Stay here beside your offering while I go aside. Perhaps the Lord will come to meet with me, and I will tell you whatever He reveals.” So he went to a barren height.

## Numbers 23:4
God met with Balaam, and Balaam said, “I have prepared seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each.”

## Numbers 23:5
The Lord put a message in Balaam’s mouth and said, “Return to Balak and give him this word.”

## Numbers 23:6
So he returned to Balak, who was standing beside his offering with all the Moabite officials.

## Numbers 23:7
Then Balaam spoke his message:

## Numbers 23:8
> “Balak brought me from Aram,  
> the king of Moab from the eastern mountains.  
> ‘Come,’ he said, ‘curse Jacob for me;  
> come, denounce Israel.’

## Numbers 23:9
> But how can I curse those God has not cursed?  
> How can I denounce those the Lord has not denounced?

## Numbers 23:10
> From the rocky heights I see them,  
> from the hills I observe them—  
> a people living apart, not counting themselves among the nations.

## Numbers 23:11
> Who can count the dust of Jacob  
> or number even a fourth of Israel?  
> Let me die the death of the righteous,  
> and let my end be like theirs!”

## Numbers 23:11
Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies, but you have done nothing but bless them!”

## Numbers 23:12
Balaam answered, “Must I not speak what the Lord puts in my mouth?”

## Numbers 23:13
Then Balak said, “Come with me to another place where you can see them; you will only see part of them—not all—and from there you can curse them.”

## Numbers 23:14
So he took him to the field of Zophim on the top of Pisgah. There he built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each.

## Numbers 23:15
Balaam said, “Stay here beside your offering while I meet with the Lord over there.”

## Numbers 23:16
The Lord met with Balaam and put a message in his mouth and said, “Return to Balak and give him this word.”

## Numbers 23:17
So he went to him and found him standing beside his offering with the Moabite officials. Balak asked, “What did the Lord say?”

## Numbers 23:18
Then Balaam spoke his message:

## Numbers 23:19
> “Rise, Balak, and listen;  
> hear me, son of Zippor.

## Numbers 23:20
> God is not a man, that He should lie,  
> nor a human, that He should change His mind.  
> Does He speak and not act?  
> Does He promise and not fulfil?

## Numbers 23:21
> I have received a command to bless;  
> He has blessed, and I cannot change it.

## Numbers 23:22
> No misfortune is seen in Jacob,  
> no misery is observed in Israel.  
> The Lord their God is with them;  
> the shout of a king is among them.

## Numbers 23:23
> God brought them out of Egypt;  
> they have the strength of a wild ox.

## Numbers 23:24
> There is no divination against Jacob,  
> no evil omens against Israel.  
> It will now be said of Jacob and Israel,  
> ‘See what God has done!’

## Numbers 23:25
> The people rise like a lioness;  
> they rouse themselves like a lion.  
> They do not rest till they devour their prey  
> and drink the blood of their victims.”

## Numbers 23:26
Then Balak said to Balaam, “Neither curse them nor bless them at all!”

## Numbers 23:27
But Balaam answered, “Did I not tell you I must do whatever the Lord says?”

## Numbers 23:28
Then Balak said, “Come, I will take you to another place. Perhaps it will please God to let you curse them from there.”

## Numbers 23:29
And Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, overlooking the wasteland.

## Numbers 23:30
Balaam again had seven altars built and offered a bull and a ram on each.
