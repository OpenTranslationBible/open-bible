## Numbers 4:1
The Lord said to Moses and Aaron:

## Numbers 4:2
“Take a census of the Kohathite branch of the Levites by their clans and families.

## Numbers 4:3
Count all men from thirty to fifty years old who are able to serve in the tent of meeting.

## Numbers 4:4
This is the work of the Kohathites in caring for the most holy things:

## Numbers 4:5
When the camp is to move, Aaron and his sons are to go in and take down the shielding curtain and cover the ark of the covenant.

## Numbers 4:6
Then they are to cover it with hides and spread a cloth over it, and insert its poles.

## Numbers 4:7
They are to spread a blue cloth over the table of the Presence and put the plates, dishes, and bowls on it.

## Numbers 4:8
They are to spread a scarlet cloth over them and cover it all with durable leather.

## Numbers 4:9
They are to take a blue cloth and cover the lampstand and all its accessories.

## Numbers 4:10
They are to place everything on a carrying frame.

## Numbers 4:11
Over the gold altar they are to spread a blue cloth and cover it.

## Numbers 4:12
They are to take all the utensils and put them in a blue cloth, covering them with leather.

## Numbers 4:13
They are to remove the ashes from the bronze altar and spread a purple cloth over it.

## Numbers 4:14
Then they are to arrange all its utensils and spread a covering of leather and insert its poles.

## Numbers 4:15
After Aaron and his sons finish covering the holy furnishings, the Kohathites are to come and carry them, but they must not touch the holy things or they will die.

## Numbers 4:16
Eleazar son of Aaron is to be in charge of the oil, incense, and offerings.

## Numbers 4:17
The Lord said to Moses and Aaron:

## Numbers 4:18
“Do not let the Kohathite clans be destroyed from among the Levites.

## Numbers 4:19
This is how they are to enter and not die: Aaron and his sons must go in and assign each man his task.

## Numbers 4:20
But the Kohathites must not go in to look at the holy things, even for a moment, or they will die.

## Numbers 4:21
The Lord said to Moses:

## Numbers 4:22
“Take a census of the Gershonites by their clans and families.

## Numbers 4:23
Count all the men from thirty to fifty years old who can serve.

## Numbers 4:24
This is their service: to carry the curtains, coverings, and ropes.

## Numbers 4:25
They are to do all that needs to be done with these items.

## Numbers 4:26
They are to carry the curtains and equipment used in the tent of meeting.

## Numbers 4:27
Aaron and his sons shall assign them their tasks.

## Numbers 4:28
This is the service of the Gershonite clans.
