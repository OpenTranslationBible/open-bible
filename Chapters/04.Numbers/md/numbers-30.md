# Numbers Chapter 30

## Numbers 30:1
Moses said to the heads of the tribes of Israel: “This is what the Lord has commanded:

## Numbers 30:2
When a man makes a vow to the Lord or takes an oath to bind himself with a pledge, he must not break his word. He must do everything he said.

## Numbers 30:3
If a young woman, still living in her father’s house, makes a vow to the Lord or binds herself by a pledge,

## Numbers 30:4
and her father hears her vow but says nothing to her, then all her vows and pledges will stand.

## Numbers 30:5
But if her father forbids her on the day he hears about it, none of her vows or pledges will stand. The Lord will release her because her father has overruled her.

## Numbers 30:6
If she marries after making a vow or rash promise,

## Numbers 30:7
and her husband hears of it but says nothing to her, then her vows stand.

## Numbers 30:8
But if her husband cancels them on the day he hears of them, what she pledged will not stand, and the Lord will release her.

## Numbers 30:9
Any vow made by a widow or divorced woman is binding upon her.

## Numbers 30:10
If a woman living with her husband makes a vow or pledge,

## Numbers 30:11
and her husband hears it and remains silent, then all her vows will be valid.

## Numbers 30:12
But if her husband nullifies them when he hears them, then they are not binding. The Lord will release her.

## Numbers 30:13
Her husband may confirm or cancel any vow or oath she makes.

## Numbers 30:14
If he remains silent day after day, he confirms all her vows and pledges.

## Numbers 30:15
But if he cancels them later, he bears responsibility for her guilt.

## Numbers 30:16
These are the regulations the Lord gave Moses concerning a man and his wife, and between a father and his daughter while she is still living in his home.
