# Numbers Chapter 3

## Numbers 3:1
This is the account of Aaron and Moses at the time the Lord spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai.

## Numbers 3:2
These are the names of Aaron’s sons: Nadab the firstborn, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

## Numbers 3:3
They were anointed priests, ordained for service.

## Numbers 3:4
But Nadab and Abihu died before the Lord when they offered unauthorised fire. They had no children, so Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests under their father Aaron.

## Numbers 3:5
The Lord said to Moses,

## Numbers 3:6
“Bring the tribe of Levi and present them to Aaron to assist him.

## Numbers 3:7
They are to perform duties for him and the whole community at the tent of meeting by doing the work of the tabernacle.

## Numbers 3:8
They are to take care of all the furnishings and perform the duties for the Israelites.

## Numbers 3:9
Give the Levites to Aaron and his sons; they are given to him from among the Israelites.

## Numbers 3:10
Appoint Aaron and his sons to serve as priests, but anyone else who approaches the sanctuary must be put to death.”

## Numbers 3:11
The Lord also said to Moses,

## Numbers 3:12
“I have taken the Levites instead of the firstborn male offspring from every Israelite woman. The Levites belong to Me.

## Numbers 3:13
Every firstborn is Mine. When I struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, I set apart every firstborn in Israel for Myself—both people and animals.

## Numbers 3:14
The Lord said to Moses in the Desert of Sinai,

## Numbers 3:15
“Count the Levites by their clans and families, every male a month old or more.”

## Numbers 3:16
So Moses counted them, as the Lord commanded.

## Numbers 3:17
These were the names of the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

## Numbers 3:18
These were the names of the Gershonite clans: Libni and Shimei.

## Numbers 3:19
The Kohathite clans: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.

## Numbers 3:20
The Merarite clans: Mahli and Mushi.

## Numbers 3:21
To Gershon belonged the Libnite and Shimeite clans.

## Numbers 3:22
The number of all the males a month old or more was 7,500.

## Numbers 3:23
They were to camp on the west, behind the tabernacle.

## Numbers 3:24
The leader of the Gershonites was Eliasaph son of Lael.

## Numbers 3:25
They were responsible for the tabernacle, tent coverings, and curtains at the entrance.

## Numbers 3:26
Also the hangings of the courtyard and ropes.

## Numbers 3:27
To Kohath belonged the Amramite, Izharite, Hebronite, and Uzzielite clans.

## Numbers 3:28
The number of males a month old or more was 8,600.

## Numbers 3:29
They were to camp on the south side of the tabernacle.

## Numbers 3:30
Their leader was Elizaphan son of Uzziel.

## Numbers 3:31
They were responsible for the ark, table, lampstand, altars, and utensils of the sanctuary.

## Numbers 3:32
Eleazar son of Aaron was in charge of all those responsible for the sanctuary.

## Numbers 3:33
To Merari belonged the Mahlite and Mushite clans.

## Numbers 3:34
The number of males a month old or more was 6,200.

## Numbers 3:35
Their leader was Zuriel son of Abihail.

## Numbers 3:36
They were assigned to care for the frames, crossbars, posts, and bases of the tabernacle.

## Numbers 3:37
Also the posts around the courtyard and everything related to their use.

## Numbers 3:38
Moses, Aaron, and his sons were to camp to the east of the tabernacle.

## Numbers 3:39
The total number of Levites counted by Moses and Aaron was 22,000.

## Numbers 3:40
The Lord said to Moses: “Count all the firstborn Israelite males a month old or more and list them by name.

## Numbers 3:41
Take the Levites for Me instead of the firstborn, and the livestock of the Levites instead of all the firstborn animals.

## Numbers 3:42
So Moses counted all the firstborn of the Israelites,

## Numbers 3:43
and the number was 22,273.

## Numbers 3:44
The Lord said to Moses,

## Numbers 3:45
“Take the Levites instead of the firstborn, and the livestock of the Levites instead of theirs. The Levites are Mine.

## Numbers 3:46
To redeem the 273 firstborn who exceed the number of Levites,

## Numbers 3:47
collect five shekels for each person.

## Numbers 3:48
Give the money to Aaron and his sons.

## Numbers 3:49
So Moses collected the redemption money from those who exceeded the number of Levites.

## Numbers 3:50
He collected 1,365 shekels.

## Numbers 3:51
Moses gave the money to Aaron and his sons, as the Lord commanded.
