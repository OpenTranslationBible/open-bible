# Numbers Chapter 10

## Numbers 10:1
The Lord said to Moses,

## Numbers 10:2
“Make two trumpets of hammered silver. Use them for calling the community together and for giving the signal to move.

## Numbers 10:3
When both are sounded, the whole community is to gather at the entrance to the tent of meeting.

## Numbers 10:4
If only one is sounded, only the leaders are to assemble.

## Numbers 10:5
When a trumpet blast is sounded, the camps on the east are to set out.

## Numbers 10:6
At the second blast, the camps on the south are to set out.

## Numbers 10:7
To gather the assembly, blow the trumpets, but not with the same signal.

## Numbers 10:8
The sons of Aaron are to blow the trumpets. This is a lasting ordinance.

## Numbers 10:9
When you go to war in your land against an enemy, sound the trumpets. Then you will be remembered by the Lord and saved.

## Numbers 10:10
Also sound them at your feasts and festivals and over burnt offerings. They will serve as a reminder before God. I am the Lord your God.”

## Numbers 10:11
On the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year, the cloud lifted from above the tabernacle.

## Numbers 10:12
Then the Israelites set out from the Desert of Sinai, and the cloud came to rest in the Desert of Paran.

## Numbers 10:13
They set out in the order commanded by the Lord through Moses.

## Numbers 10:14
The division of Judah, under Nahshon son of Amminadab, set out first.

## Numbers 10:15
Next came Issachar, under Nethanel son of Zuar.

## Numbers 10:16
Then Zebulun, under Eliab son of Helon.

## Numbers 10:17
Then the tabernacle was taken down, and the Gershonites and Merarites set out, carrying it.

## Numbers 10:18
Next came Reuben, under Elizur son of Shedeur.

## Numbers 10:19
Then Simeon, under Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai.

## Numbers 10:20
Then Gad, under Eliasaph son of Deuel.

## Numbers 10:21
Then the Kohathites set out, carrying the holy things.

## Numbers 10:22
Then came Ephraim, under Elishama son of Ammihud.

## Numbers 10:23
Next Manasseh, under Gamaliel son of Pedahzur.

## Numbers 10:24
Then Benjamin, under Abidan son of Gideoni.

## Numbers 10:25
Last were Dan, under Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai.

## Numbers 10:26
Then Asher, under Pagiel son of Okran.

## Numbers 10:27
Finally Naphtali, under Ahira son of Enan.

## Numbers 10:28
This was the order of march for the Israelite divisions as they set out.

## Numbers 10:29
Moses said to Hobab, his Midianite relative, “We are setting out for the land the Lord promised. Come with us and we will treat you well.”

## Numbers 10:30
But Hobab replied, “I will not go; I am going back to my own land.”

## Numbers 10:31
But Moses said, “Please don’t leave us. You know where we should camp. You can be our guide.”

## Numbers 10:32
“If you come with us, we will share with you whatever good the Lord gives us.”

## Numbers 10:33
So they set out from the mountain of the Lord, and the ark of the covenant went ahead of them for three days.

## Numbers 10:34
The cloud of the Lord was over them by day when they set out.

## Numbers 10:35
Whenever the ark set out, Moses said, “Rise up, Lord! May Your enemies be scattered!”

## Numbers 10:36
And when it came to rest, he said, “Return, Lord, to the countless thousands of Israel.”
