# Numbers Chapter 15

## Numbers 15:1
The Lord said to Moses,

## Numbers 15:2
“Speak to the Israelites and say: When you enter the land I am giving you,

## Numbers 15:3
and you present an offering made by fire—whether a burnt offering, sacrifice to fulfil a vow, or a freewill or festival offering—

## Numbers 15:4
the one who brings the offering is also to bring a grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil.

## Numbers 15:5
With each lamb, bring a quarter of a hin of wine as a drink offering.

## Numbers 15:6
With a ram, bring two-tenths of an ephah of flour with a third of a hin of oil,

## Numbers 15:7
and a third of a hin of wine as a drink offering.

## Numbers 15:8
For a young bull, bring three-tenths of an ephah of flour with half a hin of oil

## Numbers 15:9
and half a hin of wine. This is a food offering, a pleasing aroma to the Lord.

## Numbers 15:10
This is to be done for each animal, whether bull, ram, or lamb.

## Numbers 15:11
Follow this pattern for each offering.

## Numbers 15:12
Do this for each one, however many you prepare.

## Numbers 15:13
Everyone native-born must do these things when bringing an offering.

## Numbers 15:14
And if a foreigner or anyone living among you wants to bring an offering, they must do the same.

## Numbers 15:15
The same law applies to both you and the foreigner.

## Numbers 15:16
The same rules and regulations apply for you and them.”

## Numbers 15:17
The Lord said to Moses,

## Numbers 15:18
“Speak to the Israelites and say: When you eat the food of the land,

## Numbers 15:19
present a portion as an offering to the Lord.

## Numbers 15:20
Present a loaf from the first of your ground meal as an offering.

## Numbers 15:21
Throughout the generations, give this offering from the first of your ground meal.

## Numbers 15:22
If you unintentionally fail to observe any command,

## Numbers 15:23
whether given directly or through Moses,

## Numbers 15:24
and the community becomes guilty, the whole assembly must offer a young bull as a burnt offering,

## Numbers 15:25
and a male goat as a sin offering. The priest makes atonement for the community, and they are forgiven.

## Numbers 15:26
The same applies to the foreigner living among them.

## Numbers 15:27
If an individual sins unintentionally, they must bring a year-old female goat.

## Numbers 15:28
The priest makes atonement, and they are forgiven.

## Numbers 15:29
The same law applies to both native-born and foreigners.

## Numbers 15:30
But anyone who sins defiantly, whether native-born or foreigner, blasphemes the Lord. They must be cut off.

## Numbers 15:31
Because they have despised the Lord’s word, they must bear their guilt.

## Numbers 15:32
While the Israelites were in the wilderness, a man was found gathering wood on the Sabbath.

## Numbers 15:33
He was brought to Moses and Aaron and held in custody, because it was not clear what should be done.

## Numbers 15:34
Then the Lord said to Moses,

## Numbers 15:35
“The man must die. The whole assembly must stone him outside the camp.”

## Numbers 15:36
So the assembly took him outside and stoned him, as the Lord commanded.

## Numbers 15:37
The Lord said to Moses,

## Numbers 15:38
“Speak to the Israelites and say: Throughout the generations, make tassels on the corners of your garments,

## Numbers 15:39
with a blue cord on each tassel. When you see them, you will remember all the commands of the Lord and obey them.

## Numbers 15:40
You will remember and follow My commands, not your own desires.

## Numbers 15:41
I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of Egypt to be your God. I am the Lord your God.”
