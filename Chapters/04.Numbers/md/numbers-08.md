# Numbers Chapter 8

## Numbers 8:1
The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

## Numbers 8:2
“Speak to Aaron and tell him: When you set up the seven lamps, they must light the area in front of the lampstand.”

## Numbers 8:3
Aaron did so; he arranged the lamps to face forward on the lampstand, as the Lord had commanded Moses.

## Numbers 8:4
This was how the lampstand was made: it was crafted from hammered gold, from its base to its flowers. It was made exactly according to the pattern the Lord had shown Moses.

## Numbers 8:5
The Lord spoke again to Moses:

## Numbers 8:6
“Take the Levites from among the Israelites and purify them for service.

## Numbers 8:7
To purify them, do this: sprinkle them with the water of purification, then have them shave their whole bodies and wash their clothes. This will make them ceremonially clean.

## Numbers 8:8
They are then to take a young bull with a grain offering of the finest flour mixed with oil, and you are to take a second young bull for a sin offering.

## Numbers 8:9
Bring the Levites to the front of the tent of meeting and assemble the whole Israelite community.

## Numbers 8:10
You shall present the Levites before the Lord, and the Israelites are to lay their hands on them.

## Numbers 8:11
Aaron is to present the Levites before the Lord as a wave offering from the Israelites, so that they may carry out the Lord’s work.

## Numbers 8:12
The Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls. Use one bull as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to the Lord to make atonement for the Levites.

## Numbers 8:13
You shall then have the Levites stand before Aaron and his sons and present them to the Lord as a wave offering.

## Numbers 8:14
In this way you are to set the Levites apart from the rest of the Israelites, and the Levites will be Mine.

## Numbers 8:15
After you have purified and presented them, the Levites are to come to do their work at the tent of meeting.

## Numbers 8:16
They are wholly given to Me from among the Israelites. I have taken them for Myself in place of all the firstborn from every womb among the Israelites.

## Numbers 8:17
Every firstborn among the Israelites is Mine, both man and animal. I set them apart for Myself on the day I struck down all the firstborn in Egypt.

## Numbers 8:18
I have taken the Levites in place of the firstborn of the Israelites.

## Numbers 8:19
I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and his sons from among the Israelites, to serve at the tent of meeting and to make atonement for them, so that no plague may strike the Israelites when they approach the sanctuary.”

## Numbers 8:20
Moses, Aaron, and the entire community of Israel did everything concerning the Levites exactly as the Lord had commanded Moses.

## Numbers 8:21
The Levites purified themselves and washed their clothes. Then Aaron presented them as a wave offering before the Lord and made atonement for them to cleanse them.

## Numbers 8:22
After that, the Levites came to perform their duties at the tent of meeting under Aaron and his sons. They did as the Lord commanded Moses.

## Numbers 8:23
The Lord said to Moses:

## Numbers 8:24
“This is what applies to the Levites: men twenty-five years old or more shall come to take part in the work at the tent of meeting.

## Numbers 8:25
But at the age of fifty, they must retire from regular service and may work no longer.

## Numbers 8:26
They may assist their brothers in performing their duties at the tent of meeting, but they must not do the work themselves. This, then, is how you are to assign responsibilities to the Levites.”
