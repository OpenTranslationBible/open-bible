# Numbers Chapter 21

## Numbers 21:1
When the Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev, heard that Israel was coming along the road to Atharim, he attacked them and took some of them captive.

## Numbers 21:2
Then Israel made a vow to the Lord: “If You will deliver these people into our hands, we will totally destroy their cities.”

## Numbers 21:3
The Lord listened to Israel’s plea and gave the Canaanites over to them. They completely destroyed them and their towns, so the place was named Hormah.

## Numbers 21:4
They traveled from Mount Hor along the route to the Red Sea to go around Edom. But the people grew impatient on the way.

## Numbers 21:5
They spoke against God and against Moses, saying, “Why have you brought us out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? There is no bread! There is no water! And we detest this miserable food!”

## Numbers 21:6
Then the Lord sent venomous snakes among them; they bit the people, and many Israelites died.

## Numbers 21:7
The people came to Moses and said, “We sinned when we spoke against the Lord and against you. Pray that the Lord will take the snakes away.” So Moses prayed for the people.

## Numbers 21:8
The Lord said to Moses, “Make a snake and put it up on a pole; anyone who is bitten can look at it and live.”

## Numbers 21:9
So Moses made a bronze snake and put it on a pole. Then when anyone was bitten by a snake and looked at the bronze snake, they lived.

## Numbers 21:10
The Israelites moved on and camped at Oboth.

## Numbers 21:11
Then they set out from Oboth and camped at Iye Abarim in the wilderness that faces Moab toward the sunrise.

## Numbers 21:12
From there they moved on and camped in the Zered Valley.

## Numbers 21:13
They set out from there and camped alongside the Arnon, which is in the wilderness extending into Amorite territory. The Arnon is the border between Moab and the Amorites.

## Numbers 21:14
That is why the Book of the Wars of the Lord says: “...Waheb in Suphah and the ravines of the Arnon,

## Numbers 21:15
and the slopes of the ravines that lead to the settlement of Ar and lie along the border of Moab.”

## Numbers 21:16
From there they continued on to Beer, the well where the Lord said to Moses, “Gather the people and I will give them water.”

## Numbers 21:17
Then Israel sang this song:

## Numbers 21:18
> “Spring up, O well! Sing about it,  
> about the well that the princes dug,  
> that the nobles of the people sank—  
> with sceptres and staffs.”  
Then they went from the wilderness to Mattanah,

## Numbers 21:19
from Mattanah to Nahaliel, from Nahaliel to Bamoth,

## Numbers 21:20
and from Bamoth to the valley in Moab where the top of Pisgah overlooks the wasteland.

## Numbers 21:21
Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites:

## Numbers 21:22
“Let us pass through your country. We will not turn aside into fields or vineyards, nor drink water from any well. We will travel along the King’s Highway until we have passed through your territory.”

## Numbers 21:23
But Sihon would not let Israel pass through his territory. He gathered his entire army and marched out into the wilderness to confront Israel. When he reached Jahaz, he fought with Israel.

## Numbers 21:24
Israel, however, put him to the sword and took over his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, up to the Ammonite border.

## Numbers 21:25
Israel captured all the cities of the Amorites and occupied them, including Heshbon and its surrounding settlements.

## Numbers 21:26
Heshbon had been the city of Sihon king of the Amorites, who had defeated the former king of Moab and taken all his land as far as the Arnon.

## Numbers 21:27
That is why the poets say: “Come to Heshbon and let it be rebuilt; let Sihon’s city be restored.

## Numbers 21:28
> Fire went out from Heshbon,  
> a blaze from the city of Sihon.  
> It consumed Ar of Moab,  
> the citizens of Arnon’s heights.

## Numbers 21:29
> Woe to you, Moab!  
> You are destroyed, people of Chemosh!  
> He gave up his sons as fugitives  
> and his daughters into captivity  
> to Sihon king of the Amorites.

## Numbers 21:30
> But we have overthrown them;  
> Heshbon’s dominion is gone as far as Dibon,  
> we have laid waste as far as Nophah,  
> which extends to Medeba.”

## Numbers 21:31
So Israel settled in the land of the Amorites.

## Numbers 21:32
Moses sent men to explore Jazer, and they captured its settlements and drove out the Amorites.

## Numbers 21:33
Then they turned and went up along the road toward Bashan, and Og king of Bashan and his whole army marched out to meet them at Edrei.

## Numbers 21:34
The Lord said to Moses, “Do not be afraid of him, for I have given him into your hands, along with his whole army and his land. Do to him what you did to Sihon.”

## Numbers 21:35
So they struck him down, along with his sons and his whole army, leaving no survivors. And they took possession of his land.
