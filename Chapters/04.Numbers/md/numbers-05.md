# Numbers Chapter 5

## Numbers 5:1
The Lord said to Moses,

## Numbers 5:2
“Command the Israelites to send away from the camp anyone who has a skin disease, a discharge, or has become ceremonially unclean by contact with a dead body.

## Numbers 5:3
Send away both male and female; send them outside the camp so they do not defile it, because I dwell among them.”

## Numbers 5:4
The Israelites did so; they sent them outside the camp as the Lord instructed Moses.

## Numbers 5:5
The Lord said to Moses,

## Numbers 5:6
“Say to the Israelites: Any man or woman who wrongs another is unfaithful to the Lord and is guilty.

## Numbers 5:7
They must confess their sin and make full restitution, adding a fifth of the value and giving it to the one they wronged.

## Numbers 5:8
If there is no relative to receive the restitution, it belongs to the Lord and goes to the priest, along with the ram of atonement.

## Numbers 5:9
All sacred contributions that the Israelites bring to a priest belong to him.

## Numbers 5:10
Gifts presented belong to the priest who receives them.

## Numbers 5:11
Then the Lord said to Moses,

## Numbers 5:12
“Speak to the Israelites and say: If a man’s wife goes astray and is unfaithful to him,

## Numbers 5:13
and another man has sexual relations with her without witnesses and she is not caught,

## Numbers 5:14
but the husband suspects her and is jealous,

## Numbers 5:15
he must bring his wife to the priest and offer a grain offering of jealousy—without oil or incense, because it is an offering for uncovering guilt.

## Numbers 5:16
The priest shall bring her forward and have her stand before the Lord.

## Numbers 5:17
He shall take holy water in a clay jar and put some dust from the tabernacle floor into the water.

## Numbers 5:18
He shall loosen her hair, place the offering in her hands, and hold the bitter water that brings a curse.

## Numbers 5:19
The priest shall make her swear an oath, saying: ‘If you have not defiled yourself, be free from this bitter water.’

## Numbers 5:20
‘But if you have gone astray and defiled yourself with another man,

## Numbers 5:21
may the Lord make you a curse among your people.’

## Numbers 5:22
‘May this water cause your abdomen to swell and your womb to miscarry.’ And the woman shall say, ‘Amen. So be it.’

## Numbers 5:23
The priest shall write these curses on a scroll and wash them off into the bitter water.

## Numbers 5:24
He shall make the woman drink the water, which brings bitterness and the curse.

## Numbers 5:25
The priest shall take the grain offering and wave it before the Lord.

## Numbers 5:26
Then he shall burn a portion of the offering on the altar.

## Numbers 5:27
If she is guilty, the water will bring pain and she will become a curse.

## Numbers 5:28
If she is innocent, she will remain unharmed and be able to bear children.

## Numbers 5:29
This is the law of jealousy when a woman goes astray or when a man is jealous.

## Numbers 5:30
The priest is to apply all these laws.

## Numbers 5:31
The man is innocent of wrongdoing, but the woman bears the consequences.
