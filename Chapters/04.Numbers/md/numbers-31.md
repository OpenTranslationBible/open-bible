# Numbers Chapter 31

## Numbers 31:1
The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:

## Numbers 31:2
“Take vengeance on the Midianites for the Israelites. Afterward, you will be gathered to your people.”

## Numbers 31:3
So Moses said to the people, “Arm some of your men for battle, that they may go against Midian to execute the Lord’s vengeance upon them.

## Numbers 31:4
Send into battle a thousand men from each of the tribes of Israel.”

## Numbers 31:5
So twelve thousand armed men were selected—one thousand from each tribe.

## Numbers 31:6
Moses sent them into battle, a thousand from each tribe, along with Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest, who took with him sacred articles and the trumpets for signaling.

## Numbers 31:7
They waged war against Midian, as the Lord commanded Moses, and killed all the men.

## Numbers 31:8
Among those they put to death were the five kings of Midian: Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba. They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword.

## Numbers 31:9
The Israelites took the Midianite women and children captive and seized all their livestock, flocks, and possessions.

## Numbers 31:10
They burned all the towns where the Midianites had settled, as well as all their camps.

## Numbers 31:11
They took all the plunder and spoils, including people and animals.

## Numbers 31:12
They brought the captives, plunder, and spoil to Moses and Eleazar the priest and the community of Israel at the camp on the plains of Moab near the Jordan, across from Jericho.

## Numbers 31:13
Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the community went out to meet them outside the camp.

## Numbers 31:14
Moses was angry with the officers of the army—the commanders of thousands and hundreds—who were returning from battle.

## Numbers 31:15
“Have you let all the women live?” he asked them.

## Numbers 31:16
“They were the ones who followed Balaam’s advice and caused the Israelites to trespass against the Lord at Peor. That’s why the plague came upon the Lord’s community.

## Numbers 31:17
Now kill all the boys and every woman who has slept with a man.

## Numbers 31:18
But spare for yourselves every girl who has never known a man intimately.

## Numbers 31:19
All of you who killed anyone or touched a dead body must stay outside the camp for seven days. Purify yourselves and your captives on the third and seventh days.

## Numbers 31:20
Purify every garment and article made of leather, goat hair, or wood.”

## Numbers 31:21
Then Eleazar the priest said to the soldiers who had gone into battle: “This is the law the Lord gave Moses.

## Numbers 31:22
Gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, and lead—

## Numbers 31:23
everything that can withstand fire—must be passed through the fire to be cleansed. But it must also be purified with the water of cleansing. Anything that cannot withstand fire must be purified with water.

## Numbers 31:24
On the seventh day, wash your clothes and you will be clean. Then you may come into the camp.”

## Numbers 31:25
The Lord said to Moses:

## Numbers 31:26
“You, Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the families are to count all the people and animals captured in the plunder.

## Numbers 31:27
Divide the spoils equally between the soldiers who fought and the rest of the community.

## Numbers 31:28
From the soldiers’ share, set aside a tribute to the Lord—one out of every five hundred people, cattle, donkeys, and sheep.

## Numbers 31:29
Give this tribute to Eleazar the priest as the Lord’s portion.

## Numbers 31:30
From the Israelites’ half, take one out of every fifty, and give it to the Levites who care for the tabernacle.”

## Numbers 31:31
So Moses and Eleazar did as the Lord commanded.

## Numbers 31:32
The plunder taken by the army included 675,000 sheep,

## Numbers 31:33
72,000 cattle,

## Numbers 31:34
61,000 donkeys,

## Numbers 31:35
and 32,000 women who had never been intimate with a man.

## Numbers 31:36
The half given to the soldiers was: 337,500 sheep—

## Numbers 31:37
with 675 as tribute to the Lord—

## Numbers 31:38
36,000 cattle—72 as tribute—

## Numbers 31:39
30,500 donkeys—61 as tribute—

## Numbers 31:40
and 16,000 women—32 as tribute.

## Numbers 31:41
Moses gave the tribute to Eleazar, as commanded.

## Numbers 31:42
The half given to the Israelites was also counted and distributed.

## Numbers 31:43
Moses took one out of every fifty and gave them to the Levites.

## Numbers 31:44
The officers of the army, the commanders, came to Moses

## Numbers 31:45
and said, “None of our men are missing.

## Numbers 31:46
So we have brought an offering to the Lord from what each man obtained: gold ornaments, bracelets, rings, earrings, and necklaces—to make atonement for ourselves.”

## Numbers 31:47
Moses and Eleazar received the gold and brought it to the tent of meeting as a memorial offering.
