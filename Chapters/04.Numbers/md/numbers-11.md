# Numbers Chapter 11

## Numbers 11:1
Now the people began to complain about their hardships, and the Lord heard it. His anger was kindled, and fire from the Lord burned among them.

## Numbers 11:2
When the people cried out to Moses, he prayed to the Lord and the fire died down.

## Numbers 11:3
So that place was named Taberah, because fire from the Lord had burned among them.

## Numbers 11:4
The mixed multitude among them craved other food. The Israelites also began to weep and said, “If only we had meat to eat!

## Numbers 11:5
We remember the fish we ate in Egypt at no cost—also the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic.

## Numbers 11:6
But now we have lost our appetite; we never see anything but this manna!”

## Numbers 11:7
The manna was like coriander seed and looked like resin.

## Numbers 11:8
The people went around gathering it. They ground it in handmills or crushed it in mortars, cooked it in a pot or made it into cakes. It tasted like something baked with olive oil.

## Numbers 11:9
When the dew fell on the camp at night, the manna also came down.

## Numbers 11:10
Moses heard the people of every family wailing at the entrance to their tents. The Lord became exceedingly angry, and Moses was troubled.

## Numbers 11:11
He asked the Lord, “Why have You brought this trouble on Your servant? What have I done to displease You that You put the burden of all these people on me?

## Numbers 11:12
Did I conceive all these people? Did I give them birth? Why do You tell me to carry them in my arms, as a nurse carries an infant, to the land You promised?

## Numbers 11:13
Where can I get meat for all these people? They keep wailing to me, ‘Give us meat to eat!’

## Numbers 11:14
I cannot carry all these people by myself; the burden is too heavy.

## Numbers 11:15
If this is how You are going to treat me, please go ahead and kill me—if I have found favour in Your eyes—and do not let me face my own ruin.”

## Numbers 11:16
The Lord said to Moses: “Bring Me seventy of Israel’s elders known to you as leaders. Have them come to the tent of meeting, so they may stand with you.

## Numbers 11:17
I will come down and speak with you there. I will take some of the Spirit that is on you and put it on them. They will help carry the burden.

## Numbers 11:18
Tell the people: ‘Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow you will eat meat. You have wailed, saying you were better off in Egypt. Now the Lord will give you meat.’

## Numbers 11:19
‘You will eat it not for one day, or two, or five, ten or twenty days,

## Numbers 11:20
but for a whole month—until it comes out of your nostrils and you loathe it—because you have rejected the Lord and wailed before Him.’

## Numbers 11:21
But Moses said, “Here I am among six hundred thousand men. Where can I get meat for them for a month?

## Numbers 11:22
Would flocks and herds be enough? Would all the fish in the sea suffice?”

## Numbers 11:23
The Lord answered, “Is the Lord’s arm too short? Now you will see whether or not My word will come true.”

## Numbers 11:24
So Moses went out and told the people what the Lord had said. He gathered seventy elders and had them stand around the tent.

## Numbers 11:25
Then the Lord came down in the cloud and spoke with him, taking some of the Spirit that was on Moses and putting it on the seventy elders. They prophesied, but did not do so again.

## Numbers 11:26
However, two men, Eldad and Medad, remained in the camp. The Spirit also came on them, and they prophesied in the camp.

## Numbers 11:27
A young man ran and told Moses, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp!”

## Numbers 11:28
Joshua son of Nun, who had been Moses’ assistant since youth, said, “Moses, my lord, stop them!”

## Numbers 11:29
But Moses replied, “Are you jealous for my sake? I wish all the Lord’s people were prophets!”

## Numbers 11:30
Then Moses and the elders returned to the camp.

## Numbers 11:31
Now a wind from the Lord drove in quail from the sea. They fell around the camp, about three feet deep in every direction as far as a day’s walk.

## Numbers 11:32
The people gathered quail all that day, night, and the next day. No one gathered less than ten homers. They spread them out all around the camp.

## Numbers 11:33
But while the meat was still between their teeth, before it could be consumed, the Lord’s anger burned, and He struck them with a severe plague.

## Numbers 11:34
So the place was named Kibroth Hattaavah, because there they buried the people who craved other food.

## Numbers 11:35
From Kibroth Hattaavah the people traveled to Hazeroth and stayed there.
