# Ezra Chapter 10

## Ezra 10:1

Now while Ezra was praying and making confession, weeping and prostrating himself before the house of God,  
a very large assembly of men, women, and children gathered to him from Israel;  
for the people wept bitterly.

## Ezra 10:2

And Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, responded and said to Ezra,  
“We have been unfaithful to our God, and have married foreign women from the peoples of the land;  
yet now there is hope for Israel in spite of this.

## Ezra 10:3

So now let us make a covenant with our God to send away all the wives and their children,  
in accordance with the counsel of my lord and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God;  
and let it be done according to the Law.

## Ezra 10:4

Arise! For this matter is your responsibility,  
but we will be with you; be courageous and act.”

## Ezra 10:5

Then Ezra stood and made the leading priests, the Levites, and all Israel take an oath  
that they would act in accordance with this proposal; so they took the oath.

## Ezra 10:6

Then Ezra got up from before the house of God and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib.  
Although he went there, he did not eat bread nor drink water,  
because he was mourning over the unfaithfulness of the exiles.

---

## Ezra 10:7

So they made a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem  
to all the exiles, that they were to assemble at Jerusalem,

## Ezra 10:8

and that whoever would not come within three days in accordance with the counsel of the leaders and the elders,  
all his possessions would be forfeited and he himself excluded from the assembly of the exiles.

---

## Ezra 10:9

So all the men of Judah and Benjamin assembled at Jerusalem within the three days.  
It was the ninth month on the twentieth day of the month,  
and all the people sat in the open square before the house of God,  
trembling because of this matter and the heavy rain.

## Ezra 10:10

Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them,  
“You have been unfaithful and have married foreign wives,  
adding to the guilt of Israel.

## Ezra 10:11

So now, make confession to the Lord God of your fathers and do His will;  
and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from the foreign wives.”

---

## Ezra 10:12

Then all the assembly replied with a loud voice,  
“It is our duty to do exactly as you have said!

## Ezra 10:13

However, there are many people, and it is the rainy season,  
and we are not able to stand in the open;  
nor can the task be done in one or two days, because we have transgressed greatly in this matter.

## Ezra 10:14

Let our leaders represent the entire assembly,  
and let all those in our cities who have married foreign wives come at appointed times,  
together with the elders and judges of each city,  
until the fierce anger of our God on account of this matter is turned away from us.”

## Ezra 10:15

Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah opposed this,  
with Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite supporting them.

## Ezra 10:16

But the exiles did so.  
And Ezra the priest selected men who were heads of fathers’ households for each of their fathers’ households,  
all of them by name.  
So they convened on the first day of the tenth month to investigate the matter.

## Ezra 10:17

And they finished investigating all the men who had married foreign wives by the first day of the first month.
