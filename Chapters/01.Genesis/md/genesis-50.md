# Genesis Chapter 50

## Genesis 50:1
Joseph threw himself on his father and wept over him and kissed him.

## Genesis 50:2
Then Joseph directed the physicians in his service to embalm his father Israel. So the physicians embalmed him.

## Genesis 50:3
They took forty days for the embalming, for that was the time required, and the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days.

## Genesis 50:4
When the days of mourning had passed, Joseph said to Pharaoh’s court, “If I have found favour in your eyes, speak to Pharaoh for me.

## Genesis 50:5
Tell him, ‘My father made me swear an oath and said, “I am about to die. Bury me in the tomb I dug for myself in the land of Canaan.” Now let me go up and bury my father; then I will return.’”

## Genesis 50:6
Pharaoh said, “Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear to do.”

## Genesis 50:7
So Joseph went up to bury his father. All Pharaoh’s officials accompanied him—the dignitaries of his court and all the dignitaries of Egypt—

## Genesis 50:8
besides all the members of Joseph’s household and his brothers and those belonging to his father’s household. Only their children and flocks and herds were left in Goshen.

## Genesis 50:9
Chariots and horsemen also went up with him. It was a very large company.

## Genesis 50:10
When they reached the threshing floor of Atad, near the Jordan, they lamented loudly and bitterly; there Joseph observed a seven-day mourning period for his father.

## Genesis 50:11
When the Canaanites who lived there saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, “The Egyptians are holding a solemn ceremony of mourning.” That is why the place was named Abel Mizraim.

## Genesis 50:12
So Jacob’s sons did as he had commanded them.

## Genesis 50:13
They carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre, the field Abraham had bought as a burial place.

## Genesis 50:14
After burying his father, Joseph returned to Egypt with his brothers and all who had gone with him.

## Genesis 50:15
When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “What if Joseph holds a grudge and pays us back for all the wrongs we did to him?”

## Genesis 50:16
So they sent word to Joseph, saying, “Your father left these instructions before he died:

## Genesis 50:17
‘This is what you are to say to Joseph: I ask you to forgive your brothers the sins and the wrongs they committed in treating you so badly.’ Now please forgive the sins of the servants of the God of your father.”

## Genesis 50:18
When their message came to him, Joseph wept. His brothers then came and threw themselves down before him. “We are your slaves,” they said.

## Genesis 50:19
But Joseph said to them, “Don’t be afraid. Am I in the place of God?

## Genesis 50:20
You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives.

## Genesis 50:21
So then, don’t be afraid. I will provide for you and your children.” And he reassured them and spoke kindly to them.

## Genesis 50:22
Joseph stayed in Egypt, along with all his father’s family. He lived 110 years.

## Genesis 50:23
He saw the third generation of Ephraim’s children, and also the children of Makir son of Manasseh, who were placed at birth on Joseph’s knees.

## Genesis 50:24
Then Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die. But God will surely come to your aid and take you up out of this land to the land He promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.”

## Genesis 50:25
And Joseph made the Israelites swear an oath and said, “God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones up from this place.”

## Genesis 50:26
So Joseph died at the age of 110. And after they embalmed him, he was placed in a coffin in Egypt.
