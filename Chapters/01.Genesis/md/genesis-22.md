# Genesis Chapter 22

## Genesis 22:1
Some time later God tested Abraham. He said to him, “Abraham!” And he replied, “Here I am.”

## Genesis 22:2
God said, “Take your son, your only son, whom you love—Isaac—and go to the region of Moriah. Offer him there as a burnt offering on a mountain I will show you.”

## Genesis 22:3
Early the next morning Abraham got up and loaded his donkey. He took with him two of his servants and his son Isaac. When he had cut enough wood for the burnt offering, he set out for the place God had told him about.

## Genesis 22:4
On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance.

## Genesis 22:5
He said to his servants, “Stay here with the donkey while I and the boy go over there. We will worship and then return to you.”

## Genesis 22:6
Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and placed it on his son Isaac, and he carried the fire and the knife. As the two of them went on together,

## Genesis 22:7
Isaac spoke up and said, “Father?” “Yes, my son?” Abraham replied. “The fire and wood are here,” Isaac said, “but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?”

## Genesis 22:8
Abraham answered, “God Himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.” And the two of them walked on together.

## Genesis 22:9
When they reached the place God had told him about, Abraham built an altar and arranged the wood on it. He bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar on top of the wood.

## Genesis 22:10
Then he reached out his hand and took the knife to slay his son.

## Genesis 22:11
But the angel of the Lord called out to him from heaven, “Abraham! Abraham!” “Here I am,” he replied.

## Genesis 22:12
“Do not lay a hand on the boy,” he said. “Do not do anything to him. Now I know that you fear God, because you have not withheld from Me your son, your only son.”

## Genesis 22:13
Abraham looked up and saw a ram caught by its horns in a thicket. He went over and took the ram and offered it as a burnt offering instead of his son.

## Genesis 22:14
So Abraham called that place The Lord Will Provide. And to this day it is said, “On the mountain of the Lord it will be provided.”

## Genesis 22:15
The angel of the Lord called to Abraham from heaven a second time

## Genesis 22:16
and said, “I swear by Myself, declares the Lord, that because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son,

## Genesis 22:17
I will surely bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will possess the gates of their enemies,

## Genesis 22:18
and through your offspring all nations on earth will be blessed, because you have obeyed Me.”

## Genesis 22:19
Then Abraham returned to his servants, and they set off together for Beersheba. And Abraham stayed in Beersheba.

## Genesis 22:20
Some time later Abraham was told, “Milcah has also borne children to your brother Nahor:

## Genesis 22:21
Uz the firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel (the father of Aram),

## Genesis 22:22
Kesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph and Bethuel.”

## Genesis 22:23
Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. Milcah bore these eight sons to Abraham’s brother Nahor.

## Genesis 22:24
His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also had sons: Tebah, Gaham, Tahash and Maakah.
