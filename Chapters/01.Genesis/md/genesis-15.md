# Genesis Chapter 15

## Genesis 15:1
After these events, the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision: “Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield; your reward will be very great.”

## Genesis 15:2
But Abram said, “Lord God, what can You give me, since I remain childless and the heir of my household is Eliezer of Damascus?”

## Genesis 15:3
And Abram said, “Look, You have given me no offspring, so a servant in my house will be my heir.”

## Genesis 15:4
Then the word of the Lord came to him: “This man will not be your heir, but one who comes from your own body will be your heir.”

## Genesis 15:5
God took him outside and said, “Look toward the heavens and count the stars—if you are able to count them.” Then He said, “So shall your offspring be.”

## Genesis 15:6
And Abram believed the Lord, and it was credited to him as righteousness.

## Genesis 15:7
He also said to him, “I am the Lord who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to possess.”

## Genesis 15:8
But Abram said, “Lord God, how can I know that I will possess it?”

## Genesis 15:9
He replied, “Bring Me a three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old female goat, a three-year-old ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.”

## Genesis 15:10
So Abram brought all of these to Him, split them in two, and laid each half opposite the other, but he did not cut the birds.

## Genesis 15:11
Birds of prey came down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away.

## Genesis 15:12
As the sun was going down, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and a terrifying darkness came over him.

## Genesis 15:13
Then the Lord said to Abram, “Know this for certain: your descendants will be strangers in a land not their own, where they will be enslaved and oppressed for four hundred years.

## Genesis 15:14
But I will judge the nation they serve, and afterward they will come out with great possessions.

## Genesis 15:15
You, however, will go to your ancestors in peace and be buried at a good old age.

## Genesis 15:16
In the fourth generation, they will return here, for the sin of the Amorites has not yet reached its full measure.”

## Genesis 15:17
When the sun had set and it was dark, a smoking firepot and a blazing torch appeared and passed between the divided pieces.

## Genesis 15:18
On that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram and said, “To your descendants I give this land, from the River of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates—

## Genesis 15:19
the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites,

## Genesis 15:20
Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites,

## Genesis 15:21
Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites, and Jebusites.”
