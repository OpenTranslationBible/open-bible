# Genesis Chapter 1

## Genesis 1:1
In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.

## Genesis 1:2
The earth was empty and without shape, with darkness covering the deep waters, and the Spirit of God was moving over the surface.

## Genesis 1:3
Then God said, "Let there be light," and light appeared.

## Genesis 1:4
God saw that the light was good, and He separated the light from the darkness.

## Genesis 1:5
God named the light 'day', and the darkness He named 'night'. There was evening, and there was morning—the first day.

## Genesis 1:6
God said, "Let there be a space between the waters to divide the water below from the water above."

## Genesis 1:7
So God made the expanse and separated the water under it from the water above. And it was so.

## Genesis 1:8
God called the expanse 'sky'. There was evening, and there was morning—the second day.

## Genesis 1:9
God said, "Let the waters under the sky be gathered together so that dry land may appear." And it happened.

## Genesis 1:10
God named the dry land 'earth', and the gathered waters He called 'seas'. And God saw that it was good.

## Genesis 1:11
Then God said, "Let the earth grow vegetation—seed-bearing plants and fruit trees, each producing according to their kind." And it was so.

## Genesis 1:12
The land produced plants bearing seed, and trees bearing fruit with seed in it, each by their kind. And God saw that it was good.

## Genesis 1:13
There was evening, and there was morning—the third day.

## Genesis 1:14
God said, "Let there be lights in the sky to separate day from night, and let them mark seasons, days, and years.

## Genesis 1:15
and let them shine upon the earth." And it was so.

## Genesis 1:16
God made two great lights—the greater to govern the day, the lesser to govern the night. He also made the stars.

## Genesis 1:17
God set them in the sky to shine on the earth,

## Genesis 1:18
to govern day and night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good.

## Genesis 1:19
There was evening, and there was morning—the fourth day.

## Genesis 1:20
God said, "Let the waters be filled with living creatures, and let birds fly across the sky above the earth."

## Genesis 1:21
So God created the great sea creatures and every kind of living being in the waters, and every kind of winged bird. And God saw that it was good.

## Genesis 1:22
Then God blessed them and said, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the seas; let the birds multiply on the earth."

## Genesis 1:23
There was evening, and there was morning—the fifth day.

## Genesis 1:24
God said, "Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds—livestock, crawling things, and wild animals." And it was so.

## Genesis 1:25
God made the wild animals, livestock, and every creature that moves along the ground, each according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.

## Genesis 1:26
Then God said, "Let Us make human beings in Our image, to be like Us. They will rule over the fish, the birds, the livestock, the whole earth, and all the creatures that move along the ground."

## Genesis 1:27
So God created humanity in His own image; in the image of God He created them—male and female He created them.

## Genesis 1:28
God blessed them and said, "Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish, the birds, and every living thing that moves on the earth."

## Genesis 1:29
Then God said, "Look, I give you every seed-bearing plant on the entire earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food.

## Genesis 1:30
And to all the animals and birds and everything that has breath, I give every green plant for food." And it was so.

## Genesis 1:31
God looked over everything He had made, and it was very good indeed. There was evening, and there was morning—the sixth day.
