Abraham took another wife, whose name was Keturah.

## Genesis 25:2
She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak and Shuah.

## Genesis 25:3
Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan. The descendants of Dedan were the Asshurites, the Letushites and the Leummites.

## Genesis 25:4
The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida and Eldaah. All these were descendants of Keturah.

## Genesis 25:5
Abraham gave all he owned to Isaac.

## Genesis 25:6
But while he was still living, he gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them away from his son Isaac to the land of the east.

## Genesis 25:7
Abraham lived a total of 175 years.

## Genesis 25:8
Then Abraham breathed his last and died at a good old age, an old man and full of years; and he was gathered to his people.

## Genesis 25:9
His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite,

## Genesis 25:10
the field Abraham had bought from the Hittites. There Abraham was buried with his wife Sarah.

## Genesis 25:11
After Abraham’s death, God blessed his son Isaac, who lived near Beer Lahai Roi.

## Genesis 25:12
This is the account of the family line of Abraham’s son Ishmael, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s servant, bore to Abraham.

## Genesis 25:13
These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, listed in the order of their birth: Nebaioth the firstborn, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,

## Genesis 25:14
Mishma, Dumah, Massa,

## Genesis 25:15

## Genesis 25:16
These were the sons of Ishmael, and these are the names of the twelve tribal rulers according to their settlements and camps.

## Genesis 25:17
Ishmael lived a total of 137 years. He breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people.

## Genesis 25:18
His descendants settled in the area from Havilah to Shur, near the eastern border of Egypt, as you go toward Ashur. And they lived in hostility toward all their relatives.

## Genesis 25:19
This is the account of the family line of Abraham’s son Isaac. Abraham became the father of Isaac,

## Genesis 25:20
and Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan Aram and sister of Laban.

## Genesis 25:21
Isaac prayed to the Lord on behalf of his wife, because she was childless. The Lord answered his prayer, and his wife Rebekah became pregnant.

## Genesis 25:22
The babies jostled each other within her, and she said, “Why is this happening to me?” So she went to inquire of the Lord.

## Genesis 25:23
The Lord said to her, “Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples will be separated from within you; one will be stronger than the other, and the older will serve the younger.”

## Genesis 25:24
When the time came for her to give birth, there were twin boys in her womb.

## Genesis 25:25
The first to come out was red, and his whole body was like a hairy garment; so they named him Esau.

## Genesis 25:26
After this, his brother came out, with his hand grasping Esau’s heel; so he was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when Rebekah gave birth to them.

## Genesis 25:27
The boys grew up, and Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the open country, while Jacob was content to stay at home among the tents.

## Genesis 25:28
Isaac, who had a taste for wild game, loved Esau, but Rebekah loved Jacob.

## Genesis 25:29
Once when Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came in from the open country, famished.

## Genesis 25:30
He said to Jacob, “Quick, let me have some of that red stew! I’m famished!” That is why he was also called Edom.

## Genesis 25:31
Jacob replied, “First sell me your birthright.”

## Genesis 25:32
“Look, I am about to die,” Esau said. “What good is the birthright to me?”

## Genesis 25:33
But Jacob said, “Swear to me first.” So he swore an oath to him, selling his birthright to Jacob.

## Genesis 25:34
Then Jacob gave Esau some bread and lentil stew. He ate and drank, and then got up and left. So Esau despised his birthright.
