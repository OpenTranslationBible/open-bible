# Genesis Chapter 21

## Genesis 21:1
Now the Lord was gracious to Sarah as He had said, and the Lord did for Sarah what He had promised.

## Genesis 21:2
Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the very time God had promised him.

## Genesis 21:3
Abraham gave the name Isaac to the son Sarah bore him.

## Genesis 21:4
When his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him, as God had commanded him.

## Genesis 21:5
Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.

## Genesis 21:6
Sarah said, “God has brought me laughter, and everyone who hears about this will laugh with me.”

## Genesis 21:7
And she added, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.”

## Genesis 21:8
The child grew and was weaned, and on the day Isaac was weaned Abraham held a great feast.

## Genesis 21:9
But Sarah saw that the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham was mocking,

## Genesis 21:10
and she said to Abraham, “Get rid of that slave woman and her son, for that woman’s son will never share in the inheritance with my son Isaac.”

## Genesis 21:11
The matter distressed Abraham greatly because it concerned his son.

## Genesis 21:12
But God said to him, “Do not be so distressed about the boy and your servant. Listen to whatever Sarah tells you, because it is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.

## Genesis 21:13
I will make the son of the servant into a nation also, because he is your offspring.”

## Genesis 21:14
Early the next morning Abraham took some food and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar. He set them on her shoulders and sent her off with the boy.

## Genesis 21:15
When the water in the skin was gone, she put the boy under one of the bushes.

## Genesis 21:16
Then she went off and sat down about a bowshot away, for she thought, “I cannot watch the boy die.” And she sat there, weeping.

## Genesis 21:17
God heard the boy crying, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said, “What is the matter, Hagar? Do not be afraid; God has heard the boy crying as he lies there.

## Genesis 21:18
Lift the boy up and take him by the hand, for I will make him into a great nation.”

## Genesis 21:19
Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water. So she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.

## Genesis 21:20
God was with the boy as he grew up. He lived in the desert and became an archer.

## Genesis 21:21
While he was living in the Desert of Paran, his mother got a wife for him from Egypt.

## Genesis 21:22
At that time Abimelek and Phicol the commander of his forces said to Abraham, “God is with you in everything you do.

## Genesis 21:23
Now swear to me here before God that you will not deal falsely with me or my descendants. Show to me and to the land where you have been living the same kindness I have shown you.”

## Genesis 21:24
Abraham said, “I swear it.”

## Genesis 21:25
Then Abraham complained to Abimelek about a well of water that Abimelek’s servants had seized.

## Genesis 21:26
But Abimelek said, “I don’t know who has done this. You did not tell me, and I heard about it only today.”

## Genesis 21:27
So Abraham brought sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelek, and the two men made a treaty.

## Genesis 21:28
Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs from the flock,

## Genesis 21:29
and Abimelek asked Abraham, “What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs you have set apart by themselves?”

## Genesis 21:30
He replied, “Accept these seven lambs from my hand as a witness that I dug this well.”

## Genesis 21:31
So that place was called Beersheba, because the two men swore an oath there.

## Genesis 21:32
After the treaty had been made at Beersheba, Abimelek and Phicol the commander of his forces returned to the land of the Philistines.

## Genesis 21:33
Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he called on the name of the Lord, the Eternal God.

## Genesis 21:34
And Abraham stayed in the land of the Philistines for a long time.
