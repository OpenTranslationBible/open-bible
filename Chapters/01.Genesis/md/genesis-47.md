# Genesis Chapter 47

## Genesis 47:1
Joseph went and told Pharaoh, “My father and brothers have arrived from Canaan with their flocks, herds, and everything they own, and are now in Goshen.”

## Genesis 47:2
He chose five of his brothers and presented them before Pharaoh.

## Genesis 47:3
Pharaoh asked the brothers, “What is your occupation?” “Your servants are shepherds,” they replied, “just as our ancestors were.”

## Genesis 47:4
They also said, “We have come to live temporarily in your land because the famine is severe in Canaan, and there is no pasture for our flocks. Please let your servants settle in Goshen.”

## Genesis 47:5
Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Your father and your brothers have come to you,

## Genesis 47:6
and the land of Egypt is before you; settle your father and your brothers in the best part of the land. Let them live in Goshen. And if any of them are especially capable, put them in charge of my livestock.”

## Genesis 47:7
Then Joseph brought his father Jacob in and presented him before Pharaoh. After Jacob blessed Pharaoh,

## Genesis 47:8
Pharaoh asked him, “How old are you?”

## Genesis 47:9
Jacob said, “The years of my pilgrimage are 130. Few and difficult have been the years of my life, and they do not equal the years of the pilgrimage of my fathers.”

## Genesis 47:10
Then Jacob blessed Pharaoh again and went out from his presence.

## Genesis 47:11
So Joseph settled his father and brothers in Egypt and gave them property in the best part of the land, the district of Rameses, as Pharaoh had directed.

## Genesis 47:12
Joseph also provided food for his father, his brothers, and all his father’s household, according to the number of their children.
