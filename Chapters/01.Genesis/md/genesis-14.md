# Genesis Chapter 14

## Genesis 14:1
At that time, Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Kedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goyim

## Genesis 14:2
went to war against Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboyim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar).

## Genesis 14:3
All these latter kings joined forces in the Valley of Siddim (the Salt Sea).

## Genesis 14:4
For twelve years they had been subject to Kedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled.

## Genesis 14:5
In the fourteenth year, Kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him defeated the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, the Zuzites in Ham, the Emites in Shaveh-kiriathaim,

## Genesis 14:6
and the Horites in their hill country of Seir, as far as El-paran near the desert.

## Genesis 14:7
Then they turned back and went to En-mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and they conquered the whole territory of the Amalekites, as well as the Amorites who were living in Hazazon-tamar.

## Genesis 14:8
Then the kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboyim, and Bela marched out and drew up their battle lines in the Valley of Siddim

## Genesis 14:9
against Kedorlaomer and his allies—four kings against five.

## Genesis 14:10
Now the Valley of Siddim was full of tar pits, and when the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some fell into them, and the rest fled to the hills.

## Genesis 14:11
The victorious kings seized all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their food; then they went away.

## Genesis 14:12
They also took Abram’s nephew Lot and his possessions, since he was living in Sodom.

## Genesis 14:13
A man who had escaped came and reported this to Abram the Hebrew. At that time, Abram was living near the great trees of Mamre the Amorite, a brother of Eshcol and Aner, all of whom were allies of Abram.

## Genesis 14:14
When Abram heard that his relative had been taken captive, he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and pursued the enemy as far as Dan.

## Genesis 14:15
During the night, Abram divided his forces against them, attacked, and routed them, pursuing them as far as Hobah, north of Damascus.

## Genesis 14:16
He recovered all the goods and brought back his relative Lot and his possessions, along with the women and the other people.

## Genesis 14:17
After Abram returned from defeating Kedorlaomer and the allied kings, the king of Sodom came out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King’s Valley).

## Genesis 14:18
Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was priest of God Most High.

## Genesis 14:19
And he blessed Abram and said, “Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth.

## Genesis 14:20
And blessed be God Most High, who delivered your enemies into your hand.” Then Abram gave him a tenth of everything.

## Genesis 14:21
The king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the people and keep the goods for yourself.”

## Genesis 14:22
But Abram replied, “I have raised my hand to the Lord, God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth,

## Genesis 14:23
that I will accept nothing belonging to you, not even a thread or a sandal strap, so that you can never say, ‘I made Abram rich.’

## Genesis 14:24
I will accept nothing but what my men have eaten and the share that belongs to the men who went with me—Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre. Let them have their share.”
