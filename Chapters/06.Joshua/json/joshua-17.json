      { "verse": 3, "text": "Now Zelophehad son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Makir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons but only daughters. Their names were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milkah, and Tirzah." },
      { "verse": 4, "text": "They approached Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the leaders, and said, “The Lord commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our relatives.” So Joshua gave them an inheritance among the uncles of their father, in accordance with the Lord’s command." },

      { "verse": 9, "text": "Then the boundary descended to the Kanah Ravine, south of the ravine. Towns belonging to Ephraim were among those of Manasseh, but the boundary of Manasseh was on the north side of the ravine and ended at the sea." },
      { "verse": 10, "text": "The land on the south belonged to Ephraim and that on the north to Manasseh. The sea was their boundary. They touched Asher on the north and Issachar on the east." },

      { "verse": 14, "text": "The descendants of Joseph said to Joshua, “Why have you given us only one allotment and one portion for an inheritance? We are a numerous people, and the Lord has blessed us greatly.”" },

      { "verse": 17, "text": "But Joshua said to the tribes of Joseph—to Ephraim and Manasseh—“You are numerous and very powerful. You will not have only one allotment." },
      { "verse": 18, "text": "The forested hill country will also be yours. Clear it, and its farthest limits will be yours. Although the Canaanites have chariots fitted with iron and though they are strong, you can drive them out.”" }
