      { "verse": 3, "text": "But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai," },
      { "verse": 4, "text": "they acted deceptively. They went and prepared provisions and loaded worn-out sacks on their donkeys, along with old wineskins that were cracked and mended." },
      { "verse": 5, "text": "They wore patched sandals on their feet and old garments on themselves. All the bread of their provisions was dry and mouldy." },
      { "verse": 6, "text": "Then they went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal and said to him and to the men of Israel, “We have come from a distant country. Make a treaty with us.”" },
      { "verse": 7, "text": "But the Israelites said to the Hivites, “Perhaps you live near us. How then can we make a treaty with you?”" },

      { "verse": 9, "text": "They answered, “Your servants have come from a very distant country because of the name of the Lord your God. For we have heard reports of Him and all that He did in Egypt," },
      { "verse": 10, "text": "and all that He did to the two kings of the Amorites east of the Jordan—Sihon king of Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth." },
      { "verse": 11, "text": "So our elders and all those living in our country said to us, ‘Take provisions for your journey. Go and meet them, and say, “We are your servants; make a treaty with us.”’" },
      { "verse": 12, "text": "Look at our bread. It was warm when we packed it at home on the day we left to come to you, but now see how dry and mouldy it is." },

      { "verse": 14, "text": "So the men of Israel sampled their provisions but did not seek the counsel of the Lord." },
      { "verse": 15, "text": "Then Joshua made a peace treaty with them to let them live, and the leaders of the congregation swore an oath to them." },
      { "verse": 16, "text": "Three days after they had made the treaty with them, the Israelites heard that they were neighbours living near them." },
      { "verse": 17, "text": "So the Israelites set out and reached their cities on the third day. Their cities were Gibeon, Kephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim." },
      { "verse": 18, "text": "But the Israelites did not attack them, because the leaders of the congregation had sworn an oath to them by the Lord, the God of Israel. So the whole assembly grumbled against the leaders." },

      { "verse": 21, "text": "They continued, “Let them live, but let them be woodcutters and water carriers for the whole congregation.” So the leaders kept their promise." },
      { "verse": 22, "text": "Then Joshua summoned the Gibeonites and said, “Why did you deceive us by saying, ‘We live far away from you,’ when in fact you live near us?" },
      { "verse": 23, "text": "Now therefore, you are under a curse. You will never be released from service as woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God.”" },
      { "verse": 24, "text": "They answered Joshua, “It was clearly told to your servants how the Lord your God had commanded His servant Moses to give you the whole land and to destroy all the inhabitants before you.
