# Joshua Chapter 15

## Joshua 15:1

The allotment for the tribe of Judah, according to its clans, extended southward to the boundary of Edom, to the Wilderness of Zin in the extreme south.

## Joshua 15:2

Their southern boundary began at the end of the Salt Sea,

## Joshua 15:3

crossed south of the Scorpion Ascent, continued to Zin, went up south of Kadesh Barnea, passed through Hezron, and went up to Addar and curved around to Karka.

## Joshua 15:4

It then passed to Azmon and joined the Wadi of Egypt, ending at the sea. This was their southern boundary.

## Joshua 15:5

The eastern boundary was the Salt Sea as far as the mouth of the Jordan.

The northern boundary started at the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan,

## Joshua 15:6

went up to Beth Hoglah and passed north of Beth Arabah, then went up to the Stone of Bohan son of Reuben.

## Joshua 15:7

The boundary then went up to Debir from the Valley of Achor and turned north toward Gilgal, facing the ascent of Adummim on the south side of the ravine. It continued to the waters of En Shemesh and ended at En Rogel.

## Joshua 15:8

Then it went up the Valley of Ben Hinnom along the southern slope of the Jebusite city (that is, Jerusalem). From there it climbed to the top of the hill west of the Hinnom Valley at the northern end of the Valley of Rephaim.

## Joshua 15:9

The boundary then turned from the top of the hill to the spring of the Waters of Nephtoah, went out to the towns of Mount Ephron, and turned toward Baalah (that is, Kiriath Jearim).

## Joshua 15:10

It then curved westward from Baalah to Mount Seir, passed along the northern slope of Mount Jearim (that is, Kesalon), went down to Beth Shemesh, and crossed to Timnah.

## Joshua 15:11

The boundary then proceeded to the slope of Ekron, turned toward Shikkeron, passed along to Mount Baalah, and reached Jabneel. The border ended at the sea.

## Joshua 15:12

The western boundary was the coastline of the Mediterranean Sea.  
These were the boundaries of the descendants of Judah, according to their clans.

## Joshua 15:13

In accordance with the Lord’s command to Joshua, he gave Caleb son of Jephunneh a portion in Judah—Kiriath Arba, that is, Hebron. (Arba was the forefather of Anak.)

## Joshua 15:14

From Hebron Caleb drove out the three Anakites—Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak.

## Joshua 15:15

From there he marched against the people living in Debir (formerly called Kiriath Sepher),

## Joshua 15:16

and Caleb said, “I will give my daughter Aksah in marriage to the man who attacks and captures Kiriath Sepher.”

## Joshua 15:17

Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s brother, captured it; so Caleb gave him his daughter Aksah in marriage.

## Joshua 15:18

When she came to him, she urged him to ask her father for a field. As she got down from her donkey, Caleb asked her, “What would you like?”

## Joshua 15:19

She replied, “Give me a blessing. Since you have given me land in the Negev, give me also springs of water.”  
So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs.
