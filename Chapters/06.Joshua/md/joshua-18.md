# Joshua Chapter 18

## Joshua 18:1

The whole assembly of the Israelites gathered at Shiloh and set up the tent of meeting there. The land was now under their control,

## Joshua 18:2

but there were still seven tribes of Israel who had not yet received their inheritance.

## Joshua 18:3

So Joshua said to the Israelites, “How long will you wait before you begin to take possession of the land that the Lord, the God of your ancestors, has given you?

## Joshua 18:4

Appoint three men from each tribe. I will send them out to survey the land and write a description of it, according to each inheritance, and then return to me.

## Joshua 18:5

You are to divide the land into seven portions. Judah is to remain in its territory in the south, and the house of Joseph is to remain in its territory in the north.

## Joshua 18:6

After you have written a description of the seven portions of land, bring it here to me and I will cast lots for you in the presence of the Lord our God.

## Joshua 18:7

The Levites, however, do not receive a portion among you, because the priestly service of the Lord is their inheritance. And Gad, Reuben, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have already received their inheritance east of the Jordan, given to them by Moses the servant of the Lord.”

## Joshua 18:8

As the men set out to map the land, Joshua instructed them, “Go and make a survey of the land and write a description of it. Then return to me, and I will cast lots for you here at Shiloh in the presence of the Lord.”

## Joshua 18:9

So the men went, travelled through the land, and wrote down in a book a description of it by towns in seven parts. Then they returned to Joshua in the camp at Shiloh.

## Joshua 18:10

Joshua cast lots for them at Shiloh in the presence of the Lord, and there he distributed the land to the Israelites according to their tribal divisions.

## Joshua 18:11

The lot came up for the tribe of Benjamin, according to its clans. Their allotted territory lay between the tribes of Judah and Joseph:

## Joshua 18:12

On the north side their boundary began at the Jordan, went up the northern slope of Jericho, proceeded westward into the hill country, and ended at the wilderness of Beth Aven.

## Joshua 18:13

From there it crossed to Luz (that is, Bethel), ran down to Ataroth Addar on the hill south of Lower Beth Horon.

## Joshua 18:14

From the hill facing Beth Horon on the south, the boundary curved southward along the western side and ran along the southern slope of Kiriath Baal (that is, Kiriath Jearim), a city of the people of Judah. This was the western boundary.

## Joshua 18:15

The southern boundary began at the outskirts of Kiriath Jearim and ran westward to the spring of the Waters of Nephtoah.

## Joshua 18:16

It went down to the foot of the hill facing the Valley of Ben Hinnom, north of the Valley of Rephaim. It continued down the Hinnom Valley along the southern slope of the Jebusite city and on to En Rogel.

## Joshua 18:17

It then curved north, went to En Shemesh, continued to Geliloth (which faces the ascent of Adummim), and went down to the Stone of Bohan son of Reuben.

## Joshua 18:18

It passed along to the northern slope of Beth Arabah and down into the Arabah.

## Joshua 18:19

The boundary continued to the northern slope of Beth Hoglah and ended at the northern bay of the Salt Sea, at the mouth of the Jordan. This was the southern boundary.

## Joshua 18:20

The Jordan formed the boundary on the eastern side.  
These were the boundaries of the inheritance of the tribe of Benjamin, according to its clans.
