# Joshua Chapter 22

## Joshua 22:1

Then Joshua summoned the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh

## Joshua 22:2

and said to them, “You have done all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded, and you have obeyed me in everything I commanded you.

## Joshua 22:3

For a long time now—to this very day—you have not deserted your fellow Israelites but have carried out the command of the Lord your God.

## Joshua 22:4

Now that the Lord your God has given rest to your fellow Israelites, as He promised, return to your homes in the land that Moses the servant of the Lord gave you on the other side of the Jordan.

## Joshua 22:5

But be very careful to observe the command and the law that Moses the servant of the Lord gave you: to love the Lord your God, to walk in all His ways, to obey His commands, to hold fast to Him, and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul.”

## Joshua 22:6

Then Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their homes.

---

## Joshua 22:7

(To the half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given land in Bashan, and to the other half Joshua gave land among their fellow Israelites west of the Jordan.)  
When Joshua sent them home, he blessed them,

## Joshua 22:8

saying, “Return to your homes with great wealth—with large herds of livestock, silver, gold, bronze and iron, and a great quantity of clothing. Share with your fellow Israelites the plunder from your enemies.”

---

## Joshua 22:9

So the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh left the Israelites at Shiloh in Canaan to return to Gilead, their own land, which they had acquired in accordance with the Lord’s command through Moses.

## Joshua 22:10

When they came to the region of the Jordan in Canaan, the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh built an imposing altar there by the Jordan.

---

## Joshua 22:11

When the Israelites heard that they had built the altar on the border of Canaan at Geliloth near the Jordan, on the Israelite side,

## Joshua 22:12

the whole assembly of Israel gathered at Shiloh to go to war against them.

---

## Joshua 22:13

So the Israelites sent Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest to the land of Gilead—to Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.

## Joshua 22:14

With him they sent ten chief men, one from each of the tribes of Israel, each the head of a family division among the Israelite clans.

---

## Joshua 22:15

When they went to Gilead—to Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh—they said to them:

## Joshua 22:16

“The whole assembly of the Lord says: How could you break faith with the God of Israel like this? How could you turn away from the Lord and build yourselves an altar in rebellion against Him now?

## Joshua 22:17

Was not the sin of Peor enough for us? Even to this day we have not cleansed ourselves from that sin, though a plague fell on the community of the Lord!

## Joshua 22:18

And now you are turning away from the Lord! If you rebel against the Lord today, tomorrow He will be angry with the whole community of Israel.

## Joshua 22:19

If the land you possess is defiled, come over to the Lord’s land, where the tabernacle of the Lord stands, and share the land with us. But do not rebel against the Lord or against us by building yourselves an altar other than the altar of the Lord our God.

## Joshua 22:20

When Achan son of Zerah was unfaithful in regard to the devoted things, did not wrath come on the whole community of Israel? He was not the only one who died for his sin.”

---

## Joshua 22:21

Then Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh replied to the heads of the Israelite clans:

## Joshua 22:22

“The Mighty One, God, the Lord! The Mighty One, God, the Lord! He knows! And let Israel know: If this has been in rebellion or disobedience to the Lord, do not spare us this day.

## Joshua 22:23

If we have built our own altar to turn away from the Lord or to offer burnt offerings or grain offerings or sacrifices, may the Lord Himself call us to account.

## Joshua 22:24

No! We did it for fear that in the future your descendants might say to ours, ‘What have you to do with the Lord, the God of Israel?

## Joshua 22:25

The Lord has made the Jordan a boundary between us and you—you Reubenites and Gadites! You have no share in the Lord.’ So your descendants might cause ours to stop fearing the Lord.

## Joshua 22:26

That is why we said, ‘Let us build an altar,’ not for burnt offerings or sacrifices,

## Joshua 22:27

but as a witness between us and you and the generations after us, that we will worship the Lord at His sanctuary with our burnt offerings, sacrifices, and fellowship offerings. Then in the future your descendants will not be able to say to ours, ‘You have no share in the Lord.’

## Joshua 22:28

And we said: If they ever say this to us or to our descendants, we will answer, ‘Look at the replica of the altar of the Lord which our ancestors built. It is not for burnt offerings and sacrifices, but as a witness between us and you.’

## Joshua 22:29

Far be it from us to rebel against the Lord and turn away from Him today by building an altar for burnt offerings, grain offerings and sacrifices—other than the altar of the Lord our God that stands before His tabernacle.”

---

## Joshua 22:30

When Phinehas the priest and the leaders heard what Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh had to say, they were pleased.

## Joshua 22:31

And Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest said to them, “Now we know that the Lord is with us, because you have not been unfaithful to Him in this matter. You have saved the Israelites from the Lord’s anger.”

---

## Joshua 22:32

Then Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest and the leaders returned to Canaan from their meeting with the Reubenites and Gadites in Gilead and reported to the Israelites.

## Joshua 22:33

The Israelites were glad to hear the report and praised God. They spoke no more of going to war against them to devastate the land where the Reubenites and Gadites lived.

---

## Joshua 22:34

And the Reubenites and Gadites gave the altar this name: A Witness Between Us—that the Lord is God.
