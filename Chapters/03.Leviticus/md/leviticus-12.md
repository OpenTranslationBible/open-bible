# Leviticus Chapter 12

## Leviticus 12:1
The Lord said to Moses:

## Leviticus 12:2
“Say to the Israelites: A woman who becomes pregnant and gives birth to a son will be ceremonially unclean for seven days, just as she is unclean during her monthly period.

## Leviticus 12:3
On the eighth day the boy is to be circumcised.

## Leviticus 12:4
Then the woman must wait thirty-three days to be purified from her bleeding. She must not touch anything sacred or go to the sanctuary until her purification is complete.

## Leviticus 12:5
If she gives birth to a daughter, she will be unclean for two weeks, as during her period, and must wait sixty-six days to be purified.

## Leviticus 12:6
When the days of her purification are over, whether for a son or a daughter, she is to bring a year-old lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or dove for a sin offering to the entrance of the tent of meeting.

## Leviticus 12:7
The priest is to offer them before the Lord to make atonement for her. Then she will be clean from her flow of blood. These are the regulations for a woman who gives birth to a boy or a girl.

## Leviticus 12:8
But if she cannot afford a lamb, she is to bring two doves or two young pigeons—one for a burnt offering and the other for a sin offering. In this way, the priest will make atonement for her, and she will be clean.
