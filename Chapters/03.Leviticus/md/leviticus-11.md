# Leviticus Chapter 11

## Leviticus 11:1
The Lord said to Moses and Aaron,

## Leviticus 11:2
“Say to the Israelites: These are the creatures you may eat among all the animals on the land:

## Leviticus 11:3
You may eat any animal that has a divided hoof and chews the cud.

## Leviticus 11:4
But you must not eat those that only chew the cud or only have a divided hoof. The camel, though it chews the cud, does not have a divided hoof—it is unclean for you.

## Leviticus 11:5
The hyrax, though it chews the cud, does not have a divided hoof—it is unclean for you.

## Leviticus 11:6
The rabbit, though it chews the cud, does not have a divided hoof—it is unclean for you.

## Leviticus 11:7
And the pig, though it has a divided hoof, does not chew the cud—it is unclean for you.

## Leviticus 11:8
You must not eat their meat or touch their carcasses; they are unclean for you.

## Leviticus 11:9
Of all the creatures living in the water, you may eat those with fins and scales.

## Leviticus 11:10
But anything that lives in the seas or streams that does not have fins and scales is to be regarded as unclean.

## Leviticus 11:11
You must regard them as unclean. Do not eat their meat and regard their carcasses as detestable.

## Leviticus 11:12
Anything in the water that does not have fins and scales is to be considered unclean for you.

## Leviticus 11:13
These are the birds you are to regard as unclean and must not eat because they are detestable: the eagle, the vulture, the black vulture,

## Leviticus 11:14
the red kite, any kind of black kite,

## Leviticus 11:15
any kind of raven,

## Leviticus 11:16
the horned owl, screech owl, gull, any kind of hawk,

## Leviticus 11:17
the little owl, cormorant, the great owl,

## Leviticus 11:18
the white owl, the desert owl, the osprey,

## Leviticus 11:19
the stork, any kind of heron, the hoopoe and the bat.

## Leviticus 11:20
All flying insects that walk on all fours are to be regarded as unclean.

## Leviticus 11:21
But you may eat certain winged insects that walk on all fours if they have jointed legs for hopping on the ground—such as locusts, katydids, crickets and grasshoppers.

## Leviticus 11:22
Of these you may eat: all kinds of locusts, katydids, crickets and grasshoppers.

## Leviticus 11:23
But all other winged insects that have four feet you are to regard as unclean.

## Leviticus 11:24
You will make yourselves unclean by these; whoever touches their carcasses will be unclean until evening.

## Leviticus 11:25
Whoever picks up one of their carcasses must wash their clothes and be unclean until evening.

## Leviticus 11:26
Every animal that does not have a divided hoof or does not chew the cud is unclean for you; whoever touches their carcasses will be unclean.

## Leviticus 11:27
All animals that walk on paws among those that move along the ground are unclean for you; whoever touches their carcasses will be unclean until evening.

## Leviticus 11:28
Anyone who picks up their carcasses must wash their clothes and be unclean until evening. These animals are unclean for you.

## Leviticus 11:29
Of the animals that move along the ground, these are unclean for you: the weasel, rat, and any kind of great lizard,

## Leviticus 11:30
the gecko, monitor lizard, wall lizard, skink and chameleon.

## Leviticus 11:31
These are unclean for you among all the creatures. Whoever touches them when they are dead will be unclean until evening.

## Leviticus 11:32
When one of them dies and falls on something, that article becomes unclean—whether it is wood, clothing, hide or sackcloth. Put it in water; it will be unclean until evening, then it will be clean.

## Leviticus 11:33
If one of them falls into a clay pot, everything in it will be unclean, and you must break the pot.

## Leviticus 11:34
Any food that could be eaten but has water from such a pot on it is unclean, and any liquid that could be drunk from it is unclean.

## Leviticus 11:35
Everything that one of their carcasses falls on becomes unclean. If it is an oven or cooking pot, it must be broken; it is unclean and will remain unclean.

## Leviticus 11:36
A spring or cistern for collecting water remains clean, but anyone who touches the carcass becomes unclean.

## Leviticus 11:37
If a carcass falls on seed intended for planting, it remains clean.

## Leviticus 11:38
But if water has been put on the seed and a carcass falls on it, it is unclean.

## Leviticus 11:39
If an animal you are allowed to eat dies, anyone who touches its carcass will be unclean until evening.

## Leviticus 11:40
Anyone who eats some of its carcass must wash their clothes and be unclean until evening. Anyone who picks up the carcass must do the same.

## Leviticus 11:41
Every creature that moves along the ground is detestable; it is not to be eaten.

## Leviticus 11:42
You must not eat any creature that moves along the ground—whether it moves on its belly or walks on all fours or on many feet.

## Leviticus 11:43
Do not defile yourselves by any of these creatures. Do not make yourselves unclean by them or be made unclean by them.

## Leviticus 11:44
I am the Lord your God; consecrate yourselves and be holy, because I am holy. Do not make yourselves unclean by any creature that moves along the ground.

## Leviticus 11:45
I am the Lord, who brought you up out of Egypt to be your God; therefore be holy, because I am holy.

## Leviticus 11:46
These are the regulations concerning animals, birds, every living thing that moves in the water and every creature that moves along the ground.

## Leviticus 11:47
You must distinguish between the unclean and the clean, between living creatures that may be eaten and those that may not be eaten.
