# Leviticus Chapter 8

## Leviticus 8:1
The Lord said to Moses:

## Leviticus 8:2
“Bring Aaron and his sons, their garments, the anointing oil, a bull for the sin offering, two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread.

## Leviticus 8:3
Assemble the whole community at the entrance to the tent of meeting.”

## Leviticus 8:4
Moses did as the Lord commanded, and the community gathered at the entrance.

## Leviticus 8:5
Moses said, “This is what the Lord has commanded to be done.”

## Leviticus 8:6
Then Moses brought Aaron and his sons forward and washed them with water.

## Leviticus 8:7
He put the tunic on Aaron, tied the sash around him, clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod on him. He fastened the woven waistband of the ephod around him.

## Leviticus 8:8
He placed the breastpiece on him and put the Urim and Thummim into it.

## Leviticus 8:9
He set the turban on Aaron’s head and placed the gold plate, the sacred emblem, on the front of the turban, as the Lord commanded.

## Leviticus 8:10
Then Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and everything in it, making them holy.

## Leviticus 8:11
He sprinkled some of the oil seven times on the altar, anointing the altar and its utensils, the basin and its stand, to consecrate them.

## Leviticus 8:12
He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head and anointed him to consecrate him.

## Leviticus 8:13
Then Moses brought Aaron’s sons forward, dressed them in tunics, tied sashes around them, and fastened caps on them, as the Lord commanded.

## Leviticus 8:14
He brought the bull for the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.

## Leviticus 8:15
Moses slaughtered the bull and took some of its blood. With his finger he put it on the horns of the altar to purify it, and poured out the rest at its base.

## Leviticus 8:16
He took all the fat around the internal organs, the long lobe of the liver, and the kidneys with their fat, and burned them on the altar.

## Leviticus 8:17
But the bull’s hide, flesh, and intestines he burned outside the camp, as the Lord commanded.

## Leviticus 8:18
Then he presented the ram for the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.

## Leviticus 8:19
Moses slaughtered the ram and splashed the blood against the sides of the altar.

## Leviticus 8:20
He cut the ram into pieces and burned the head, the pieces, and the fat.

## Leviticus 8:21
He washed the internal organs and legs with water and burned the whole ram on the altar as a pleasing aroma, a burnt offering to the Lord, as commanded.

## Leviticus 8:22
Then he presented the other ram—the ram for ordination—and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head.

## Leviticus 8:23
Moses slaughtered it, took some of its blood and put it on Aaron’s right ear, right thumb, and right big toe.

## Leviticus 8:24
He did the same to Aaron’s sons. Then he splashed the blood against the altar on all sides.

## Leviticus 8:25
He took the fat portions, the fat tail, the internal fat, the kidneys with their fat, the long lobe of the liver, and the right thigh.

## Leviticus 8:26
From the basket of unleavened bread before the Lord, he took one thick loaf, one loaf with oil, and one thin loaf, placing them on the fat and right thigh.

## Leviticus 8:27
He put all these in the hands of Aaron and his sons, who waved them before the Lord as a wave offering.

## Leviticus 8:28
Then Moses took them back and burned them on the altar on top of the burnt offering as an ordination offering—a pleasing aroma to the Lord.

## Leviticus 8:29
He also took the breast and waved it before the Lord. It was Moses’ share of the ordination ram, as commanded.

## Leviticus 8:30
Moses took some of the anointing oil and blood from the altar and sprinkled them on Aaron and his garments, and on his sons and their garments. So they were consecrated.

## Leviticus 8:31
Moses said to Aaron and his sons, “Boil the meat at the entrance to the tent and eat it with the bread from the basket of ordination offerings, as commanded.”

## Leviticus 8:32
“Burn any leftover meat and bread.”

## Leviticus 8:33
“Do not leave the entrance of the tent for seven days, until your ordination days are complete, because it takes seven days to ordain you.”

## Leviticus 8:34
“What has been done today was commanded by the Lord to make atonement for you.”

## Leviticus 8:35
“Stay at the entrance day and night for seven days. Do not leave until the time is completed, or you will die, for this is what the Lord has commanded.”

## Leviticus 8:36
So Aaron and his sons did everything the Lord commanded through Moses.
