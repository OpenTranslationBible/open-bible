# Leviticus Chapter 2

## Leviticus 2:1
When anyone brings a grain offering to the Lord, their offering is to be of the finest flour. They must pour oil on it, put incense on it,

## Leviticus 2:2
and take it to Aaron’s sons the priests. The priest shall take a handful of the flour and oil, together with all the incense, and burn this as a memorial portion on the altar—a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the Lord.

## Leviticus 2:3
The rest of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and his sons. It is a most holy part of the food offerings presented to the Lord.

## Leviticus 2:4
If you bring a grain offering baked in an oven, it is to consist of either thick loaves made without yeast and mixed with oil, or thin loaves without yeast brushed with oil.

## Leviticus 2:5
If your grain offering is prepared on a griddle, it must be made of the finest flour mixed with oil and without yeast.

Break it into pieces and pour oil on it; it is a grain offering.

## Leviticus 2:9
He shall take out the memorial portion and burn it on the altar as a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the Lord.

## Leviticus 2:10
The rest of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and his sons. It is a most holy part of the food offerings to the Lord.

## Leviticus 2:11
Every grain offering you bring to the Lord must be made without yeast, for you must not burn any yeast or honey in a food offering presented to the Lord.

## Leviticus 2:12
You may bring them to the Lord as an offering of firstfruits, but they are not to be offered on the altar as a pleasing aroma.

## Leviticus 2:13
Season all your grain offerings with salt. Do not leave the salt of the covenant of your God out of your grain offerings; add salt to all your offerings.

If you bring a grain offering of firstfruits to the Lord, offer crushed heads of new grain roasted in the fire.

Put oil and incense on it; it is a grain offering.

The priest shall burn the memorial portion of the crushed grain and the oil, together with all the incense, as a food offering to the Lord.
