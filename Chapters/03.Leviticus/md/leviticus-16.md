# Leviticus Chapter 16

## Leviticus 16:1
The Lord spoke to Moses after the death of Aaron’s two sons, who died when they approached the Lord.

## Leviticus 16:2
The Lord said to Moses: “Tell your brother Aaron not to come whenever he chooses into the Most Holy Place behind the curtain before the atonement cover on the ark, or he will die, because I appear in the cloud over the cover.

## Leviticus 16:3
This is how Aaron is to enter the sanctuary: with a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering.

## Leviticus 16:4
He is to put on the sacred linen tunic, linen undergarments, and the sash, and wrap himself with the linen turban—these are sacred garments. He must bathe with water before putting them on.

## Leviticus 16:5
From the Israelite community he is to take two male goats for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering.

## Leviticus 16:6
Aaron is to offer the bull for his own sin offering to make atonement for himself and his household.

## Leviticus 16:7
Then he is to take the two goats and present them before the Lord at the entrance to the tent of meeting.

## Leviticus 16:8
He is to cast lots for the two goats—one lot for the Lord and the other for the scapegoat.

## Leviticus 16:9
Aaron shall sacrifice the goat chosen for the Lord as a sin offering.

## Leviticus 16:10
But the goat chosen as the scapegoat shall be presented alive before the Lord to be used for making atonement by sending it into the wilderness.

## Leviticus 16:11
Aaron shall bring the bull for his own sin offering to make atonement for himself and his household, and slaughter it.

## Leviticus 16:12
He is to take a censer full of burning coals and two handfuls of fragrant incense and bring them inside the curtain.

## Leviticus 16:13
He is to put the incense on the fire before the Lord, and the cloud of incense will cover the atonement cover so that he will not die.

## Leviticus 16:14
He is to take some blood of the bull and sprinkle it with his finger on the front of the atonement cover and seven times before it.

## Leviticus 16:15
Then he shall slaughter the goat for the people’s sin offering and do the same with its blood.

## Leviticus 16:16
In this way he will make atonement for the Most Holy Place, cleansing it from the uncleanness of the Israelites.

## Leviticus 16:17
No one is to be in the tent of meeting while he makes atonement, until he comes out and has made atonement for himself, his household, and the entire assembly.

## Leviticus 16:18
Then he shall come out and make atonement for the altar, using the blood of the bull and the goat.

## Leviticus 16:19
He shall sprinkle it seven times to cleanse and consecrate it.

## Leviticus 16:20
When he has finished making atonement, he shall bring forward the live goat.

## Leviticus 16:21
He is to lay both hands on its head and confess over it all the sins of the Israelites, then send the goat away into the wilderness.

## Leviticus 16:22
The goat will carry on itself all their sins to a remote place, and the man shall release it.

## Leviticus 16:23
Aaron is to go into the tent of meeting, remove the linen garments, and leave them there.

## Leviticus 16:24
He shall bathe in the sanctuary area and put on his regular garments before coming out to offer the burnt offerings.

## Leviticus 16:25
He shall burn the fat of the sin offering on the altar.

## Leviticus 16:26
The man who released the goat must wash his clothes and bathe with water.

## Leviticus 16:27
The bull and goat for the sin offerings must be taken outside the camp and burned.

## Leviticus 16:28
The person who burns them must also wash his clothes and bathe.

## Leviticus 16:29
This is a lasting ordinance: on the tenth day of the seventh month, you must deny yourselves and not do any work.

## Leviticus 16:30
On this day, atonement will be made for you to cleanse you from all your sins.

## Leviticus 16:31
It is a day of sabbath rest, and you must deny yourselves. It is a lasting ordinance.

## Leviticus 16:32
The priest who is anointed and ordained shall make atonement.

## Leviticus 16:33
He shall make atonement for the sanctuary, the tent of meeting, the altar, the priests, and the people.

## Leviticus 16:34
This is to be a lasting ordinance. Atonement is to be made once a year for all the sins of the Israelites.
