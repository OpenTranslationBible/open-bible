# Leviticus Chapter 4

## Leviticus 4:1
The Lord said to Moses,

## Leviticus 4:2
“Say to the Israelites: If anyone sins unintentionally and does what is forbidden in any of the Lord’s commands—

## Leviticus 4:3
If the anointed priest sins, bringing guilt on the people, he must bring to the Lord a young bull without defect as a sin offering for the sin he has committed.

## Leviticus 4:4
He is to bring the bull to the entrance of the tent of meeting before the Lord, lay his hand on its head and slaughter it before the Lord.

## Leviticus 4:5
Then the anointed priest shall take some of the bull’s blood and carry it into the tent of meeting.

## Leviticus 4:6
He is to dip his finger into the blood and sprinkle it seven times before the Lord, in front of the curtain of the sanctuary.

## Leviticus 4:7
The priest shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of fragrant incense before the Lord in the tent of meeting. The rest of the blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering at the entrance to the tent.

## Leviticus 4:8
He must remove all the fat from the bull of the sin offering—the fat that covers the internal organs and all the fat connected to them,

## Leviticus 4:9
both kidneys with the fat on them, and the long lobe of the liver, which he will remove with the kidneys—

## Leviticus 4:10
just as the fat is removed from the ox of the fellowship offering. Then the priest shall burn them on the altar of burnt offering.

## Leviticus 4:11
But the hide of the bull, all its flesh, its head, legs, internal organs and intestines—

## Leviticus 4:12
that is, the rest of the bull—he must take outside the camp to a ceremonially clean place where the ashes are dumped, and burn it on a wood fire on the ash heap.

## Leviticus 4:13
If the whole Israelite community sins unintentionally and does what is forbidden in any of the Lord’s commands, even though the community is unaware, they are guilty.

## Leviticus 4:14
When they become aware of the sin they committed, the assembly must bring a young bull as a sin offering and present it before the tent of meeting.

## Leviticus 4:15
The elders of the community are to lay their hands on the bull’s head before the Lord, and it shall be slaughtered before the Lord.

## Leviticus 4:16
Then the anointed priest is to take some of the bull’s blood into the tent of meeting.

## Leviticus 4:17
He shall dip his finger into the blood and sprinkle it seven times before the Lord in front of the curtain.

## Leviticus 4:18
He shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar before the Lord in the tent of meeting. The rest he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering at the entrance to the tent.

## Leviticus 4:19
He shall remove all the fat from it and burn it on the altar,

## Leviticus 4:20
and do with this bull just as he did with the first bull of the sin offering. In this way the priest will make atonement for the community, and they will be forgiven.

## Leviticus 4:21
Then he shall take the bull outside the camp and burn it as he burned the first bull. This is the sin offering for the assembly.

## Leviticus 4:22
When a leader sins unintentionally and does something forbidden in any of the commands of the Lord his God, he is guilty.

## Leviticus 4:23
When he becomes aware of the sin, he must bring a male goat without defect.

## Leviticus 4:24
He is to lay his hand on the goat’s head and slaughter it at the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered.

## Leviticus 4:25
Then the priest shall take some of the blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering. The rest he shall pour out at the base of the altar.

## Leviticus 4:26
He shall burn all the fat on the altar as he did with the fellowship offering. In this way the priest will make atonement for the leader’s sin, and he will be forgiven.

## Leviticus 4:27
If any member of the community sins unintentionally and does what is forbidden in any of the Lord’s commands, they are guilty.

## Leviticus 4:28
When they become aware of the sin, they must bring a female goat without defect.

## Leviticus 4:29
They are to lay their hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter it at the place of the burnt offering.

## Leviticus 4:30
Then the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar. The rest he shall pour out at the base of the altar.

## Leviticus 4:31
They shall remove all the fat and burn it on the altar. In this way the priest will make atonement, and they will be forgiven.

## Leviticus 4:32
If someone brings a lamb as their sin offering, it must be a female without defect.

## Leviticus 4:33
They are to lay their hand on its head and slaughter it for a sin offering at the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered.

## Leviticus 4:34
Then the priest shall take some of the blood with his finger, put it on the horns of the altar, and pour out the rest at the base.

## Leviticus 4:35
They shall remove all the fat, just as with the fellowship offering, and the priest shall burn it on the altar. In this way the priest will make atonement for them, and they will be forgiven.
