# Leviticus Chapter 6

## Leviticus 6:1
The Lord said to Moses:

## Leviticus 6:2
“If anyone sins and acts unfaithfully against the Lord by deceiving a neighbour about something entrusted to them or left in their care, or by theft or extortion,

## Leviticus 6:3
or if they find lost property and lie about it, or if they swear falsely about any such sin people may commit—

## Leviticus 6:4
when they become guilty, they must return what they have stolen or taken by extortion, or what was entrusted to them, or the lost property they found,

## Leviticus 6:5
or whatever it was they swore falsely about. They must make restitution in full, add a fifth of its value, and give it all to the owner on the day they present their guilt offering.

## Leviticus 6:6
Then they must bring to the priest, as a guilt offering to the Lord, a ram without defect and of proper value.

## Leviticus 6:7
In this way the priest will make atonement before the Lord, and they will be forgiven for any of these things they did that made them guilty.

## Leviticus 6:8
The Lord said to Moses:

## Leviticus 6:9
“Command Aaron and his sons: These are the regulations for the burnt offering: The burnt offering is to remain on the altar hearth all night until morning, and the fire must be kept burning on the altar.

## Leviticus 6:10
The priest shall put on his linen garments and linen undergarments, and remove the ashes from the burnt offering consumed by the fire, placing them beside the altar.

## Leviticus 6:11
Then he is to take off those garments, put on others, and carry the ashes outside the camp to a ceremonially clean place.

## Leviticus 6:12
The fire must be kept burning on the altar continuously; it must not go out. Each morning the priest shall add firewood, arrange the burnt offering on it, and burn the fat of the fellowship offerings on it.

## Leviticus 6:13
The fire must be kept burning on the altar at all times; it must never go out.

## Leviticus 6:14
These are the regulations for the grain offering: Aaron’s sons are to present it before the Lord, in front of the altar.

## Leviticus 6:14
“These are the instructions for the grain offering: Aaron’s sons are to bring it before the Lord, in front of the altar.

## Leviticus 6:15
The priest shall take a handful of the finest flour from the grain offering, mixed with oil and all the incense on it, and burn it as a memorial portion on the altar as a pleasing aroma to the Lord.

## Leviticus 6:16
Aaron and his sons shall eat the rest, but it must be eaten without yeast in a holy place—in the courtyard of the tent of meeting.

## Leviticus 6:17
It must not be baked with yeast; I have given it as their share of My food offerings. It is most holy, like the sin offering and the guilt offering.

## Leviticus 6:18
Any male descendant of Aaron may eat it. It is a lasting ordinance for generations. Anything that touches these offerings will become holy.”

## Leviticus 6:19
The Lord said to Moses:

## Leviticus 6:20
“This is the offering Aaron and his sons are to bring to the Lord on the day he is anointed: a tenth of an ephah of the finest flour as a regular grain offering, half in the morning and half in the evening.

## Leviticus 6:21
Prepare it with oil on a griddle; bring it well mixed and present the grain offering in baked pieces as a pleasing aroma to the Lord.

## Leviticus 6:22
The son who succeeds him as priest shall prepare it; it is the Lord’s and is to be burned completely.

## Leviticus 6:23
Every grain offering of a priest shall be burned completely; it must not be eaten.”

## Leviticus 6:24
The Lord said to Moses:

## Leviticus 6:25
“Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying: These are the instructions for the sin offering. The sin offering must be slaughtered before the Lord in the same place as the burnt offering—it is most holy.

## Leviticus 6:26
The priest who offers it shall eat it; it must be eaten in the sanctuary courtyard, in a holy place.

## Leviticus 6:27
Whatever touches the flesh of the offering will become holy. If any of its blood is splashed on a garment, you must wash it in a holy place.

## Leviticus 6:28
The clay pot in which the offering is cooked must be broken. If it is cooked in a bronze pot, it must be scoured and rinsed with water.

## Leviticus 6:29
Any male in a priest’s family may eat it; it is most holy.

## Leviticus 6:30
But any sin offering whose blood is brought into the tent of meeting to make atonement in the Holy Place must not be eaten; it must be burned.
