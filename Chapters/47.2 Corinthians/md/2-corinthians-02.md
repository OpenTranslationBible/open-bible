# 2 Corinthians Chapter 2

## 2 Corinthians 2:1

But I decided this for my own sake, that I would not come to you in sorrow again.

## 2 Corinthians 2:2

For if I cause you sorrow, who then will be the one making me glad but the one who is made sorrowful by me?

## 2 Corinthians 2:3

This is the very thing I wrote you, so that when I came, I would not have sorrow from those who ought to make me rejoice; having confidence in you all that my joy would be the joy of you all.

## 2 Corinthians 2:4

For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears; not so that you would be made sorrowful, but that you might know the love which I have especially for you.

## 2 Corinthians 2:5

But if anyone has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow not for me, but in some degree—not to say too much—for all of you.

## 2 Corinthians 2:6

Sufficient for such a person is this punishment which was imposed by the majority,

## 2 Corinthians 2:7

So that on the contrary you should rather forgive and comfort him, otherwise such a person might be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.

## 2 Corinthians 2:8

Therefore I urge you to reaffirm your love for him.

## 2 Corinthians 2:9

For to this end I also wrote, so that I might put you to the test, whether you are obedient in all things.

## 2 Corinthians 2:10

But one whom you forgive anything, I also forgive; for indeed what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, I did so for your sakes in the presence of Christ,

## 2 Corinthians 2:11

So that no advantage would be taken of us by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his schemes.

## 2 Corinthians 2:12

Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ and when a door was opened for me in the Lord,

## 2 Corinthians 2:13

I had no rest for my spirit, not finding Titus my brother; but saying goodbye to them, I went on to Macedonia.

## 2 Corinthians 2:14

But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and through us reveals the fragrance of the knowledge of Him in every place.

## 2 Corinthians 2:15

For we are a fragrance of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing:

## 2 Corinthians 2:16

To the one an aroma from death to death, to the other an aroma from life to life. And who is adequate for these things?

## 2 Corinthians 2:17

For we are not like the many, peddling the word of God, but as from sincerity, but as from God, we speak in Christ in the sight of God.
