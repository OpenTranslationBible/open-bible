# 2 Thessalonians Chapter 3

## 2 Thessalonians 3:1

Finally, brothers and sisters, pray for us that the word of the Lord will spread rapidly and be glorified, just as it was also with you;

## 2 Thessalonians 3:2

and that we will be rescued from perverse and evil people; for not all have faith.

## 2 Thessalonians 3:3

But the Lord is faithful, and He will strengthen and protect you from the evil one.

## 2 Thessalonians 3:4

We have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you are doing, and will continue to do, what we command.

## 2 Thessalonians 3:5

May the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God and to the perseverance of Christ.

## 2 Thessalonians 3:6

Now we command you, brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you keep away from every brother or sister who leads a disorderly life and not one in accordance with the tradition which you received from us.

## 2 Thessalonians 3:7

For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example, because we did not act in an undisciplined way among you,

## 2 Thessalonians 3:8

nor did we eat anyoneâ€™s bread without paying for it, but with labour and hardship we kept working night and day so that we would not be a burden to any of you;

## 2 Thessalonians 3:9

not because we do not have the right to this, but in order to offer ourselves as a model for you, so that you would follow our example.

## 2 Thessalonians 3:10

For even when we were with you, we used to give you this order: if anyone is not willing to work, then he is not to eat, either.

## 2 Thessalonians 3:11

For we hear that some among you are leading an undisciplined life, doing no work at all, but acting like busybodies.

## 2 Thessalonians 3:12

Now we command and exhort such people in the Lord Jesus Christ to work peacefully and eat their own bread.

## 2 Thessalonians 3:13

But as for you, brothers and sisters, do not grow weary of doing good.

## 2 Thessalonians 3:14

If anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter, take special note of that person so as not to associate with him, so that he will be put to shame.

## 2 Thessalonians 3:15

And yet do not regard him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.

## 2 Thessalonians 3:16

Now may the Lord of peace Himself continually grant you peace in every circumstance. The Lord be with you all!

## 2 Thessalonians 3:17

I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand, and this is a distinguishing mark in every letter; this is the way I write.

## 2 Thessalonians 3:18

The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
