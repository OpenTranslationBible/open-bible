# 1 Corinthians Chapter 12

## 1 Corinthians 12:1

Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers and sisters, I do not want you to be unaware.

## 1 Corinthians 12:2

You know that when you were pagans, you were led astray to the mute idols, however you were led.

## 1 Corinthians 12:3

Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus is accursed,” and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit.

## 1 Corinthians 12:4

Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit.

## 1 Corinthians 12:5

And there are varieties of ministries, and the same Lord.

## 1 Corinthians 12:6

There are varieties of effects, but the same God who works all things in all persons.

## 1 Corinthians 12:7

But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good.

## 1 Corinthians 12:8

For to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, and to another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit;

## 1 Corinthians 12:9

To another faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit,

## 1 Corinthians 12:10

And to another the effecting of miracles, and to another prophecy, and to another the distinguishing of spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, and to another the interpretation of tongues.

## 1 Corinthians 12:11

But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually just as He wills.

## 1 Corinthians 12:12

For just as the body is one and yet has many parts, and all the parts of the body, though they are many, are one body, so also is Christ.

## 1 Corinthians 12:13

For by one Spirit we were all baptised into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one Spirit.

## 1 Corinthians 12:14

For the body is not one part, but many.

## 1 Corinthians 12:15

If the foot says, “Because I am not a hand, I am not a part of the body,” it is not for this reason any less a part of the body.

## 1 Corinthians 12:16

And if the ear says, “Because I am not an eye, I am not a part of the body,” it is not for this reason any less a part of the body.

## 1 Corinthians 12:17

If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the sense of smell be?

## 1 Corinthians 12:18

But now God has arranged the parts, each one of them in the body, just as He desired.

## 1 Corinthians 12:19

If they were all one part, where would the body be?

## 1 Corinthians 12:20

But now there are many parts, but one body.

## 1 Corinthians 12:21

And the eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you”; or again, the head to the feet, “I have no need of you.”

## 1 Corinthians 12:22

On the contrary, it is much truer that the parts of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary;

## 1 Corinthians 12:23

And those parts of the body which we consider less honourable, on these we bestow greater honour, and our less presentable parts are treated with greater decorum,

## 1 Corinthians 12:24

Whereas our more presentable parts have no need of it. But God has so composed the body, giving more abundant honour to that part which lacked,

## 1 Corinthians 12:25

So that there may be no division in the body, but that the parts may have the same care for one another.

## 1 Corinthians 12:26

And if one part of the body suffers, all the parts suffer with it; if a part is honoured, all the parts rejoice with it.

## 1 Corinthians 12:27

Now you are Christ’s body, and individually parts of it.

## 1 Corinthians 12:28

And God has appointed in the church, first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, and various kinds of tongues.

## 1 Corinthians 12:29

All are not apostles, are they? All are not prophets, are they? All are not teachers? All are not workers of miracles?

## 1 Corinthians 12:30

All do not have gifts of healings, do they? All do not speak in tongues, do they? All do not interpret, do they?

## 1 Corinthians 12:31

But earnestly desire the greater gifts. And yet, I am going to show you a far better way.
