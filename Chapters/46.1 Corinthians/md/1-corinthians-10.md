# 1 Corinthians Chapter 10

## 1 Corinthians 10:1

For I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that our fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea;

## 1 Corinthians 10:2

And they all were baptised into Moses in the cloud and in the sea;

## 1 Corinthians 10:3

And they all ate the same spiritual food,

## 1 Corinthians 10:4

And all drank the same spiritual drink, for they were drinking from a spiritual rock which followed them; and the rock was Christ.

## 1 Corinthians 10:5

Nevertheless, with most of them God was not pleased; for their dead bodies were spread out in the wilderness.

## 1 Corinthians 10:6

Now these things happened as examples for us, so that we would not crave evil things as they indeed craved them.

## 1 Corinthians 10:7

Do not be idolaters, as some of them were; as it is written: “The people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.”

## 1 Corinthians 10:8

Nor are we to commit sexual immorality, as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in one day.

## 1 Corinthians 10:9

Nor are we to put the Lord to the test, as some of them did, and were killed by the snakes.

## 1 Corinthians 10:10

Nor grumble, as some of them did, and were killed by the destroyer.

## 1 Corinthians 10:11

Now these things happened to them as an example, and they were written for our instruction, upon whom the ends of the ages have come.

## 1 Corinthians 10:12

Therefore let the one who thinks he stands watch out that he does not fall.

## 1 Corinthians 10:13

No temptation has overtaken you except something common to mankind; and God is faithful, so He will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also, so that you will be able to endure it.

## 1 Corinthians 10:14

Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.

## 1 Corinthians 10:15

I speak as to sensible people; you then, judge what I say.

## 1 Corinthians 10:16

Is the cup of blessing which we bless not a sharing in the blood of Christ? Is the bread which we break not a sharing in the body of Christ?

## 1 Corinthians 10:17

Since there is one loaf, we who are many are one body; for we all partake of the one loaf.

## 1 Corinthians 10:18

Look at the people of Israel; are those who eat the sacrifices not partners in the altar?

## 1 Corinthians 10:19

What do I mean then? That food sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?

## 1 Corinthians 10:20

No, but I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God; and I do not want you to become partners with demons.

## 1 Corinthians 10:21

You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons; you cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons.

## 1 Corinthians 10:22

Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? We are not stronger than He, are we?

## 1 Corinthians 10:23

All things are permitted, but not all things are beneficial. All things are permitted, but not all things build people up.

## 1 Corinthians 10:24

No one is to seek his own advantage, but rather that of his neighbour.

## 1 Corinthians 10:25

Eat anything that is sold in the meat market without asking questions, for the sake of conscience;

## 1 Corinthians 10:26

For the earth is the Lord’s, and all it contains.

## 1 Corinthians 10:27

If one of the unbelievers invites you and you want to go, eat anything that is set before you without asking questions, for the sake of conscience.

## 1 Corinthians 10:28

But if anyone says to you, “This is meat sacrificed to idols,” do not eat it, for the sake of the one who informed you, and for the sake of conscience;

## 1 Corinthians 10:29

Now by “conscience” I do not mean your own, but the other person's; for why is my freedom judged by another’s conscience?

## 1 Corinthians 10:30

If I partake with thankfulness, why am I slandered about that for which I give thanks?

## 1 Corinthians 10:31

Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all things for the glory of God.

## 1 Corinthians 10:32

Do not offend Jews or Greeks, or the church of God;

## 1 Corinthians 10:33

Just as I also please everyone in all things, not seeking my own benefit but the benefit of the many, so that they may be saved.
