# 1 Corinthians Chapter 8

## 1 Corinthians 8:1

Now concerning food sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge makes one conceited, but love edifies.

## 1 Corinthians 8:2

If anyone thinks that he knows anything, he has not yet known as he ought to know;

## 1 Corinthians 8:3

But if anyone loves God, he is known by Him.

## 1 Corinthians 8:4

Therefore, concerning the eating of food sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing at all in the world, and that there is no God but one.

## 1 Corinthians 8:5

For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, as indeed there are many gods and many lords,

## 1 Corinthians 8:6

Yet for us there is only one God, the Father, from whom are all things, and we exist for Him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we exist through Him.

## 1 Corinthians 8:7

However, not all people have this knowledge; but some, being accustomed to the idol until now, eat food as if it were sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.

## 1 Corinthians 8:8

Now food will not bring us close to God; we are neither the worse if we do not eat, nor the better if we do eat.

## 1 Corinthians 8:9

But take care that this freedom of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak.

## 1 Corinthians 8:10

For if someone sees you, the one who has knowledge, dining in an idolâ€™s temple, will his conscience, if he is weak, not be encouraged to eat things sacrificed to idols?

## 1 Corinthians 8:11

For through your knowledge the one who is weak is ruined, the brother or sister for whose sake Christ died.

## 1 Corinthians 8:12

And so, by sinning against the brothers and sisters and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.

## 1 Corinthians 8:13

Therefore, if food causes my brother to sin, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause my brother to sin.
