# 1 Corinthians Chapter 16

## 1 Corinthians 16:1

Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I directed the churches of Galatia, so you are to do as well.

## 1 Corinthians 16:2

On the first day of every week, each of you is to set aside and save, as he may prosper, so that no collections need to be made when I come.

## 1 Corinthians 16:3

When I arrive, whomever you approve, I will send them with letters to take your gift to Jerusalem;

## 1 Corinthians 16:4

And if it is appropriate for me to go also, they will go with me.

## 1 Corinthians 16:5

But I will come to you after I go through Macedonia, for I am going through Macedonia;

## 1 Corinthians 16:6

And perhaps I will stay with you, or even spend the winter, so that you may send me on my way wherever I go.

## 1 Corinthians 16:7

For I do not want to see you now just in passing; for I hope to remain with you for some time, if the Lord permits.

## 1 Corinthians 16:8

But I will remain in Ephesus until Pentecost;

## 1 Corinthians 16:9

For a wide door for effective service has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.

## 1 Corinthians 16:10

Now if Timothy comes, see that he has nothing to fear while he is with you, for he is doing the Lord’s work, as I also am.

## 1 Corinthians 16:11

So do not look down on him. But send him on his way in peace, so that he may come to me; for I expect him with the brothers.

## 1 Corinthians 16:12

Now concerning our brother Apollos, I strongly encouraged him to come to you with the brothers; and it was not at all his desire to come now, but he will come when he has opportunity.

## 1 Corinthians 16:13

Be on the alert, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong.

## 1 Corinthians 16:14

Let all that you do be done in love.

## 1 Corinthians 16:15

Now I urge you, brothers and sisters: you know the household of Stephanas, that they are the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints,

## 1 Corinthians 16:16

That you also be in subjection to such people and to everyone who helps in the work and labours.

## 1 Corinthians 16:17

I rejoice over the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus, because they have supplied what was lacking on your part.

## 1 Corinthians 16:18

For they have refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore, acknowledge such men.

## 1 Corinthians 16:19

The churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Prisca greet you heartily in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.

## 1 Corinthians 16:20

All the brothers and sisters greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.

## 1 Corinthians 16:21

The greeting is in my own hand—that of Paul.

## 1 Corinthians 16:22

If anyone does not love the Lord, he is to be accursed. Maranatha!

## 1 Corinthians 16:23

The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.

## 1 Corinthians 16:24

My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
