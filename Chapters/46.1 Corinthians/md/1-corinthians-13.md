# 1 Corinthians Chapter 13

## 1 Corinthians 13:1

If I speak with the tongues of mankind and of angels, but do not have love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.

## 1 Corinthians 13:2

If I have the gift of prophecy and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.

## 1 Corinthians 13:3

And if I give away all my possessions to charity, and if I surrender my body so that I may boast, but do not have love, it does me no good.

## 1 Corinthians 13:4

Love is patient, love is kind, it is not jealous; love does not brag, it is not arrogant.

## 1 Corinthians 13:5

It does not act disgracefully, it does not seek its own benefit; it is not provoked, does not keep an account of a wrong suffered,

## 1 Corinthians 13:6

It does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth;

## 1 Corinthians 13:7

It keeps every confidence, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.

## 1 Corinthians 13:8

Love never fails; but if there are gifts of prophecy, they will be done away with; if there are tongues, they will cease; if there is knowledge, it will be done away with.

## 1 Corinthians 13:9

For we know in part, and prophesy in part;

## 1 Corinthians 13:10

But when the perfect comes, the partial will be done away with.

## 1 Corinthians 13:11

When I was a child, I used to speak like a child, think like a child, reason like a child; when I became a man, I did away with childish things.

## 1 Corinthians 13:12

For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face; now I know in part, but then I will know fully, just as I also have been fully known.

## 1 Corinthians 13:13

But now faith, hope, and love remain, these three; but the greatest of these is love.
