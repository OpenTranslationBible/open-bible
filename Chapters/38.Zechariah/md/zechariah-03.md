# Zechariah Chapter 3

## Zechariah 3:1

Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord, and Satan standing at his right to accuse him.

## Zechariah 3:2

And the Lord said to Satan,  
“The Lord rebuke you, Satan!  
Indeed, the Lord who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you!  
Is this not a log snatched from the fire?”

## Zechariah 3:3

Now Joshua was clothed in filthy garments and standing before the angel.

## Zechariah 3:4

And He responded and said to those who were standing before Him,  
“Remove the filthy garments from him.”  
Again He said to him,  
“See, I have taken your guilt away from you and will clothe you with festive robes.”

## Zechariah 3:5

Then I said,  
“Have them put a clean headband on his head.”  
So they put the clean headband on his head and clothed him with garments, while the angel of the Lord was standing by.

## Zechariah 3:6

And the angel of the Lord admonished Joshua, saying,

## Zechariah 3:7

“This is what the Lord of armies says:  
‘If you walk in My ways and perform My service,  
Then you will also govern My house and be in charge of My courtyards,  
And I will grant you free access among these who are standing here.

## Zechariah 3:8

Now listen, Joshua the high priest, you and your friends who are sitting in front of you—indeed they are men who are a symbol,  
For behold, I am going to bring in My servant the Branch.

## Zechariah 3:9

For behold, the stone that I have put before Joshua—on one stone are seven eyes.  
Behold, I am going to engrave an inscription on it,’ declares the Lord of armies,  
‘And I will remove the guilt of that land in one day.

## Zechariah 3:10

On that day,’ declares the Lord of armies,  
‘Every one of you will invite his neighbour to sit under his vine and under his fig tree.’”
