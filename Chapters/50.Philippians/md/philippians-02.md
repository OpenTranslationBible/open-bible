# Philippians Chapter 2

## Philippians 2:1

Therefore if there is any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and compassion,

## Philippians 2:2

Make my joy complete by being of the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose.

## Philippians 2:3

Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility consider one another as more important than yourselves;

## Philippians 2:4

Do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others.

## Philippians 2:5

Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus,

## Philippians 2:6

> Who, as He already existed in the form of God,
> did not consider equality with God something to be grasped,

## Philippians 2:7

> But emptied Himself
> by taking the form of a bond-servant
> and being born in the likeness of men.

## Philippians 2:8

> And being found in appearance as a man,
> He humbled Himself by becoming obedient to the point of death:
> Even death on a cross!

## Philippians 2:9

> For this reason also God highly exalted Him,  
> and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name,

## Philippians 2:10

> So that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow,  
> of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth,

## Philippians 2:11

> And that every tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord,
> to the glory of God the Father.

## Philippians 2:12

So then, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;

## Philippians 2:13

For it is God who is at work in you, both to desire and to work for His good pleasure.

## Philippians 2:14

Do all things without complaining or arguments;

## Philippians 2:15

So that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God without fault in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world,

## Philippians 2:16

Holding firmly the word of life, so that on the day of Christ I can take pride because I did not run in vain nor labour in vain.

## Philippians 2:17

But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and share my joy with you all.

## Philippians 2:18

You too, I urge you, rejoice in the same way and share your joy with me.

## Philippians 2:19

But I hope, in the Lord Jesus, to send Timothy to you shortly, so that I also may be encouraged when I learn of your condition.

## Philippians 2:20

For I have no one else of kindred spirit who will genuinely be concerned for your welfare.

## Philippians 2:21

For they all seek after their own interests, not those of Christ Jesus.

## Philippians 2:22

But you know his proven character, that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child serving his father.

## Philippians 2:23

Therefore I hope to send him immediately, as soon as I see how things go with me;

## Philippians 2:24

And I trust in the Lord that I myself also will be coming shortly.

## Philippians 2:25

But I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and minister to my need,

## Philippians 2:26

Because he was longing for you all and was distressed because you had heard that he was sick.

## Philippians 2:27

For indeed he was sick, to the point of death, but God had mercy on him, and not only on him but also on me, so that I would not have sorrow upon sorrow.

## Philippians 2:28

Therefore I have sent him all the more eagerly, so that when you see him again you may rejoice and I may be less concerned.

## Philippians 2:29

Receive him then in the Lord with all joy, and hold people like him in high regard,

## Philippians 2:30

Because he came close to death for the work of Christ, risking his life to compensate for your absence in service to me.
