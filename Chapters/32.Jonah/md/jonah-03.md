# Jonah Chapter 3

## Jonah 3:1

Now the word of the Lord came to Jonah the second time, saying,

## Jonah 3:2

“Arise, go to Nineveh, the great city, and proclaim to it the message which I am going to tell you.”

## Jonah 3:3

So Jonah got up and went to Nineveh according to the word of the Lord. Now Nineveh was an exceedingly large city, a three days’ walk.

## Jonah 3:4

Then Jonah began to go through the city one day’s walk; and he cried out and said,

“In forty more days, Nineveh will be overthrown.”

## Jonah 3:5

Then the people of Nineveh believed in God; and they called a fast and put on sackcloth, from the greatest to the least of them.

## Jonah 3:6

When the word reached the king of Nineveh, he got up from his throne, removed his robe from himself, covered himself with sackcloth, and sat on the dust.

## Jonah 3:7

And he issued a proclamation, and it said,

“In Nineveh, by the decree of the king and his nobles:  
No person, animal, herd, or flock is to taste anything.  
They are not to eat or drink water.

## Jonah 3:8

But every person and animal must be covered with sackcloth;  
And people are to call on God vehemently,  
And they are to turn, each one from his evil way,  
And from the violence which is in their hands.

## Jonah 3:9

Who knows, God may turn and relent,  
And turn from His burning anger so that we will not perish.”

## Jonah 3:10

When God saw their deeds, that they turned from their evil way, then God relented of the disaster which He had declared He would bring on them. So He did not do it.
