# Jonah Chapter 2

## Jonah 2:1

Then Jonah prayed to the Lord his God from the stomach of the fish,

## Jonah 2:2

And he said,

> “I called out of my distress to the Lord,  
> And He answered me.  
> I cried for help from the depth of Sheol;  
> You heard my voice.

## Jonah 2:3

> For You threw me into the deep,  
> Into the heart of the seas,  
> And the current flowed around me.  
> All Your breakers and waves passed over me.

## Jonah 2:4

> So I said, ‘I have been cast out of Your sight.  
> Nevertheless, I will look again toward Your holy temple.’

## Jonah 2:5

> Water encompassed me to the point of death.  
> The deep flowed around me,  
> Seaweed was wrapped around my head.

## Jonah 2:6

> I descended to the base of the mountains.  
> The earth with its bars was around me forever,  
> But You brought up my life from the pit, Lord my God.

## Jonah 2:7

> While I was fainting away,  
> I remembered the Lord,  
> And my prayer came to You,  
> Into Your holy temple.

## Jonah 2:8

> Those who are followers of worthless idols  
> Abandon their faithfulness,

## Jonah 2:9

> But I will sacrifice to You  
> With a voice of thanksgiving.  
> That which I have vowed I will pay.  
> Salvation is from the Lord.”

## Jonah 2:10

Then the Lord commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah up onto the dry land.
