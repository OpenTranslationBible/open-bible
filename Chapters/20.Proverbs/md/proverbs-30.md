# Proverbs Chapter 30

## Proverbs 30:1

The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, the pronouncement.  
The man declares to Ithiel, to Ithiel and Ucal:

## Proverbs 30:2

I am more stupid than any man,  
And I do not have the understanding of a man;

## Proverbs 30:3

Nor have I learned wisdom,  
Nor do I have knowledge of the Holy One.

## Proverbs 30:4

Who has ascended into heaven and descended?  
Who has gathered the wind in His fists?  
Who has wrapped the waters in His garment?  
Who has established all the ends of the earth?  
What is His name, or His Son’s name?  
Surely you know!

## Proverbs 30:5

Every word of God is pure;  
He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him.

## Proverbs 30:6

Do not add to His words,  
Or He will rebuke you, and you will be proved a liar.

## Proverbs 30:7

Two things I asked of You;  
Do not withhold them from me before I die:

## Proverbs 30:8

Keep deception and lies far from me,  
Give me neither poverty nor riches;  
Feed me with the food that is my portion,

## Proverbs 30:9

So that I will not be full and deny You and say, “Who is the Lord?”  
And that I will not become impoverished and steal,  
And profane the name of my God.

## Proverbs 30:10

Do not slander a slave to his master,  
Or he will curse you and you will be found guilty.

## Proverbs 30:11

There is a generation that curses its father  
And does not bless its mother.

## Proverbs 30:12

There is a generation that is pure in its own eyes,  
Yet is not washed from its filthiness.

## Proverbs 30:13

There is a generation—how haughty are their eyes!  
And their eyelids are raised in arrogance.

## Proverbs 30:14

There is a generation whose teeth are like swords  
And its jaw teeth like knives,  
To devour the poor from the earth  
And the needy from among mankind.

## Proverbs 30:15

The leech has two daughters: “Give,” “Give.”  
There are three things that will not be satisfied,  
Four that will not say, “Enough”:

## Proverbs 30:16

Sheol, the infertile womb,  
Earth that is never satisfied with water,  
And fire that never says, “Enough.”

## Proverbs 30:17

The eye that mocks a father  
And scorns obedience to a mother,  
The ravens of the valley will pick it out,  
And the young eagles will eat it.

---

## Proverbs 30:18

There are three things that are too wonderful for me,  
Four that I do not understand:

## Proverbs 30:19

The way of an eagle in the sky,  
The way of a serpent on a rock,  
The way of a ship in the middle of the sea,  
And the way of a man with a maiden.

## Proverbs 30:20

This is the way of an adulterous woman:  
She eats and wipes her mouth,  
And says, “I have done nothing wrong.”

---

## Proverbs 30:21

Under three things the earth quakes,  
And under four, it cannot endure:

## Proverbs 30:22

Under a slave when he becomes king,  
And a fool when he is satisfied with food,

## Proverbs 30:23

Under an unloved woman when she gets a husband,  
And a female servant when she displaces her mistress.

---

## Proverbs 30:24

Four things are small on the earth,  
But they are exceedingly wise:

## Proverbs 30:25

The ants are not a strong people,  
But they prepare their food in the summer;

## Proverbs 30:26

The rock hyraxes are not mighty people,  
Yet they make their homes in the rocks;

## Proverbs 30:27

The locusts have no king,  
Yet all of them go out in ranks;

## Proverbs 30:28

The lizard you may grasp with the hands,  
Yet it is in kings’ palaces.

---

## Proverbs 30:29

There are three things that are stately in their march,  
Four that are stately when they walk:

## Proverbs 30:30

The lion, which is mighty among animals  
And does not retreat from anything,

## Proverbs 30:31

The strutting rooster, the male goat also,  
And a king when his army is with him.

---

## Proverbs 30:32

If you have been foolish in exalting yourself  
Or if you have plotted evil, put your hand on your mouth.

## Proverbs 30:33

For the churning of milk produces butter,  
And pressing the nose produces blood;  
So pressing anger produces strife.
