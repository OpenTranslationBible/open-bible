# Proverbs Chapter 26

## Proverbs 26:1

Like snow in summer and rain in harvest,

Like a sparrow in its flitting, like a swallow in its flying,  
So a curse without cause does not come to rest.

## Proverbs 26:3

A whip is for the horse, a bridle for the donkey,  
And a rod for the back of fools.

## Proverbs 26:4

Do not answer a fool according to his foolishness,  
Or you will also be like him.

## Proverbs 26:5

Answer a fool as his foolishness deserves,  
So that he will not be wise in his own eyes.

## Proverbs 26:6

One who sends a message by the hand of a fool  
Cuts off his own feet and drinks violence.

## Proverbs 26:7

Like legs that are useless to the lame,  
So is a proverb in the mouth of fools.

## Proverbs 26:8

Like one who binds a stone in a sling,  
So is one who gives honour to a fool.

## Proverbs 26:9

Like a thorn that sticks in the hand of a heavy drinker,  
So is a proverb in the mouth of fools.

## Proverbs 26:10

Like an archer who wounds everyone,  
So is one who hires a fool or those who pass by.

## Proverbs 26:11

Like a dog that returns to its vomit,  
So a fool repeats his foolishness.

## Proverbs 26:12

Do you see a person wise in his own eyes?  
There is more hope for a fool than for him.

## Proverbs 26:13

The lazy one says, “There is a lion on the road!  
A lion is in the public square!”

As the door turns on its hinges,  
So does the lazy one on his bed.

The lazy one buries his hand in the dish;  
He is weary of bringing it to his mouth again.

Than seven people who can give a discreet answer.

## Proverbs 26:17

Like one who seizes a dog by the ears  
Is a passer-by who meddles in strife not belonging to him.

## Proverbs 26:18

Like a maniac shooting flaming arrows and death,

## Proverbs 26:19

So is a person who deceives his neighbour,  
And says, “Was I not joking?”

## Proverbs 26:20

Where there is no wood, the fire goes out,  
And where there is no gossiper, conflict quiets down.

## Proverbs 26:21

Like charcoal to hot embers and wood to fire,  
So is a contentious person to kindle strife.

## Proverbs 26:22

The words of a gossiper are like dainty morsels,  
And they go down into the innermost parts of the body.

## Proverbs 26:23

Like a silver coating on earthenware  
Are burning lips and a wicked heart.

## Proverbs 26:24

One who hates disguises it with his lips,  
But he harbours deceit in his heart.

## Proverbs 26:25

When he speaks graciously, do not believe him,  
For there are seven abominations in his heart.

## Proverbs 26:26

Though his hatred covers itself with deception,  
His wickedness will be revealed in the assembly.

## Proverbs 26:27

One who digs a pit will fall into it,  
And one who rolls a stone, it will come back on him.

## Proverbs 26:28

A lying tongue hates those it crushes,  
And a flattering mouth causes ruin.
