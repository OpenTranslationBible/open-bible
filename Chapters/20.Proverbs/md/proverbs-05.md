# Proverbs Chapter 5

## Proverbs 5:1

My son, pay attention to my wisdom,  
Incline your ear to my understanding,

## Proverbs 5:2

So that you may maintain discretion,  
And your lips may comply with knowledge.

## Proverbs 5:3

For the lips of the forbidden woman drip honey,  
And her speech is smoother than oil;

## Proverbs 5:4

But in the end she is bitter as wormwood,  
Sharp as a two-edged sword.

## Proverbs 5:5

Her feet go down to death,  
Her steps follow the path to Sheol.

## Proverbs 5:6

She does not ponder the path of life;  
Her ways are unstable, she does not know it.

## Proverbs 5:7

Now then, my sons, listen to me,  
And do not turn away from the words of my mouth.

## Proverbs 5:8

Keep your way far from her,  
And do not go near the door of her house,

## Proverbs 5:9

Lest you give your honour to others,  
And your years to the cruel one;

## Proverbs 5:10

Lest strangers be filled with your strength,  
And your labours go to the house of a foreigner;

## Proverbs 5:11

And you groan at your final end,  
When your flesh and your body are consumed;

## Proverbs 5:12

And you say, “How I hated instruction!  
And my heart spurned reproof!

## Proverbs 5:13

I did not listen to the voice of my teachers,  
Nor incline my ear to my instructors!

## Proverbs 5:14

I was almost in utter ruin  
In the midst of the assembly and congregation.”

## Proverbs 5:15

Drink water from your own cistern  
And fresh water from your own well.

## Proverbs 5:16

Should your springs be dispersed abroad,  
Streams of water in the streets?

## Proverbs 5:17

Let them be yours alone  
And not for strangers with you.

## Proverbs 5:18

Let your fountain be blessed,  
And rejoice in the wife of your youth.

## Proverbs 5:19

Like a loving doe and a graceful mountain goat,  
> Let her breasts satisfy you at all times;  
> Be exhilarated always with her love.

## Proverbs 5:20

Why should you, my son, be exhilarated with a forbidden woman  
And embrace the bosom of a foreigner?

---

## Proverbs 5:21

For the ways of a person are before the eyes of the Lord,  
And He watches all his paths.

## Proverbs 5:22

His own wrongdoings will trap the wicked,  
And he will be held by the cords of his sin.

## Proverbs 5:23

He will die for lack of instruction,  
And in the greatness of his folly he will go astray.
