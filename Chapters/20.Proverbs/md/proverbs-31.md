# Proverbs Chapter 31

## Proverbs 31:1

The words of King Lemuel, the pronouncement which his mother taught him:

## Proverbs 31:2

What, my son? And what, son of my womb?  
And what, son of my vows?

## Proverbs 31:3

Do not give your strength to women,  
Or your ways to that which destroys kings.

## Proverbs 31:4

It is not for kings, Lemuel,  
It is not for kings to drink wine,  
Or for rulers to desire intoxicating drink,

## Proverbs 31:5

So that they will not drink and forget what is decreed,  
And pervert the rights of all the needy.

## Proverbs 31:6

Give intoxicating drink to one who is perishing,  
And wine to one whose life is bitter.

## Proverbs 31:7

Let him drink and forget his poverty,  
And not remember his trouble any longer.

## Proverbs 31:8

Open your mouth for the people who cannot speak,  
For the rights of all the unfortunate.

## Proverbs 31:9

Open your mouth, judge righteously,  
And defend the rights of the poor and needy.

## Proverbs 31:10

An excellent wife, who can find her?  
For her worth is far above jewels.

## Proverbs 31:11

The heart of her husband trusts in her,  
And he will have no lack of gain.

## Proverbs 31:12

She does him good and not evil  
All the days of her life.

## Proverbs 31:13

She looks for wool and linen,  
And works with her hands in delight.

## Proverbs 31:14

She is like merchant ships;  
She brings her food from afar.

## Proverbs 31:15

She rises while it is still night  
And gives food to her household,  
And portions to her attendants.

## Proverbs 31:16

She considers a field and buys it;  
From her earnings she plants a vineyard.

## Proverbs 31:17

She surrounds her waist with strength  
And makes her arms strong.

## Proverbs 31:18

She senses that her gain is good;  
Her lamp does not go out at night.

## Proverbs 31:19

She stretches out her hands to the distaff,  
And her hands grasp the spindle.

## Proverbs 31:20

She extends her hand to the poor,  
And she stretches out her hands to the needy.

## Proverbs 31:21

She is not afraid of the snow for her household,  
For all her household are clothed with scarlet.

## Proverbs 31:22

She makes coverings for herself;  
Her clothing is fine linen and purple.

## Proverbs 31:23

Her husband is known in the gates,  
When he sits among the elders of the land.

## Proverbs 31:24

She makes linen garments and sells them,  
And supplies belts to the tradesmen.

## Proverbs 31:25

Strength and dignity are her clothing,  
And she smiles at the future.

## Proverbs 31:26

She opens her mouth in wisdom,  
And the teaching of kindness is on her tongue.

## Proverbs 31:27

She watches over the activities of her household,  
And does not eat the bread of idleness.

## Proverbs 31:28

Her children rise up and bless her;  
Her husband also, and he praises her, saying:

## Proverbs 31:29

“Many daughters have done nobly,  
But you excel them all.”

## Proverbs 31:30

Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain,  
But a woman who fears the Lord, she shall be praised.

## Proverbs 31:31

Give her the product of her hands,  
And let her works praise her in the gates.
