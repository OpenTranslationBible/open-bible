# Proverbs Chapter 1

## Proverbs 1:1

The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:

## Proverbs 1:2

To know wisdom and instruction,  
To discern the sayings of understanding,

## Proverbs 1:3

To receive instruction in wise behaviour,  
Righteousness, justice, and integrity;

## Proverbs 1:4

To give prudence to the naive,  
To the youth knowledge and discretion.

## Proverbs 1:5

A wise person will hear and increase in learning,  
And a person of understanding will acquire wise counsel,

## Proverbs 1:6

To understand a proverb and a saying,  
The words of the wise and their riddles.

## Proverbs 1:7

The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge;  
Fools despise wisdom and instruction.

## Proverbs 1:8

Listen, my son, to your father's instruction,  
And do not forsake your mother's teaching;

## Proverbs 1:9

For they are a graceful garland for your head  
And necklaces for your neck.

---

## Proverbs 1:10

My son, if sinners entice you,  
Do not consent.

## Proverbs 1:11

If they say,  
“Come with us,  
> Let us lie in wait for blood,  
> Let us ambush the innocent without cause;

## Proverbs 1:12

Let us swallow them alive like Sheol,  
> Whole, like those who go down to the pit;

## Proverbs 1:13

We will find all kinds of valuable possessions,  
> We will fill our houses with plunder;

## Proverbs 1:14

Throw in your lot with us;  
> We will all have one money bag,”

## Proverbs 1:15

My son, do not walk on the path with them,  
Keep your feet from their way.

## Proverbs 1:16

For their feet run to evil,  
And they are quick to shed blood.

## Proverbs 1:17

Indeed, it is useless to spread the baited net  
In the sight of any bird;

## Proverbs 1:18

But they lie in wait for their own blood,  
They ambush their own lives.

## Proverbs 1:19

Such are the ways of everyone who makes unjust gain;  
It takes away the life of those who possess it.

## Proverbs 1:20

Wisdom shouts in the street,  
She raises her voice in the public square;

## Proverbs 1:21

At the head of the noisy streets she cries out,  
At the entrance of the gates in the city she declares her sayings:

## Proverbs 1:22

“How long, you naive ones, will you love simplistic thinking?  
> And how long will scoffers delight in their scoffing,  
> And fools hate knowledge?

## Proverbs 1:23

Turn to my reproof,  
> Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you;  
> I will make my words known to you.

## Proverbs 1:24

Because I called and you refused,  
I stretched out my hand and no one paid attention;

## Proverbs 1:25

And you neglected all my advice,  
And did not want my rebuke;

## Proverbs 1:26

I also will laugh at your disaster;  
I will mock when your dread comes,

---

## Proverbs 1:27

When your dread comes like a storm,  
And your disaster comes like a whirlwind,  
When distress and anguish come upon you.

## Proverbs 1:28

Then they will call on me, but I will not answer;  
They will seek me diligently but will not find me,

## Proverbs 1:29

Because they hated knowledge,  
And did not choose the fear of the Lord.

## Proverbs 1:30

They would not accept my advice,  
They disdainfully rejected all my rebuke.

## Proverbs 1:31

So they shall eat of the fruit of their own way,  
And be filled with their own schemes.

## Proverbs 1:32

For the turning away of the naive will kill them,  
And the complacency of fools will destroy them.

## Proverbs 1:33

But whoever listens to me will live securely,  
And will be at ease from the dread of evil.
