# Luke Chapter 20

## Luke 20:1

On one of the days while He was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the gospel,  
the chief priests and the scribes, with the elders, came up to Him,

## Luke 20:2

and they spoke, saying to Him,  
“Tell us by what authority You are doing these things, or who is the one who gave You this authority?”

## Luke 20:3

But He replied to them,  
“I will also ask you a question, and you tell Me:

## Luke 20:4

Was the baptism of John from heaven, or from men?”

## Luke 20:5

They discussed it among themselves, saying,  
“If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will say, ‘Why did you not believe him?’

## Luke 20:6

But if we say, ‘From men,’ all the people will stone us to death,  
since they are convinced that John was a prophet.”

## Luke 20:7

And so they answered that they did not know where it came from.

## Luke 20:8

And Jesus said to them,  
“Neither am I telling you by what authority I do these things.”

## Luke 20:9

But He began to tell the people this parable:  
“A man planted a vineyard, and leased it to vine-growers, and went on a journey for a long time.

## Luke 20:10

At the harvest time he sent a slave to the vine-growers,  
so that they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard;  
but the vine-growers beat him and sent him away empty-handed.

## Luke 20:11

And he proceeded to send another slave; but they beat him also and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed.

## Luke 20:12

And he proceeded to send a third; but this one, too, they wounded and threw out.

## Luke 20:13

Now the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What am I to do? I will send my beloved son;  
perhaps they will respect him.’

## Luke 20:14

But when the vine-growers saw him, they discussed it among themselves, saying,  
‘This is the heir; let’s kill him so that the inheritance will be ours!’

## Luke 20:15

And so they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.  
What, then, will the owner of the vineyard do to them?

## Luke 20:16

He will come and put these vine-growers to death, and will give the vineyard to others.”  
When they heard this, they said, “May it never happen!”

## Luke 20:17

But Jesus looked at them and said,  
“What then is this statement that has been written:

> ‘A stone which the builders rejected,  
> This has become the chief cornerstone’?

## Luke 20:18

Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces;  
but on whomever it falls, it will crush him.”

## Luke 20:19

The scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on Him that very hour,  
and yet they feared the people; for they understood that He spoke this parable against them.

---

## Luke 20:20

And so they watched Him closely, and sent spies who pretended to be righteous,  
in order that they might catch Him in a statement,  
so that they could hand Him over to the jurisdiction and authority of the governor.

## Luke 20:21

And they questioned Him, saying,  
“Teacher, we know that You speak and teach correctly, and You are not partial to anyone,  
but You teach the way of God on the basis of truth.

## Luke 20:22

Is it permissible for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?”

## Luke 20:23

But He saw through their trickery and said to them,

## Luke 20:24

“Show Me a denarius. Whose image and inscription does it have?”  
They said, “Caesar’s.”

## Luke 20:25

And He said to them,  
“Then pay to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”

## Luke 20:26

And they were unable to catch Him in a statement in the presence of the people;  
and they were amazed at His answer, and said nothing.

## Luke 20:27

Now some of the Sadducees (who say that there is no resurrection) came to Him,

## Luke 20:28

and they asked Him a question, saying,  
“Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies,  
leaving a wife, and he is childless, his brother is to marry the wife and raise up children for his brother.

## Luke 20:29

So then, there were seven brothers;  
and the first took a wife and died childless,

## Luke 20:30

and the second,

## Luke 20:31

and the third married her; and in the same way all seven died, leaving no children.

## Luke 20:32

Finally the woman also died.

## Luke 20:33

In the resurrection, therefore, which one’s wife does the woman become?  
For all seven had married her.”

## Luke 20:34

Jesus said to them,  
“The sons of this age marry and the women are given in marriage,

## Luke 20:35

but those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead,  
neither marry nor are given in marriage;

## Luke 20:36

for they cannot even die anymore, because they are like angels, and are sons of God,  
being sons of the resurrection.

## Luke 20:37

But regarding the fact that the dead are raised,  
even Moses revealed this in the passage about the burning bush,  
where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.

## Luke 20:38

Now He is not the God of the dead, but of the living; for all live to Him.”

## Luke 20:39

Some of the scribes answered and said,  
“Teacher, You have spoken well.”

## Luke 20:40

For they did not have the courage to question Him any longer about anything.

---

## Luke 20:41

But He said to them,  
“How is it that they say the Christ is David’s son?

## Luke 20:42

For David himself says in the book of Psalms,

> ‘The Lord said to my Lord,  
> “Sit at My right hand,

## Luke 20:43

> Until I make Your enemies
> a footstool for Your feet.”’

## Luke 20:44

Therefore David calls Him ‘Lord,’ and how is He his son?”

---

## Luke 20:45

And while all the people were listening, He said to the disciples,

## Luke 20:46

“Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes,  
and love personal greetings in the marketplaces,  
and the seats of honour in the synagogues, and places of honour at banquets,

## Luke 20:47

who devour widows’ houses, and for appearance’s sake offer long prayers.  
These will receive all the more condemnation.”
