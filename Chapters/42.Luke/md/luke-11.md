# Luke Chapter 11

## Luke 11:1

It happened that while Jesus was praying in a certain place, after He had finished,  
one of His disciples said to Him,  
“Lord, teach us to pray, just as John also taught his disciples.”

## Luke 11:2

And He said to them,  
“When you pray, say:

> ‘Father, hallowed be Your name.  
> Your kingdom come.

## Luke 11:3

> Give us each day our daily bread.

## Luke 11:4

> And forgive us our sins,  
> For we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us.  
> And do not lead us into temptation.’”

## Luke 11:5

And He also said to them,  
“Suppose one of you has a friend, and goes to him at midnight and says to him,  
‘Friend, lend me three loaves,

## Luke 11:6

because a friend of mine has come to me from a journey and I have nothing to serve him’;

## Luke 11:7

and from inside he answers and says,  
‘Do not bother me; the door has already been shut and my children and I are in bed;  
I cannot get up and give you anything.’

## Luke 11:8

I tell you, even if he will not get up and give him anything just because he is his friend,  
yet because of his shamelessness he will get up and give him as much as he needs.

## Luke 11:9

So I say to you, ask, and it will be given to you;  
seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.

## Luke 11:10

For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds,  
and to the one who knocks, it will be opened.

## Luke 11:11

Now which one of you fathers will his son ask for a fish, and instead of a fish, he will give him a snake?

## Luke 11:12

Or he will even ask for an egg, and his father will give him a scorpion?

## Luke 11:13

So if you, despite being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children,  
how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him?”

## Luke 11:14

And He was casting out a demon, and it was mute;  
when the demon had gone out, the man who was previously unable to speak talked, and the crowds were amazed.

## Luke 11:15

But some of them said,  
“He casts out the demons by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons.”

## Luke 11:16

Others, to test Him, were demanding of Him a sign from heaven.

## Luke 11:17

But He knew their thoughts and said to them,  
“Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste; and a house divided against itself falls.

## Luke 11:18

And if Satan also has been divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand?  
For you claim that I cast out the demons by Beelzebul.

## Luke 11:19

Yet if I cast out the demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out?  
Therefore, they will be your judges.

## Luke 11:20

But if I cast out the demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.

## Luke 11:21

When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own house, his possessions are secure.

## Luke 11:22

But when someone stronger than he attacks him and overpowers him,  
he takes away his armour on which he had relied, and distributes his plunder.

## Luke 11:23

The one who is not with Me is against Me; and the one who does not gather with Me scatters.

---

## Luke 11:24

“When the unclean spirit comes out of a person, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, and not finding any,  
it then says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came.’

## Luke 11:25

And when it comes, it finds it swept and put in order.

## Luke 11:26

Then it goes and brings along seven other spirits more evil than itself,  
and they come in and live there; and the last condition of that person becomes worse than the first.”

---

## Luke 11:27

While Jesus was saying these things, one of the women in the crowd raised her voice and said to Him,  
“Blessed is the womb that carried You, and the breasts at which You nursed!”

## Luke 11:28

But He said,  
“On the contrary, blessed are those who hear the word of God, and follow it.”

---

## Luke 11:29

Now as the crowds were increasing, He began to say,  
“This generation is a wicked generation; it demands a sign,  
and so no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.

## Luke 11:30

For just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so will the Son of Man be to this generation.

## Luke 11:31

The Queen of the South will rise up with the men of this generation at the judgement and condemn them,  
because she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon;  
and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.

## Luke 11:32

The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgement with this generation and condemn it,  
because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and behold, something greater than Jonah is here.

## Luke 11:33

“No one lights a lamp and puts it away in a cellar, nor under a basket, but on the lampstand,  
so that those who enter may see the light.

## Luke 11:34

The eye is the lamp of your body; when your eye is clear, your whole body also is full of light;  
but when it is bad, your body also is full of darkness.

## Luke 11:35

So watch out that the light in you is not darkness.

## Luke 11:36

If, therefore, your whole body is full of light, with no dark part in it,  
it will be wholly illumined, as when the lamp illumines you with its rays.”

## Luke 11:37

Now when He had spoken, a Pharisee _asked Him_ to have lunch with him;  
and He went in and reclined at the table.

## Luke 11:38

When the Pharisee saw this, he was surprised that He had not first ceremonially washed before the meal.

## Luke 11:39

But the Lord said to him,  
“Now, you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and of the dish,  
but inside you are full of greed and wickedness.

## Luke 11:40

You foolish ones, did He who made the outside not also make the inside?

## Luke 11:41

But give that which is within as a charitable gift, and then all things are clean for you.

---

## Luke 11:42

“But woe to you Pharisees! For you pay tithes of mint, rue, and every garden herb,  
and yet you ignore justice and the love of God;  
but these are the things you should have done without neglecting the others.

## Luke 11:43

Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the seat of honour in the synagogues, and personal greetings in the marketplaces.

## Luke 11:44

Woe to you! For you are like unseen tombs, and the people who walk over them are unaware of it.”

---

## Luke 11:45

One of the lawyers _said to Him in reply_,  
“Teacher, when You say these things, You insult us too!”

## Luke 11:46

But He said,  
“Woe to you lawyers as well!  
For you load people with burdens that are hard to bear,  
while you yourselves will not even touch the burdens with one of your fingers.

## Luke 11:47

Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets,  
and it was your fathers who killed them.

## Luke 11:48

So you are witnesses and approve of the deeds of your fathers,  
because they killed them, and you build their tombs.

## Luke 11:49

For this reason also, the wisdom of God said,  
‘I will send them prophets and apostles,  
and some of them they will kill, and some they will persecute,

## Luke 11:50

so that the blood of all the prophets, shed since the foundation of the world,  
may be charged against this generation,

## Luke 11:51

from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the house of God;  
yes, I tell you, it will be charged against this generation!’

## Luke 11:52

Woe to you lawyers! For you have taken away the key of knowledge;  
you yourselves did not enter, and you hindered those who were entering.”

---

## Luke 11:53

When He left there, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be very hostile and to interrogate Him closely on many subjects,

## Luke 11:54

plotting against Him to catch Him in something He might say.
