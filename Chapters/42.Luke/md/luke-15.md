# Luke Chapter 15

## Luke 15:1

Now all the tax collectors and sinners were coming near Jesus to listen to Him.

## Luke 15:2

And both the Pharisees and the scribes began to complain, saying,  
“This man receives sinners and eats with them.”

## Luke 15:3

And so He told them this parable, saying,

## Luke 15:4

“What man among you, if he has a hundred sheep and has lost one of them,  
does not leave the other ninety-nine in the open pasture and go after the one that is lost, until he finds it?

## Luke 15:5

And when he has found it, he puts it on his shoulders, rejoicing.

## Luke 15:6

And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbours, saying to them,  
‘Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost!’

## Luke 15:7

I tell you that in the same way, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents  
than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need of repentance.

## Luke 15:8

“Or what woman, if she has ten silver coins and loses one coin,  
does not light a lamp and sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it?

## Luke 15:9

And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbours, saying,  
‘Rejoice with me, because I have found the coin which I had lost!’

## Luke 15:10

In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”

## Luke 15:11

And He said, “A man had two sons.

## Luke 15:12

The younger of them said to his father,  
‘Father, give me the share of the estate that is coming to me.’  
And so he divided his wealth between them.

## Luke 15:13

And not many days later, the younger son gathered everything together and went on a journey to a distant country,  
and there he squandered his estate in wild living.

## Luke 15:14

Now when he had spent everything, a severe famine occurred in that country, and he began doing without.

## Luke 15:15

So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country,  
and he sent him into his fields to feed pigs.

## Luke 15:16

And he longed to have his fill of the carob pods that the pigs were eating,  
and no one was giving him anything.

## Luke 15:17

But when he came to his senses, he said,  
‘How many of my father’s hired labourers have more than enough bread,  
but I am dying here from hunger!

## Luke 15:18

I will set out and go to my father, and will say to him,  
“Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight;

## Luke 15:19

I am no longer worthy to be called your son; treat me as one of your hired labourers.”’

## Luke 15:20

So he set out and came to his father.  
But when he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion for him,  
and ran and embraced him and kissed him.

## Luke 15:21

And the son said to him,  
‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight;  
I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’

## Luke 15:22

But the father said to his slaves,  
‘Quickly bring out the best robe and put it on him,  
and put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet;

## Luke 15:23

and bring the fattened calf, slaughter it, and let’s eat and celebrate;

## Luke 15:24

for this son of mine was dead and has come to life again;  
he was lost and has been found.’  
And they began to celebrate.

---

## Luke 15:25

“Now his older son was in the field; and when he came and approached the house, he heard music and dancing.

## Luke 15:26

And he summoned one of the servants and began inquiring what these things could be.

## Luke 15:27

And he said to him, ‘Your brother has come, and your father has slaughtered the fattened calf  
because he has received him back safe and sound.’

## Luke 15:28

But he became angry and was not willing to go in;  
and his father came out and began pleading with him.

## Luke 15:29

But he answered and said to his father,  
‘Look! For so many years I have been serving you, and I have never neglected a command of yours;  
and yet you never gave me a young goat, so that I might celebrate with my friends;

## Luke 15:30

but when this son of yours came, who has devoured your wealth with prostitutes,  
you slaughtered the fattened calf for him!’

## Luke 15:31

And he said to him,  
‘Son, you have always been with me, and all that is mine is yours.

## Luke 15:32

But we had to celebrate and rejoice,  
because this brother of yours was dead and has begun to live, and was lost and has been found.’”
