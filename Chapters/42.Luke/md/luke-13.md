# Luke Chapter 13

## Luke 13:1

Now on that very occasion there were some present who reported to Him about the Galileans  
whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.

## Luke 13:2

And Jesus responded and said to them,  
“Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered this fate?

## Luke 13:3

No, I tell you, but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.

## Luke 13:4

Or do you think that those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them  
were worse offenders than all the other people who live in Jerusalem?

## Luke 13:5

No, I tell you, but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.”

## Luke 13:6

And He began telling this parable:  
“A man had a fig tree which had been planted in his vineyard;  
and he came looking for fruit on it and did not find any.

## Luke 13:7

And he said to the vineyard-keeper, ‘Look, for three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree without finding any.  
Cut it down! Why does it even use up the ground?’

## Luke 13:8

But he answered and said to him, ‘Sir, leave it alone for this year too, until I dig around it and put in fertilizer;

## Luke 13:9

and if it bears fruit next year, fine; but if not, cut it down.’”

## Luke 13:10

Now He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.

## Luke 13:11

And there was a woman who for eighteen years had a sickness caused by a spirit;  
and she was bent over and could not straighten up at all.

## Luke 13:12

When Jesus saw her, He called her over and said to her,  
“Woman, you are freed from your sickness.”

## Luke 13:13

And He laid His hands on her; and immediately she stood up straight again, and began glorifying God.

## Luke 13:14

But the synagogue leader, indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath,  
began saying to the crowd in response,  
“There are six days during which work should be done;  
so come during them and get healed, and not on the Sabbath day.”

## Luke 13:15

But the Lord answered him and said,  
“You hypocrites, does each of you not untie his ox or his donkey from the stall on the Sabbath  
and lead it to water?

## Luke 13:16

And this woman, a daughter of Abraham as she is,  
whom Satan has bound for eighteen long years,  
should she not have been released from this restraint on the Sabbath day?”

## Luke 13:17

And as He said this, all His opponents were being humiliated;  
and the entire crowd was rejoicing over all the glorious things being done by Him.

---

## Luke 13:18

So He was saying,  
“What is the kingdom of God like, and to what shall I compare it?

## Luke 13:19

It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and threw into his own garden;  
and it grew and became a tree, and the birds of the sky nested in its branches.”

---

## Luke 13:20

And again He said,  
“To what shall I compare the kingdom of God?

## Luke 13:21

It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour until it was all leavened.”

---

## Luke 13:22

And He was passing through one city and village after another, teaching, and proceeding on His way to Jerusalem.

## Luke 13:23

And someone said to Him,  
“Lord, are there just a few who are being saved?”  
And He said to them,

## Luke 13:24

“Strive to enter through the narrow door;  
for many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able.

## Luke 13:25

Once the head of the house gets up and shuts the door,  
and you begin standing outside and knocking on the door, saying, ‘Lord, open up for us!’  
and then He will answer and say to you, ‘I do not know where you are from,’

## Luke 13:26

then you will begin saying, ‘We ate and drank in Your presence, and You taught in our streets!’

## Luke 13:27

And yet He will say, ‘I do not know where you are from; leave Me, all you evildoers.’

## Luke 13:28

In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth  
when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God,  
but you yourselves being thrown out.

## Luke 13:29

And they will come from east and west, and from north and south,  
and will recline at the table in the kingdom of God.

## Luke 13:30

And behold, some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last.”

---

## Luke 13:31

At that very time some Pharisees approached, saying to Him,  
“Go away and leave this place, because Herod wants to kill You!”

## Luke 13:32

And He said to them,  
“Go and tell that fox, ‘Behold, I am casting out demons and performing healings today and tomorrow,  
and on the third day I reach My goal.’

## Luke 13:33

Nevertheless, I must go on My journey today and tomorrow, and the next day;  
for it cannot be that a prophet would perish outside Jerusalem.

---

## Luke 13:34

Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those sent to her!  
How often I wanted to gather your children together, just as a hen gathers her brood under her wings,  
and you were unwilling!

## Luke 13:35

Behold, your house is left to you desolate;  
and I say to you, you will not see Me until the time comes when you say,  
‘Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!’”
