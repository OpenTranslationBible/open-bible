# Habakkuk Chapter 1

## Habakkuk 1:1

The pronouncement which Habakkuk the prophet saw:

## Habakkuk 1:2

> How long, Lord, have I called for help, and You do not hear?  
> I cry out to You, “Violence!” yet You do not save.

## Habakkuk 1:3

> Why do You make me see disaster,  
> And make me look at destitution?  
> Yes, devastation and violence are before me;  
> Strife exists and contention arises.

## Habakkuk 1:4

> Therefore the Law is ignored,  
> And justice is never upheld.  
> For the wicked surround the righteous;  
> Therefore justice comes out confused.

## Habakkuk 1:5

> “Look among the nations! Watch!  
> Be horrified! Be frightened speechless!  
> For I am accomplishing a work in your days—  
> You would not believe it even if you were told!

## Habakkuk 1:6

> For behold, I am raising up the Chaldeans,  
> That grim and impetuous people  
> Who march throughout the earth  
> To take possession of dwelling places that are not theirs.

## Habakkuk 1:7

> They are terrifying and feared;  
> Their justice and authority originate with themselves.

## Habakkuk 1:8

> Their horses are faster than leopards,  
> And quicker than wolves in the evening.  
> Their horsemen charge along,  
> Their horsemen come from afar;  
> They fly like an eagle swooping down to devour.

## Habakkuk 1:9

> All of them come for violence.  
> Their horde of faces moves forward.  
> They gather captives like sand.

## Habakkuk 1:10

> They make fun of kings,  
> And dignitaries are an object of laughter to them.  
> They laugh at every fortress,  
> Then heap up dirt and capture it.

## Habakkuk 1:11

> Then they fly along like the wind and pass on.  
> But they will be held guilty,  
> They whose strength is their god.”

## Habakkuk 1:12

> Are You not from time everlasting,  
> Lord, my God, my Holy One?  
> We will not die.  
> You, Lord, have appointed them to deliver judgment;  
> And You, O Rock, have destined them to punish.

## Habakkuk 1:13

> Your eyes are too pure to look at evil,  
> And You cannot look at harm favourably.  
> Why do You look favourably  
> At those who deal treacherously?  
> Why are You silent when the wicked swallow up  
> Those more righteous than they?

## Habakkuk 1:14

> Why have You made people like the fish of the sea,  
> Like crawling things that have no ruler over them?

## Habakkuk 1:15

> The Chaldeans bring all of them up with a hook,  
> Drag them away with their net,  
> And gather them together in their fishing net.  
> Therefore they rejoice and are joyful.

## Habakkuk 1:16

> Therefore they offer a sacrifice to their net  
> And burn incense to their fishing net,  
> Because through these things their catch is large,  
> And their food is plentiful.

## Habakkuk 1:17

> Will they therefore empty their net,  
> And continually slay nations without sparing?
