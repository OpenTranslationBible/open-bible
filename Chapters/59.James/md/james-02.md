# James Chapter 2

## James 2:1

My brothers and sisters, do not hold your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with an attitude of personal favouritism.

## James 2:2

For if a man comes into your assembly with a gold ring and is dressed in bright clothes, and a poor man in dirty clothes also comes in,

## James 2:3

and you pay special attention to the one who is wearing the bright clothes, and say, “You sit here in a good place,” and you say to the poor man, “You stand over there, or sit down by my footstool,”

## James 2:4

have you not made distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil motives?

## James 2:5

Listen, my beloved brothers and sisters: did God not choose the poor of this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which He promised to those who love Him?

## James 2:6

But you have dishonoured the poor man. Is it not the rich who oppress you and personally drag you into court?

## James 2:7

Do they not blaspheme the good name by which you have been called?

## James 2:8

If, however, you are fulfilling the royal law according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbour as yourself,” you are doing well.

## James 2:9

But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the Law as violators.

## James 2:10

For whoever keeps the whole Law, yet stumbles in one point, has become guilty of all.

## James 2:11

For He who said, “Do not commit adultery,” also said, “Do not murder.” Now if you do not commit adultery, but do murder, you have become a violator of the Law.

## James 2:12

So speak, and so act, as those who are to be judged by the law of freedom.

## James 2:13

For judgment will be merciless to one who has shown no mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment.

## James 2:14

What use is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone says he has faith, but he has no works? Can that faith save him?

## James 2:15

If a brother or sister is without clothing and in need of daily food,

## James 2:16

and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” yet you do not give them what is necessary for their body, what use is that?

## James 2:17

In the same way, faith also, if it has no works, is dead, being by itself.

## James 2:18

But someone may well say, “You have faith and I have works; show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works.”

## James 2:19

You believe that God is one. You do well; the demons also believe, and shudder.

## James 2:20

But are you willing to acknowledge, you foolish person, that faith without works is useless?

## James 2:21

Was our father Abraham not justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar?

## James 2:22

You see that faith was working with his works, and as a result of the works, faith was perfected;

## James 2:23

and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “And Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness,” and he was called a friend of God.

## James 2:24

You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.

## James 2:25

In the same way, was Rahab the prostitute not also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way?

## James 2:26

For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.
